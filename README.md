# [SuiSense](https://suisense.space/)

Using NLP to distinguish suicidal messages and provide personalized support.

SuiSense is a unique progressive web application that allows concerned family and friends to determine whether their struggling loved one is on the path to suicide. The core of our project is a Natural Language Processing model(sci-kit) that classifies a phrase someone says as representing suicidal tendencies, depression, or neither. Users can input text from their messaging conversations, memory of their in-person conversations, letters, diary entries, or screenshots (powered by TessaractOCR). Classifying between suicide and depression is important because the implications and methods for support are completely different, but determining the difference is a precise task that is best dealt with through ML.
