## Overview of our Project

SuiSense is a unique progressive web application that allows concerned family and friends to determine whether their struggling loved one is on the path to suicide. The core of our project is a Natural Language Processing model(sci-kit) that classifies a phrase someone says as representing suicidal tendencies, depression, or neither. Users can input text from their messaging conversations, memory of their in-person conversations, letters, diary entries, or screenshots. Classifying between suicide and depression is important because the implications and methods for support are completely different, but determining the difference is a precise task that is best dealt with through ML.
