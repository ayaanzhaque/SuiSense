Beating myself up every. single. day. for just being \"lazy\", and \"not being able to get it together\", as well as struggling with the thought that i somehow just tricked everybody (including the doctors) into thinking that i have depression when really i dont. 🥴  \n",
      "Anyways, after another horrifying therapy session of me complaining that i am really just a piece of shit that only wants to sleep 24/7, wasting her life away not accomplishing anything, my therapist urged me to list all the things which i do DO and sort of look at them from afar and try to practice gratitude and appreciation. Here it is:\n",

      "1) most days, I am able to make myself brush my teeth and on the good days even take a shower  \n",

      "3) roughly once a week I may feel like putting on makeup and doing my nails  \n",
      "4) i am able to socialize with my best friend and truly enjoy our evenings together, which is a huge one  \n",
      "5) i am now able to recognise that the meds do really help and I stopped having hysterical breakdowns and intrusive, disturbing thoughts  \n",
      "6) i have never missed a day of therapy  \n",
      "7) even though my sleep schedule is non-existence (sleeping every 4 hours during the course of a day) I still pull myself out of bed, have breakfast, maybe out on some clothes and go out to work in a cafe, even if for just an hour\n",

       "1813  My family has owned a fine dining italian restaurant since before i was born. Most all of my childhood memories are in that restaurant. Everyday after school i’d go do my homework at the bar, i’d follow my dad around the kitchen and help with little things like making salads, and i will never forget making my first pizza at 4 years old. Whenever it stormed really bad and we lost power my family would go and sleep on the floor in the dining room — it was always a safe space. It was always somewhere for us to go, something for us to do, something that needed constant watering and attention. It’s been my family’s livelihood for my entire existence. It’s kept my belly full as well as my heart. It’s my father’s lifelong work and it’s made me respect him sooo much after 30 years of being there to cook for 14+ hours a day. I don’t know who i’d be without this restaurant. It’s shaped me in ways that i couldn’t possibly explain over a reddit post. It’s made me confident, brave, not scared o...   \n",
       "1814  First of all, I’m not Japanese. I came to Japan about 12 years ago to work as a programmer in Tokyo as a contractual job. A couple years of that and I felt I love it here, so I decided to live in Japan and took a full-time job.\\n\\nFortunately, my personality fits the culture and I feel like I’m thriving here. There are pros and cons in every single country, of course, and Japan is no exception. But I feel the pros outweigh the cons, so I’m a bit biased. \\n\\nI’ve lived in both the urban metropolis and the provincial rural towns. My current neighborhood is a suburb that’s somewhere in the middle. Less than an hour from central Tokyo, yet surrounded by forests and mountains, two rivers, and everything is walkable.\\n\\nI realized that there are a lot of people on Reddit who are interested in Japan, both lovers and haters. If you have anything you want to know, I’ll try to answer it with what I know and have experienced.\\n\\nIf you’re not comfortable in making your post public, you can ju...   \n",
