      "Hi! I've been battling depression for the past two years, officially diagnosed in summer 2019, currently on medication &amp; therapy. Beating myself up every. single. day. for just being \"lazy\", and \"not being able to get it together\", as well as struggling with the thought that i somehow just tricked everybody (including the doctors) into thinking that i have depression when really i dont. 🥴  \n",
      "Anyways, after another horrifying therapy session of me complaining that i am really just a piece of shit that only wants to sleep 24/7, wasting her life away not accomplishing anything, my therapist urged me to list all the things which i do DO and sort of look at them from afar and try to practice gratitude and appreciation. Here it is:\n",
      "\n",
      "1) most days, I am able to make myself brush my teeth and on the good days even take a shower  \n",
      "2) i could have given up on all work  to kind of \"sleep through\" my depression (my partner can support me financially with no trouble) however as tempting as it is I still do the work (working remotely from home) and recently took on a big project, which I was debating declining but still didn't (no idea how and if  im going to handle it but ill update you on here)  \n",
      "3) roughly once a week I may feel like putting on makeup and doing my nails  \n",
      "4) i am able to socialize with my best friend and truly enjoy our evenings together, which is a huge one  \n",
      "5) i am now able to recognise that the meds do really help and I stopped having hysterical breakdowns and intrusive, disturbing thoughts  \n",
      "6) i have never missed a day of therapy  \n",
      "7) even though my sleep schedule is non-existence (sleeping every 4 hours during the course of a day) I still pull myself out of bed, have breakfast, maybe out on some clothes and go out to work in a cafe, even if for just an hour\n",

       "1752  At first I was mad that I would still have to work when everyone else gets two paid weeks off. But then they explained that the reason food service workers will still be expected to report for work is that we have a lot of kids in our district that qualify for free school lunch. For a lot of these kids, the food they get at school may be the only meals they get during the week. We have to keep feeding these kids, not only because they deserve to eat, but also because if they aren’t eating, their immune systems will take a hit and they could be more at risk for COVID-19. \\n\\nEven though I would love two weeks off to rest, I feel proud to be a lunch lady and to be feeding these kids who need it!\\n\\n\\nEdit: Wow, wow, wow! I really didn’t expect this post to get so much attention! Thank you all so much for your kind words and encouragement! I posted this with the intent to let people know that kids from low-income families will be fed, at least in many places that are closing schools, ...   \n",
