###Summary###

**Anyone who, while acting as a helper, invites or accepts private contact (I.e. PMs, chat, or any kind of offsite communication) early in the conversion is showing either bad intentions or bad judgement.  Either way, it's unwise to trust them.** 


""PM me anytime"" seems like a kind and generous offer. And it might be perfectly well-meaning, but, unless and until a solid rapport has been established, it's just not a wise idea.  Here are some points to consider before you offer or accept an invitation to communicate privately.

* **By posting supportive replies publicly, you'll help more people than just the OP. If your responses are of good quality, you'll educate and inspire other helpers.** [The 1-9-90 rule](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1%25_rule_(Internet_culture\)) applies here as much as it does anywhere else on the internet.  

* People who are struggling with serious mental-health issues often (justifiably) have a low tolerance for disappointment and a high-level of ever-changing emotional need. **Unless the helper is able to make a 100% commitment to be there for them in every way, for as long as necessary, offering a personal inbox as a resource is likely to do more harm than good.** This is why mental-health crisis-line responders usually don't give their names and callers aren't allowed to request specific responders.  It's much healthier and safer for the callers to develop a relationship with the agency as a whole.  Analogously, it's much safer and healthier for our OPs to develop a relationship with the community as a whole.  Even trained responders are generally not allowed to work high-intensity situations alone.  It's partly about availability, but it's mostly about wider perspective and preventing compassion fatigue. 

* **If a helper gets in over their head with someone whose mental-health issues (including suicidality, which is often comorbid with depression) escalate, in a PM conversation it's much harder for others, including the /r/depression and /r/SuicideWatch moderators to help**.  (Contrary to common assumptions, moderators can't see or police PMs.)  

* In our observation over many years, the people who say ""PM me"" the most are consistently the ones with the least understanding of mental-health issues and mental-health support. We all have gaps in our knowledge and in our ability to communicate effectively.  Community input mitigates these limitations. **There's no reason why someone who's truly here to help would want to hide their responses from community scrutiny**.  If helpers are concerned about their own privacy, keep in mind that self-disclosure, when used supportively, is more about the feelings than the details, and that we have no problem here with the use of alt/throwaway accounts, and have no restrictions on account age or karma.  

*  We all know the internet is used by some people to exploit or abuse others.  These people *do* want to hide their deceptive and manipulative responses from everyone except their victims. There are many of them who specifically target those who are vulnerable because of mental-health issues. **If a helper invites an OP to talk privately and gives them a good, supportive experience, they've primed that person to be more vulnerable to abusers.** This sort of cognitive priming tends to be particularly effective when someone's in a state of mental-health crisis, when people rely more on heuristics than critical reasoning.

* If OPs want to talk privately, posting on a wide-open anonymous forum like reddit might not be the best option. Although we don't recommend it, we do allow OPs to request private contact when asking for support. If you want to do this, please keep your expectations realistic, and to have a careful look at the history of anyone who offers to PM before opening up to them.",t2_1t70,False,,0,False,"Our most-broken and least-understood rules is ""helpers may not invite private contact as a first resort"", so we've made a new wiki to explain it",[],r/depression,False,0,,0,,False,t3_doqwow,False,dark,1.0,,public,2322,1,{},,False,[],,False,False,,{},,False,2322,,True,,False,,[],{},,True,,1572389522.0,text,0,,,text,self.depression,True,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;We understand that most people who reply immediately to an OP with an invitation to talk privately  mean only to help, but this type of response usually leads to either disappointment or disaster.  it usually works out quite differently here than when you say &amp;quot;PM me anytime&amp;quot; in a casual social context.  &lt;/p&gt;

,depression,"A couple of months ago it was really bad. I genuinely wanted to die. I know people say they don't want to die, they want to be dead or they just want to escape the pain, but i genuinely wanted to die. I was gonna do it one day because I was just so done, but I was so physically and mentally tired and wasn't ready because I just wanted to sleep. I went home and the next day we went into quarantine. I know quarantine has been bad for most people but it stopped me from doing it the next day or day after. Not sure if that was a good thing.

In quarantine things got a bit better, only a little but I didn't want to die anymore, just escape the pain. That's lasted for about two months and I can once again feel that I want to die again. Genuinely. I don't care anymore. I'm trying to do well on my tests and grades to not disappoint everyone all over again but it all feels so overwhelming. When I go to school, the entire day I hide my face because I know how gross and ugly I look. I don't want to repulse people or see their dirty looks. This has been going on for about 4-5 years and I feel so incredibly mentally drained all the time.

There was a period last year where things improved significantly and I thought I was better for a while. I have now concluded that it didn't really leave, just lessened. My mind feels dull and grey, numb. My emotions feel almost far away? Like the huge wall of numbness is blocking me from them. I still feel happiness sometimes? But it feels more like a repressed temporary amusement. I don't actually like the feeling. It feels wrong.

I am 13 years old and almost 14. Can't wait to hear about how I'm just a dramatic and edgy teen. I've honestly doubted myself because other's situations have been much worse than mine so I don't feel like I have a right to feel this way. Sometimes I feel like I'm faking all this which makes me loath myself even more. I can't begin to describe the hatred I have for myself. I am/was going through a very unique family court situation. The final decision has been made of who I stay with. Finally. After NINE years. I hate court. My whole life has literally revolved around it.

I can't remember what it feels like without this numbness. I literally can't remember, I'm not exaggerating. In primary school I thought there was something wrong with me because I never felt happy. Never. I can't imagine how people can be so energetic and excited when it all just looks so boring and exhausting. The only way I can describe what the world is like and what I feel is just this: Tired, so so tired. I'm so tired. I feel like I'm so old. Like I've experienced enough exhaustion for a life time that can't be regenerated, now it's time to go. It's just getting worse, i feel like I genuinely want to die again. and it only ever gets worse.

I don't know why I wrote any of this. This is not a call for help. Maybe I'm just putting my thought down. I feel like because I really just don't care, I just want to see what happens, what peoples responses will be. I have so many more thoughts and this barely even grazes the surface.

He masked his pain and never showed any signs.

He refuses to get help.
We loved each other a lot.
I still do.
But he’s been feeling numb and broke it off with me and doesn’t want me to contact him.

I don’t have anyone to talk to about it because I’m so ashamed about being emotionally/mentally weak. I can’t let anyone know my insecurities because I fear they’ll know how pathetic I truly am. 

1. I am so damn lonely. I have “friends and family” and I call and text them...but they never call me, check in on me. When we see each other in person they seem disinterested in what I have to share or say.  I’ve realized that maybe we aren’t as close as I thought we were.  I feel like I don’t matter at all.

2. I feel like a failure. I’m a high school drop out, I’ve been fired from almost every job I’ve had, and went to online college. I try my hardest at my job but I feel like sometimes I just don’t get it. It’s so complicated and I make so many errors despite my best efforts. I fear I will never be able to be a person who has their “shit together” and excels in life.

3. I have no idea what my life’s purpose is. I see so many people online and irl that have this drive and passion, and I try my hardest to explore mine...to no avail. What is my life’s purpose? To pay taxes to make sure the roads are paved? I feel unfulfilled and misguided.

4. I hate my appearance.  I’m 30 years old now and time is starting to show. Extra fat everywhere, wrinkles, fallen face, saggy cellulite body. I try to diet and exercise, but I have no self control. I can do it for a few days and then resort back to over eating and laziness.  Since the pandemic hit I’ve started a diet/exercise routine probably 5x different times.

5.  I can’t overcome my addictions.  Cigarettes, alcohol, sugar and overeating. I’ve tried quitting probably 3x in the past 3 months. I can do it for about a week and then fall off the wagon. I feel so little happiness from my life that my vices are the only thing that gives me pleasure. 

6. Anxiety. I feel so overwhelmed with worry, fear, self consciousness, or being out of control that sometimes I shake, sweat, get dizzy spells, can’t breathe, get heart palpitations, and tunnel vision. It’s has caused problems at work, because I have to stop whatever it is I’m doing and go for walk or get fresh air. My bosses ask what’s wrong with me, but I’m too shamed to tell the truth.

7. I have no skills. I try to learn to paint, play drums, draw, sew, garden...but I just can’t develop the ability necessary to excel at these skills. I am very envious of talented people and wish I were one of them. I follow them closely online and practically idolize them.

Once I realised what I had done I regretted so badly, as the new reality was so much worse than what I had. From there it was a slow, steady and cruel downhill of an entire year. I couldn't sleep. Then I was dead at work. Started to have issues to relate with new colleagues especially boss. I was missing the old ones so badly. Then I've seen a doctor. Started therapies. Took pills. I've tried three different pills and two different therapists. Had time off. Simply could not recover. And then it was over. After losing the job everything deteriorated.

I don't really like getting close to co-workers for some reason either. I am more introverted.

While it is positive that I even signed back up for classes, it also makes my anxiety go ballistic when I think about working full time to keep up with bills, keeping up with school, and trying to keep my head above water, both mentally and physically (self care). I also have to upkeep the home I rent and do other normal life tasks, etc. (Exhausting in it's own right). The state of the world is also killing my spirit. It's sad but I'm basically hoping for the rapture. I take welbutrin. Seems to help somewhat with the depression. Idk. It's the only one I've tried. I am engaged, and feel like if I can't find out how to be happy, I will lose her. Again, more anxiety. It's difficult to find joy in anything.

,depression,"I am 18 years old, turning 19 soon. But I don't feel 18, I don't feel like an adult yet. The way I act is very childish. I have never been able to be independent, ever since I was young, Ive depended on others. I suffer from anxiety, but back then, I only thought I was shy. I would never be able to do anything on my own, and still can't to this day. I've had depression ever since I was in 7th grade, but it's also genetic, since my mum also suffers from it. I have also been diagnosed with high functioning Autism.

When I was a child, I couldn't do anything by myself, I depended on others. For example, I would only do something if my sister would be there too. I wouldn't be able to do anything alone. The person I depended on would always change though, growing up with my sister, it would be my sister that I would want to be around in order to do anything. But then it changed to my friends, I had to be with them all the time, especially during class. Which caused me so much stress because I wouldn't always be in the same class as them. I ended up having so many panic attacks when I was away from them because I couldn't function by myself. In 12th grade, I had 3 friends (including my boyfriend) one of them eventually left the school, this ended up cause a lot of trauma for me. Back when I was in 7th grade, I lost all my friends and was alone most the time. That's when I started getting extremely depressed. That depression has never ended. So when my friend left, my life went to shit again. I had all my classes with her, and only her. My other friend didn't hang out with us anymore because she didn't want to hang out with a couple because that's just awkward for the lot of us. It was just me and my boyfriend. Because of all this trauma I experienced during this time, I clung to him. He was all I had and I didn't want to be alone.

 As of now, my boyfriend is still the person I depend on, I don't go to school anymore. We hang out all the time and when he can't I have extreme panic attacks because I don't know what to do with myself when I'm away from him. I don't do well alone, I get flashbacks of what happened in the past, when I was left alone. I experience suicidal thoughts daily. There isn't a single day that goes by, where I don't hate myself. I don't know what to do, I know this is all wrong and unhealthy, I know that. Its just so hard. I feel like my Adolescent days have messed me up so bad. I feel like I haven't had the time to properly grow up, maybe that's why I feel this way? I really don't know. I just wish I'd never been born at all. I don't know what to do.

I thought I would have everything planned out from this point, but I'm still torn. I know that ""it's up to me"" and ""only I can decide"", but it makes me feel even more lost whenever I try to decide. I just feel so behind. I've already waisted enough time, now that I'm in classes, I would like to have a goal after I finish my required classes. I feel lost whenever I talk to anyone or try to reach out, too. I made a post attempting to talk to someone somewhere else about what I'd been feeling, and it just straight up got ignored. I don't know why I bother sometimes. I usually talk to my boyfriend or my therapist, but my therapist is probably busy working again and my boyfriend is half way across the world in a different time zone, so I can't always reach him.

,depression,"I've struggled with depression for as long as I can remember. My entire formative years up until this point now. I believe it stems from a lack of community and lack of personal connection I feel with any people at all due to bullying and ostracism in high school for no real reason but that's besides the point. 

I (26F) have always had to pull myself out of holes. It always amazes me when someone says a friend came and forced them out of whatever pain spiral they were in because I know no one is coming for me. It's ingrained in my mind somehow that this depression is a me problem and I shouldn't rely on anyone else to help me or fix me. Logically I know it's not weakness to need help but honestly it doesn't make any difference because no one is coming regardless. 

I feel like every experience in my life has been tainted with the sadness. It's like a thick tar enveloping and seeping through any and all cracks in the moments and corrupting them. Usually I can enjoy things but as of late I feel like I'm drowning in this vast ocean of fucking black tar. 

I've tried everyday my whole life to fix my problems. I am extremely active and intelligent (probably a touch narcissistic) and have never let my depression effect my work, studies or productivity. I would call it high functioning I guess. When I couldn't cope in high school I threw my 4.0 GPA and college acceptances out to the wind and enlisted in the Marine Corps. I thought that change- that structure and community- would make it better. It didn't. I took up skydiving while I was in and have continued it for years and while its a quick adrenalin fix I'm labeled with my pain as soon as I have my parachute picked up from the ground. Because of skydiving I know I don't want to die, plummeting with your head pointed at the ground at 180 mph gives you a choice, and I will always choose to break away and deploy. 

I'm in the middle of I think the worst depression crisis of my life. I've always felt bad but I've never felt this bad. I've never just cried randomly or gotten so overwhelmed I sit on my kitchen floor sobbing for 2 hours. I was used to the every couple of days intrinsic thought of hey just drive off a bridge or something but now these thoughts surround me and suffocate me. I bought a little anchor for my stand up paddleboard and all I could and still think about is tying it to my foot and throwing it overboard. The biggest deterrent to this is that it is likely not heavy enough to keep me down. I exercise a lot and now when I do I just keep crying. I biked 12 miles the other day and cried the whole time. It's been like this for weeks.

I'm at the end of my rope, and when I say this I truly wholeheartedly mean it. I can't cope with anything and for the first time my work has begun to suffer for it. I reached out to the VA for psychiatric care and the earliest they can get me in for a therapist is july 15th and for a psychiatrist is july 30th. Imagine reaching out in the worst crisis of your life and them telling you to wait over a month. I've since reached out to my university and they gave me an appointment for today.

I can't do anything to make myself feel better anymore. I went shopping for new clothes because I lost 30 pounds since august (intentionally) and turned in my larges for smalls. That in it of itself feels really good and for the first time ever I looked in the mirror in the dressing room and really liked what I saw. I hadn't really looked at myself in a long time and I was impressed. This somehow made me feel worse. 

Why is it that everyone has these friends, these communities, people that care and this priviledge is denied to me? What is fundamentally wrong with me that I am not allowed a place in the world other than the grave I've been digging for 13 years?

Edit to add: I'm going to school for biochem because I want to be a psychiatrist, because I love helping people with their mental troubles. I'm all of my friends pocket therapist and I wouldnt have it any other way. 

I try to talk to people about this but they say things like 'you have so much going for you, look at your goals and accomplishments!' Goals and accomplishments dont prevent people from being sad, I am a living breathing example of that.

,depression,"I tried to meditate.

Picturing a blank slate.

Forcing the memories and emotions back,

like they don't exist.

But it was hard clearing my mind; My thoughts run rapid like a white river.

Unrestrained,

best left untouched,

but used as a bipolar campaign.

I use to have a dam.

One that worked,

and could have stand for another decade.

With big bold words,

painted on its walls.

""I have no problems;""

the saying said,

and in return to finish this motto,

""You have no problems.""

It felt like lies,

parroting these words that hurt,

and have others say the same things worked.

For it kept the walls maintained,

and strong.

Until one day the dam crumble,

with no cause.

There's a little voice who conspired it,

to be an inside job.

But conspiracy won't save or rebuild the dam.

For the man-made lake flooded the world.

The system that tried to take back control.

Couldn't stop the poison sinking into the soil;

feeding the trees and the wildlife

who depend on this water to live.

The strong currents of these emotions,

pulled me under it's rapid white surface.

No one could see or find me right then,

I'd be miles down river dead or by chance breathing.

Being pushed and bashed,

against the boulders.

Scrapes and bruises,

appear on my skin.

Broken bones that snapped like twigs.

The air in my lungs burn,

as I try not to breathe in but it will be replaced,

with what I tried to keep out.

25 seconds seems to be my limit.

Adapt to change is better than remaining the same,

but this dreamer turned into a fish; a salmon.

The season will come,

when I'll have to make the journey up river again.

Back through the memories.

Inside an old reverie.

Hoping by chance,

I won't get caught in the jaws of a bear,

or be lured away by a fisherman's bait.

Pushing my way up in the deepness of my pain,

Until I reached the end.

The cycle then begins again.

Why?

Because I've died from the exhaustion,

Never stopping until I met the goals end.

It's a cruel nature to live in,

but there are positive things that happen.

My body,

will rot with nutrients,

My children,

will grow and start the story again.

It's a rebirth,

of living and dying.

Lying and crying.

Holding back what should never be said.

It's better to hold your tongue than let a sharp edge slip.

Repressing my emotions,

not to feel.

A decision made not to heal.

I want to escape the fate I placed myself in,

This environment,

that's my oppression.

At the same time,

my own aggression.

We're not the same,

you and I.

This empathy we feel,

is probably all we'll have.

This song and poem will be said,

to be the same,

Yet, our lyrics are different,

the tunes and beats.

Maybe they'll switch.

We both know it was organic,

what we wrote and feel in the moment.

The mental illness I have,

is a drug and disease.

I already don't trust anyone,

so why should I speak?

They keep comparing me to them and others.

I'm not the same,

if I am.

Then why am I not cured like them?

I think it's time I finish what I wrote.

My eyes are red from the salt.

I pick the worse time to cry.

I thank you for reading,

so, for right now.

&lt;p&gt;At the same time,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;my own aggression.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We&amp;#39;re not the same,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;you and I.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This empathy we feel,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;is probably all we&amp;#39;ll have.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This song and poem will be said,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;to be the same,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yet, our lyrics are different,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;the tunes and beats.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Maybe they&amp;#39;ll switch.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We both know it was organic,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;what we wrote and feel in the moment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The mental illness I have,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;is a drug and disease.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I already don&amp;#39;t trust anyone,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;so why should I speak?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They keep comparing me to them and others.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m not the same,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;if I am.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then why am I not cured like them?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think it&amp;#39;s time I finish what I wrote.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My eyes are red from the salt.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I pick the worse time to cry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I thank you for reading,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;so, for right now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Goodbye.&lt;/p&gt;

,depression,"I'm depressed. I'm in my mid 20's and I've been so since I was a teenager. It wasn't a constant stream of it, it was more like peaks and valleys, but nontheless it was there. The thing with it is that it just gets worse. The peaks that used to be the tops of mountains now are barely hills and every new valley is deeper and darker than the one I passed before.

The worst of it is that I know is something inside my head. There's something inside that I must fix in order to reach a plateau . A sunny one. Because I know what I have to do in order to reach it. It's not really that hard, I've done it a number of times already. But I just can't be bothered to. The effort seems too big and the results will fade with time. I will let them fade because it's comfortble and easy that way. Maybe I'm just used to it. Maybe I've just done it so many times that is in my nature. Maybe I'm just looking for a struggle and since I can't seem to fin it outside my head I create it inside of it. The problem is when finally something happens outside and I'm not up to the task because all my energy is focused inside of me. And I just see it pass me, as other things have passed me before. And here we are again, sinking deeper and deeper into the botomless pit. Thinking I'm trying to swim to the top when in reality I know I'm barely moving my feet. I like the darkness, I don't want to like it but I do. And I like it because every second I listen to it I take another step down. And there's nothing I want more in this moment than to go down.

Funny thing isn't it. Winter came and brought with it what it always brings. Last year I went as deep as I'd never went before and thought I'd learned from it. I did, but not as much as I thought. But now here I am. Thinking of walking that path again in hopes of achieving god knows what. Who am I trying to fool, I know exactly what I'm after. 

I've always thought of myself as a collection of I's, my native tongue doesn't have a distinction between Me and I as english does and I believe the latter makes more sense, I wanted to make that clear but for the sake of grammar I'll use me from now on.

Each different me has different objectives, and they fight for the control of my mind. They are not different from me, they are me.  They are carried by emotions and they are mostly blinded by them so its hard for them to see the bigger picture, they need me for that. But they don't always listen and I don't always want to fight against them, and to be honest sometimes I just let them free, even in situations in which I know I shouldn't do so. Right now I've let one of those I's to control my head, the witty snake crept on me and whisper by whisper convinced me to lower my guard and let it in. And now I'm numbed, and my will is lost and I just want to hear it's sweet voice whispering inside my head saying how useless I am. And by doing so I'm making it's point true. And I'm guided by him even deeper.

I usually write posts like this and never post them, I think that I write them more for myself than for anyone else but I'll change that for today. Maybe is that naiff hope that someone will give me the key to open the lock and break free of these chains or maybe sharing it is a step in the right direction.

,depression,"All my friends have been having a hard time going through quarantine. Meanwhile it hasn’t really changed my life in any significant way. I’ve been had dysthymia with episodes of double depression for 8 years now. Can’t meet up with friends? Can’t go out? Can’t party? Can’t go to cinema/concert/theater/restaurant?

,depression,"BACKSTORY:
I'm a 19 year old boy raised in a broken family: mentally abused, socially isolated in my younger years and never felt loved, that kind of stuff. I developped poor social skills and as a result I became good at distancing myself from other people, to give myself some credit, when I do succeed in feeling good, people would say I'm a funny guy. I'm aware that my lack of friends and poor social skills is just the result of my lack of trying and not having lots of experience to learn from. I'd be honest here, since there's no merit in lying: as a last resort I stole 10k from my parents that my brother found in an enveloppe my mom hid somewhere a long time ago, knowing that they've probably forgotten it by now (my brother tend to look around out of curiosity and sometimes he finds stuff like this, he's not to blame, I am). I will make no excuses for my behaviour as I'm aware that this will make me a criminal for stealing 10k from my parents, I am willing to give perspective as to why: Obviously my relationship with my parents isn't the greatest, I'm willing to assume that they have their own mental struggles/battles which would have influenced how they behaved, but it doesn't excuse how they treated me in my childhood. I was 18 when I stole it and I did it because in my head I was certain that if I were to stay in this house for much longer, I would certainly kill myself some time in the near future. So in my eyes, this 10k was a second chance in life to live on my own and finance my studies with (which they didn't pay for anyway). My brother knew of my plans and although he didn't agree with it, he did understand why I would want to do it, I just couldn't take it anymore. 

So flashforward, my dream of my second chance in life crashed down horribly: the after-effects of my childhood trauma still haunts me to this current day. It was nice living on my own ngl, definitely nicer than living with my parents, that opinion hasn't changed. I did construct this plan that I'd get financial aid from the government social security net in the hopes that I pass my university, but that failed due to me still coping with depression. It wasn't only the depression, I just had that phase like most teens where they aren't sure what they wanted to do, so my course wasn't interesting to me. I'd also take the blame to me not caring much about school to properly search seriously to begin with, I just didnt had any interest in any of the courses they had to offer in my eyes. I forgot to mention, that this is my SECOND time failing university, both because of depression (one year living with my parents, one on my own). In Belgium you have this credit system where you get a certain amount of credits (120) and each year would cost 60, the credits you'd get back to continue your studies depends on how well you did. I failed twice, so I didn't had enough credits to start another year at university, which would force me to start working if I wish to continue living on my own. 

Okay so that takes me to my current situation in life: 19, no friends, no family, some money (~12k, I had some savings as well), about to lose the financial aid or that's what I'm assuming, failed university twice, I also struggle with acne and I take great importance of looking good, because I believe that people are more willing to be nicer if you look good (I used to be a fairly attractive guy, so I speak of experience that people, mainly girls, will indeed treat you nicer), I also just want the confidence that u get when u know that you look good. But most importantly, I was still unloved, so I'm also struggling with feeling unloveable. 

I predict that with my current money I could probably survive about 6+ months if I stayed unemployed. Working seems tedious and I'm mainly concerned if I'd find any friends, since I had a hard time making friends in school, I presume from now on it would only become even harder. I don't see any point in living if you aren't enjoying your life, and I am certainly not. There are moments when I think about my life and how it could all have been better if I had a loving family. The only thing I'd ever change if I were to be reborn in this same body, is to have a kind loving family, I don't need the money, looks (since I do believe I'm fairly good looking, even with some imperfections) or anything else. I think that if I had a loving supportive family I could have achieved great things, rather than the spiteful, shameful borderline criminal life I'm living right now. But yeah I'm stoic about it, I can't go back now. I have plans and I have a pretty good method of killing myself peacefully and realistically, a way to bypass my natural instinct to not wanting to die (you hear these stories about the survival instinct kicking in). My date is set somewhere in the early 2021, my dying wish is just that I could do something good to someone/something I care deeply about, without going through more suffering. Currently I'm thinking of a way to do that.



PERSONAL OPINIONS:
Okay now that the tragic backstory is out of the way, time for some perspectives/opinions:
1) Ofcourse maybe this is because I'm suicidal, but I believe a right to die with assisted suicide should exist, why must we live? Even when I'm not depressed I was always pro-choice. Some may say ""but you're depressed and depression impairs with your freedom of will, you dont want to die you just dont want to continue feeling this way"", okay, like wtf don't I have a choice then? Is it just because I'm mentally ill that I lose my right to choice what I want with my own life? As long as I pay for the treatment, there shouldn't be any discussion, even if it costs like 10k I'd GLADLY pay that amount. And yes okay, I don't want to die indeed, I don't want to continue feeling this way, yes that's correct. I know I can change, but how long do I have to continue missing out on life and continue suffering along the process??? I'm currently 19 almost 20 and I feel like I wasted the most important part of my life: my youth. Adulthood looks so boring if I continue to struggle making friends. It's not enough to just exist, I want to enjoy the time while I stay here, everyone does.

2) Don't give me that bullshit ""but suicide is selfish, you just pass on the pain to your family/friends/social network"", just shut the fuck up. Once I heard a good analogy for this: ""imagine you're standing on a balcony of a burning building, and someone from below screams at you to not jump. He/she does not feel the intense heat of the fire, but regardless screams that sentence. Ofcourse the man on the balcony does not want to jump and die, but he can't take the heat of the fire any longer"". The people that tell you to not suicide because then they will be sad are incredibly selfish. You would rather have someone to continue suffering immense pain, than to have yourself experience a fraction of that pain. That's evil in my eyes.
Yes, help could be coming, it can come quick or late, but do keep in mind for depression help is never coming, YOU have to seek help. I experienced it first hand. No one besides friends or famlily would reach out to you if you're hurting, you don't always have the willpower to ask for help and sometimes you feel like the 'help' won't help you. I understand people can't read minds and that they wouldnt know that u need help, but even if they knew, they rarely are willing to go through the effort of actually trying to help. They might offer to chat a bit with you, take some time out of their day. They won't take the time to go further beyond, to actually show effort by cancelling their plans to help a broken individual. Yes that's selfish of the individual, but he's about to end his own life, so I'm not sure if that's an excuse anymore. Is it that big of a price to pay to temporary cancel your plans or whatever you're doing that's important for you, to potentially save someone's life? Most people aren't willing to do that at all, thus it's beyond mad to me how they're claiming that someone 'matters' to them, especially a stranger. You supposedly matter, but you only matter if they have excess time that wouldn't affect their own livelyhood. It's ironic that people say the victim's problems are fixable, while they aren't willing to go through a temporary hard time for themselves to really help someone, which are more easily fixable issues than what the victim is facing.



Okay I'd leave it at that. I kinda lost the motivation to share any more of my perspective and I'm not sure if people would actually take the time to read through it all and respond competently besides the cliché answers. If I do get competent replies, I think I'll happily respond back.",t2_3o6j9sfh,False,,0,False,"Another suicidal person, but willing to share my view on things",[],r/depression,False,0,,0,,True,t3_h7sv4v,False,dark,1.0,,public,1,0,{},,False,[],,False,False,,{},,False,1,,False,,False,,[],{},,True,,1592023829.0,text,0,,,text,self.depression,False,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;BACKSTORY:

Sometimes I ask myself ""why am I like this?"" and I just don't understand. 
My Asian parents don't understand either..they say I never talk to them but I tried a lot of times: I told them that I can't make friends because of my social anxiety and they replied ""you're just weird and too introverted and nobody wants to be friends with you,stop embarassing us"" and when I told them I wanted to see a therapist they said ""why are you seeking attention? You don't have depression,you're just lazy and melodramatic"".
The funny thing is that I always stay alone and definitely do not seek attention,because it scares me even just to look someone into their eyes. 
I've never felt this bad,I was not like this before highschool...I had so many friends in elementary school and I was always ready to help anyone in need,I can say I was a cheerful little girl.
At the end of elementary school my parents decided to move into a bigger city to find a new job..I wasn't that sad because I was going to make new friends but I didn't know that we were going to move so many times. I had to change school multiple times and started to feel uncomfortable as the new kid..my classmates started to bully me because I was "" different "". 
I was so relieved when I started highschool but really afraid of being bullied again,surprisingly my new classmates were nice but I always isolated myself. Tbh I didn't even know how to socialize anymore and I was so sad because making friends seemed to be easy for everybody else. Luckily I found a friend in my class and because she's the only one I don't want to lose her and I always try not to be clingy. 
I pratically finished highschool: the 17 of this month I'll have to do the final exam and because of the pandemic..it will be an oral test with all the school subject+a ppt  presentation and let's be honest..I haven't started to study yet and anxiety is killing me...the main problem is one:  it's an ORAL TEST and I suffer from social anxiety,I'll probably panic and stutter,my mind can't work things out. I have mixed feelings rn and don't know what to do..this world and this life are disappointing me so much..I want to end it.

You don&amp;#39;t have depression,you&amp;#39;re just lazy and melodramatic&amp;quot;.
The funny thing is that I always stay alone and definitely do not seek attention,because it scares me even just to look someone into their eyes. 
I&amp;#39;ve never felt this bad,I was not like this before highschool...I had so many friends in elementary school and I was always ready to help anyone in need,I can say I was a cheerful little girl.
At the end of elementary school my parents decided to move into a bigger city to find a new job..I wasn&amp;#39;t that sad because I was going to make new friends but I didn&amp;#39;t know that we were going to move so many times. I had to change school multiple times and started to feel uncomfortable as the new kid..my classmates started to bully me because I was &amp;quot; different &amp;quot;. 
I was so relieved when I started highschool but really afraid of being bullied again,surprisingly my new classmates were nice but I always isolated myself. Tbh I didn&amp;#39;t even know how to socialize anymore and I was so sad because making friends seemed to be easy for everybody else. Luckily I found a friend in my class and because she&amp;#39;s the only one I don&amp;#39;t want to lose her and I always try not to be clingy. 
I pratically finished highschool: the 17 of this month I&amp;#39;ll have to do the final exam and because of the pandemic..it will be an oral test with all the school subject+a ppt  presentation and let&amp;#39;s be honest..I haven&amp;#39;t started to study yet and anxiety is killing me...the main problem is one:  it&amp;#39;s an ORAL TEST and I suffer from social anxiety,I&amp;#39;ll probably panic and stutter,my mind can&amp;#39;t work things out. I have mixed feelings rn and don&amp;#39;t know what to do..this world and this life are disappointing me so much..I want to end it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sorry for this long and confused post,I just wanted to vent out my feelings.&lt;/p&gt;

I still haven't accomplished what I want. Things got quieter/calmer, got plenty of time to meditate on the issues, but in no way got better.

--&gt; My parents needed help, so I went back at their home since a few years (multi-family home). 

They're getting old, they're alone and they're starting to have health issues. I planned my whole life to move away and fulfill my dreams in another country where my friends are, visa planned and everything.
Now I am fucked.  
Lost friends, no gf, dropped uni (medicine), no job, have no time to improve i.e. no e-learning.  
I'm doing all the chores a big farmhouse needs. Think huge land, think huge house, think not enough money to be on autopilot... as I'm not a millionaire it's hell. On top of that, there's pretty much everything to fix, from house stuff to land/lawn/tools/machinery. Add that's in the middle of nowhere.  
My time is fragmented, there's always something to do at the worst time.

I am at home, I could enjoy it but I don't feel at home. It's a weird feeling.  

So much going in my head that I lost the tranquility I'd need to start a project/online job/course and stick to it.
My brain is constantly crashing either by the long to-do lists/stuff to fix/chores or frequently clashing against my ""wannabe life"".
Every time I think about my wannabe life things just get worse as I get bad-tempered quite easily. Maybe this is why I prefer to be alone most of the time, no matter how much harder the job will be.
Hate the place, I've lost the old friends I had here as I lived elsewhere for the last 15 years. Now many either moved or have families.  
Hate the dullness/monotony of a small town in the middle of nowhere.
I have literally every object I could desire. I'm living in a beautiful house, but I am so sad you couldn't believe it. I'm doing it day by day, but I'm swearing like a sailor...
Do you know that feeling when you realize you own every object you thought you really wanted, yet you aren't enjoying it as they don't really make you happy or you aren't happy to enjoy them? Multiply it by ~1000.  

I've literally put my life on hold, for a while. I am right now not able to steer it in the direction I'd like.  

I've got no big money, no gf, no hobbies.  
My friends now are all doctors, lawyers, realtors, and such, living the high life 100k plus.  
Sometimes I hear them complaining of such small things like they were huge issues, ""first-world problems"". Fuck, they should try what I am experiencing daily. It makes me mad, and that's why I don't even reach them anymore.
  
I should leave the country and enjoy life, but I think it as too selfish now that my parents need help.
So I'm stuck in a tunnel I can't find a way out. My brain screams run away, my heart says you cannot do it. And this happens every day from the moment I wake up.  

No absolutely any kind of job opening available in quite a distant radius, now with covid is even worse than ever.
I'm doing some small jobs online just to get some money and not to completely burn my emergency fund, as I don't want to live completely off my parents' money.

But it's hard. It's mentally hard to keep track of all of this. I think I've reached the bottom of emotions, really I feel can't go any lower. 

I've been so accustomed to this situation that I am becoming emotionless. 
I'm not going out anymore as I feel I have nothing to say and I'll get bored quickly. 
You know when you talk with friends about life progress/work/marriage/kids that kind of talks...

I'm not self-harming or into drugs or anything, I discovered through these difficult times that I'm stronger than I thought. 
I kinda know that I've reached what's my lower level of emotions and I'm bouncing on it. It's a good robust support.
But it's still hard and weird when everyone in the room is happy and you are the only one not smiling. And this happens in every room...

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m not self-harming or into drugs or anything, I discovered through these difficult times that I&amp;#39;m stronger than I thought. 
I kinda know that I&amp;#39;ve reached what&amp;#39;s my lower level of emotions and I&amp;#39;m bouncing on it. It&amp;#39;s a good robust support.
But it&amp;#39;s still hard and weird when everyone in the room is happy and you are the only one not smiling. And this happens in every room...&lt;/p&gt;

Hanging out with friends

Helping people

Mindfulness

,depression,"Sorry for bad language. I am from Ukraine and used to live all my life in Russia. Earlier my skill was better, but now I have to catch up and Reddit helps me a lot with this.

So.

Now it’s almost three years I had strongest feeling like I just forgot how to live life as normal person. Three years ago my mother had stroke and whole family just rejected to help her, except me. 

Back to these days I lived in a small city in Russia — Belgorod. I had a job that I really liked, but the salary was just enough to live in this city, so my help was insignificant. Even with the financial support of my friends (about them later), I had to get into huge debts, and I still pay some of them. I didn't know then that some *close* people would be very dangerous and soon I would start receiving threats. My mistake was to give too optimistic deadlines. This continues until now, although it is easier for me to bear such episodes now.

But that's not the point, and I'll get over it sooner or later anyway. Or no. Whatever.

The point is that I have lost all control over my life after the stroke. I was often filled with anxiety for my mother and for myself. Often there was no explanation for this anxiety at all, and this made me even more afraid. I started having panic attacks. I broke up with my girlfriend and moved back to Moscow, where I tried to restart life on a more positive note. But even here there were constant problems.

A new job in the studio seemed like the job of my dreams, but I received my salary once every 4 months (I quit 8 months ago and still haven't received all the money). Since I am from Ukraine, it was a difficult task to get an official job, so I can’t do anything with situations like this. However, for the first two months, I did feel that my mental state was improving. I saw good old friends and tried not to be alone for too long. Once I even opened my *club* for reading fairy tales aloud to unknown people via Discord. I just like to read aloud, even though it didn't work out very well at first.

And then everything came back with a double. 

I've been crying in the mornings for two years now. I've lost all interest in life and I just don't know where to go. It's hard for me to get used to the fact that I don't want anything at all. Even worse, I probably wouldn’t want to. In recent weeks at my new job, I came to the office on weekends. There was no one there and I just sat all day alone, looking at the wall and thinking about how great it would be to finish everything. Just in one moment. I was out for a smoke and stare at the sharp fence below, wondering how much it would hurt to fall on it. And this thought was so commonplace and so clear that later I would feel uneasy again. I’ve learned that I don’t afraid to die anymore.

Of course, I wanted to see a therapist, but almost always there was no money for it. One day my good friend offere me MDMA as great thing (it was), so I tried without hesitation. After two years of my illness it was beautiful reminder that I can really love myself and deserve to be loved. On the next day I cried again, but the next two weeks I was in really good mood. I didn't continued taking drugs because of fear of addiction (my father died from heroin overdose and used me in my childhood to hide it from police. Long story), but at least it kept me from jumping on that fence earlier.

Right now, my life is taking place in an apartment. Not because of COVID, but because I feel so comfortable here in my room. I still cry in the mornings. I work from home 24/7 to avoid being alone with my thoughts, but sometimes I have to give myself a break — then I watch a movie or have a drink (twice a month maybe), thinking about a better life, if it works at all.

I began to distance myself from my friends. Sometimes I do not write to them for 2-3 months busy with work, and then return as if nothing had happened, but for them it was strange. They just got used to me and can't trust me the way they used to. Almost all of them are already in the past, and I can't blame them for that. That’s life, as Sinatra singed.

This post is not a cry for help, but now I feel like I have spoken something out and I feel a little better. That's good for now. I still have a little hope for better days — the days without anxiety, threats, problems with job and everything else that makes me suffer every second after I wake and before I sleep. 

In fact, I really don’t know what to do, but I learn to be optimistic step by step. To enjoy the little things. Hope we’re all will learn these things someday, because we have no reasons to be bad to each other. And what is really important — I learn now how to be a good person. It feels like I've betrayed a lot of people, and that shame is probably my biggest problem. It's hard for me to love myself, and without that love I can’t do anything right.

,depression,"Happy moments feel like heaven, sad ones feel like hell. If you dare to say something different, your ""S.O."" would be upset and make you suffer, then gaslight you. 

I want to remember how to be happy again. But I can't forget how I got raped when I was a child, how I tried to kill myself, how I started having a talk with myself daily like a crazy person, how I stopped contacting everyone around me and isolating myself. I can't forget how I lost my best friends and faced racism in this new country. 

&amp;#x200B;

You can't imagine how many times I came to this sub to write my story and just stopped. Crying feels good for a moment, then you're all alone. Every happy moment is around me, it doesn't make me feel anything at all. Family is around me, can't feel anything. Therapy didn't help and made me more insecure. ""You should take those meds""...

&amp;#x200B;

I did. I failed a lot of my subjects and had to work harder than ever. Stopped taking them and left my previous toxic relationship. Started feeling great, then got hit with the ""why are you alone here?"". I'm just carrying the insecurities and traumas from my childhood and partner. I can't solve it on my own, but I don't want anyone to cause me new ones. ""We"" got hooked into each other, then gaslighting, toxic behavior started. Now, I need to cry a lot and force myself into healing again.

&amp;#x200B;

I can't trust my family nor my friends. ""Stop feeling sad"" isn't gonna change me. I experienced how to be ugly and beautiful, to be poor and rich, to be powerless and powerful, from bad to good. I don't want to leave to understand what I could accomplish. My bright future? It's awesome, yeah. Then what? I have little info about every basic thing. I'm unable to provide myself any emotional support. I couldn't grow up in a right way. Even my father wasn't there. 

&amp;#x200B;

Crying is an endless loop. Feels good, then you start thinking, then you start crying again. Masturbating is also good, but you get addicted. You start having issues, pimples, shitty thoughts, side effects, etc. Taking meds is also good, but once you try escaping... It's a living hell. Talking to someone is also good, until they start analyzing you and treating you based on your given info or start using it against you. Doing my hobbies, hitting the gym, everything else feels good, but it's temporary. 

&amp;#x200B;

I think I lack affection and love. I lack physical touch. Even my ex wasn't near me. It was a long-distance and she cheated on me and made me feel horrible. Even the current one isn't near me, there's a travel ban. I asked her to talk to me instead of leaving me alone because she joked about ""ending the relationship"" just to tease me. What affection, if my partner can't even match any love. 

&amp;#x200B;

I can't imagine the times I gave my love to my ex, when I thought she's the one. 5 years went into the drain. I'm exhausted, what's next? Why should I keep going? Achievements feel great for a moment, then what? My therapist said I should pretend everything is okay and do what I have on the list and just not think about the future. 

&amp;#x200B;

So basically, I'm playing dumb and just ignoring my crisis. Even If I explain my whole situation, it's gonna only make me feel worse and pity about myself.

,depression,"I’ve always feared death more than anything, which made me absolutely confident that I would never commit suicide. Somehow I’ve managed to come to a place now where everything feels so numb and pointless that I simply can’t escape it. 

I’ve always had these problems but I could always manage it after enough trying. It got so much worse after I got rejected by someone I love with everything I have. It started off similar to other times, everything seeming to collapse in and me crying every day, and then slowly but surely fading away as I managed to contain myself. 

This time however she’s managed to stay in my head so much that now that every moment I’m not distracting myself with 50 things I come back to thinking about it. It’s nowhere near as strong as it used to be, although that could be because I’m now on antidepressants. It still lasts all the time and it’s been months that I’ve been feeling the same with literally no change - constant numbness and a feeling that it can’t get better.

Now yes like any couple we argue but our fights are loud and sometimes I call her names and she does the same a lot of cussing and just screaming. We live together she plays over watch and has her own friends group and I have the same two guys I’ve know for years but she changes friends group always but majority are other guys she claims some of them are gay whatever one day I had to work late and she claimed she was going to a friends house to spend the night I said sure I’ll see you in the morning or later on. Well I got home and someone like me plays negative scenarios in there head I look through her things, computer and what not and I find she has been having a relationship on the side we are still only dating but at this point have are at 5 years together and our own apartment I was in so much pain I cried all night and I was blowing her phone up of course no answer she had screenshots of the conversations she had and he gave her his address well a address I decided to go to it and there was no one. She shut her phone off and I didn’t know what to do I was frantic going nuts balling crying I just didn’t know 

Finally she showed up to work still drunk I went in and told her we need to talk she left work we went home and I told her I know what she’s been doing behind my back and she kinda just shrugs it off and it hurts because she doesn’t care we fight and then she brakes down and decides to stay with me I say ok like a dumbass.

,depression,"Hello, everyone. How are you guys doing?

I'm not so good. It's been a long long time now. Of course the last couple of months have been weirder, harder, and got me where I am currently.

Sorry if this is long. I decided to not post a lot of times  because this is not interesting at all, but I decided I should at least vent. 

Depression killed me. Not literally, sure, here I am writing all this... But I am definitely dead. Or the person I should be, at least. 

I have been dealing with depression and its correlates for more than 10 years so far, and the endgame is... I look around me and I could have been so much more. I had will. I had passions. I was good at so many thing. I still am, somewhere under all this garbage. I could write wonderfully! I was so goddamn smart. I believed in myself, at least a little bit. I wasn't so sure I am indeed a failure, but now I am. I wasn't so sure I would be sad no matter what, but now I am.
 
Time carrying this stinky, messy, loud goat called depression crushed it all. I can't do... Anything. 

I only need to write my thesis to get my degree, but I can't. I don't see why. I sit in front of my computer and I cannot write. It's been 1 year and a half, now, and every single person involved in the process is frustrated. All my colleagues moved on, they did it. I didn't. I just hate myself.

Similarly, I need to find a job. I am 26 years old and I'm currently unemployed without a single idea of what I should do. It's so difficult to grasp something I would be good doing, or would enjoy. Of course somehow it never works out for me. I don't have the confidence, or the curriculum, or the experience, or the courage to apply. I also don't seem to think anything at all would suit me or would make me happy. I look at all my friends working and I wonder ""how did they do it?"".

All the things I think could make me at least a bit happy are so, so, so unattainable and distant. 

With time I lost the will to talk to people. It's so hard to maintain a good friendship. And it's my fault.
I have no degree and it's my fault. 
I have no job and it's my fault. 
I have no pleasure and it's my fault.

I am sitting in a park and the day is so beautiful, but why can't I enjoy it? Why am I so sad and so distraught all the time? Why is it so hard to see a way out? 

And don't get me wrong. I take medication and see a therapist weekly. For years and years. That's why I am not literally dead, I guess.

I could be at least a decent, functional human being. I could. But I am not.

&lt;p&gt;Depression killed me. Not literally, sure, here I am writing all this... But I am definitely dead. Or the person I should be, at least. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have been dealing with depression and its correlates for more than 10 years so far, and the endgame is... I look around me and I could have been so much more. I had will. I had passions. I was good at so many thing. I still am, somewhere under all this garbage. I could write wonderfully! I was so goddamn smart. I believed in myself, at least a little bit. I wasn&amp;#39;t so sure I am indeed a failure, but now I am. I wasn&amp;#39;t so sure I would be sad no matter what, but now I am.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Time carrying this stinky, messy, loud goat called depression crushed it all. I can&amp;#39;t do... Anything. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I only need to write my thesis to get my degree, but I can&amp;#39;t. I don&amp;#39;t see why. I sit in front of my computer and I cannot write. It&amp;#39;s been 1 year and a half, now, and every single person involved in the process is frustrated. All my colleagues moved on, they did it. I didn&amp;#39;t. I just hate myself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Similarly, I need to find a job. I am 26 years old and I&amp;#39;m currently unemployed without a single idea of what I should do. It&amp;#39;s so difficult to grasp something I would be good doing, or would enjoy. Of course somehow it never works out for me. I don&amp;#39;t have the confidence, or the curriculum, or the experience, or the courage to apply. I also don&amp;#39;t seem to think anything at all would suit me or would make me happy. I look at all my friends working and I wonder &amp;quot;how did they do it?&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All the things I think could make me at least a bit happy are so, so, so unattainable and distant. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With time I lost the will to talk to people. It&amp;#39;s so hard to maintain a good friendship. And it&amp;#39;s my fault.
I have no degree and it&amp;#39;s my fault. 
I have no job and it&amp;#39;s my fault. 
I have no pleasure and it&amp;#39;s my fault.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am sitting in a park and the day is so beautiful, but why can&amp;#39;t I enjoy it? Why am I so sad and so distraught all the time? Why is it so hard to see a way out? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And don&amp;#39;t get me wrong. I take medication and see a therapist weekly. For years and years. That&amp;#39;s why I am not literally dead, I guess.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I could be at least a decent, functional human being. I could. But I am not. Because depression killed me.&lt;/p&gt;

I'm at a loss. I feel like nothing is worth it anymore. I feel like I am a no one and that I have nothing. That I have no one.  I have no motivation to do anything, literally. I'm barely eating and drinking water, started smoking again. I stopped working out, reading books, living healthy altogether. I've been having many suicidal thoughts - I have three different plans... It just feels so easy to get out of this mess... I lost my job, my girfriend broke up with me in March and since then, it's only been getting worse. I have no one - except for my family, who I fight with every time we see each other. So I don't have them either. I've been seening a psychologist as well but to no avail...

On the other hand, every now and then I get these bumps of motivation. I feel like I can do anything and be anyone, I'm as happy as I've ever been and just want to enjoy life. I feel like eating healthy again, working out, looking for a job and doing something with my life. And then it all fades away. In an instant. I start feeling like I might as well just die and everything will be, well, unsure whether better or worse, but at least different. And I'd really take those odds... I don't know. I am grateful for a lot of things but for me, thinking about it and repeating it out loud just changes nothing. My psychologist and everyone, really, has been saying - ""Just give yourself time, you'll get over it"". And  yeah, I'm not crying because of that breakup anymore, but now I want to die. It's been three months and it's getting worse.

It's mostly because of my girlfriend, though. We didn't officially break up, we just took a break. And we did that before, it's no different this time. Whenever things got rough. I know, it's not the best way to go, but it works for us. After every one of these breaks, it felt like it's not going anywhere again. And then it did. It's no different now, but again, it feels like I lost the love of my life and I don't know what to do... Everyone just says that she wasn't that great and I admit that there were 100 things right and 1000 things wrong about her, but that's who she is. Everyone's saying that there's other girls at least just like her, if not even better but I just can't imagine that. I can't go outside and meet people either, not this year anyway, because of what's happening.

I've tried planning my day and just working on myself but it always only works for a really short amount of time and I fall back in this thing. What should I do? I don't want to kill myself, but if I see no other option, I'll just go ahead and do that...

,depression,"Im not sure what I want to achieve by posting this but I probably want to know if other people share the same Feeling and maybe a few tips on how to handle my feelings.

Im 23 and basically I can't remember a moment where I was REAL happy. Im german so my english is not that good and its a bit harder for me to explain but ill do my best.

Basically my only feeling of happiness is ""hey its pretty cool"". 
Even as a kid when I was like 10 and my parents gave me videogame console on christmas I could not feel any real happiness (like a kid jumping around,being happy etc) it was just ""cool"". 

(Money and things doeant make anyone happy I know but thats basically stuff where most kids go crazy).

And basically this translates in every other Situation..

When I finished school with actual good grades it was just ""cool/okay"", when I found a new good job it was just ""cool"" and in a week im gonna write my final exam,ive learned 3 hours daily for the past 4 months and even if i get good grades.. I wont be super happy,its ""cool"" then.

Id describe the ""cool"" feeling as the following Situation : You found a Dollar on the street,it gives you a lil smile on the face but wont make you go crazy basically because you cant do anything with the dollar anyway.
Its like people rate their happiness from 0 to 10 but I simply cannot go over 5.

Personally im fine with feeling that way,i never went crazy because i were that happy and thats okay,so I cant miss that. But people around me are going crazy,like my girlfriend. She expects me to do a backflip whenever I see her. But I simply cannot feel THAT happy just because I see her (or any other friend). I really love her and I love to see her but I cannot simply be super happy just because we see each other.

On birthday or christmas I see myself acting happy over the presents because I do not want to dissappont anyone.

My friends are so funny and laugh together but im the boring one ajd my friends thought i was smart for some reason.

So they thought i was the too serious and smart type - until i revealed to them that that is not true

Which makes me even more sad because now they don't even know who i am

I am just nothing and boring

I can't have fun and when i do it just feels so fake and i hate being laughed at cause i probably have low self esteem.

I only pass my grades - or no that's wrong i have actually failed some but im trying. But i still dont get higher gradres than that

Ubless its something that i find interesting which is only like psychology and i get like a C on that.. Only that.

I am not funny or can have fun and yes im serious but not smart

My friends are so funny and laugh together but im the boring one ajd my friends thought i was smart for some reason.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So they thought i was the too serious and smart type - until i revealed to them that that is not true&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Which makes me even more sad because now they don&amp;#39;t even know who i am&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am just nothing and boring&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I can&amp;#39;t have fun and when i do it just feels so fake and i hate being laughed at cause i probably have low self esteem.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I only pass my grades - or no that&amp;#39;s wrong i have actually failed some but im trying. But i still dont get higher gradres than that&lt;/p&gt;

,depression,"This is my last resort because I have no one to say this to. I'm a 16 y/o female and I feel like I have so many things going for me but my joy for living has faded and I don't care about anything anymore. I was born in a third world country with verbally and sometimes physically abusive parents who fled to America to build a future for me and get me here safely. At the time of me living in another country, I was happy because I thought that everyone's lives were dull and I just had to deal with it. when I turned 11, I began to learn stuff about my past that made me realize that I had a shitty childhood and those memories were repressed (examples: grandpa and uncle were killed by a gang, grandma stole $40,000 from my life savings to try to save them which didn't work, mom was beaten and raped by her father, dad was physically/verbally abused by his entire family, etc). Once I started making friends in my school I realized it was not normal to have such a traumatic childhood and that this was the reason I never truly felt happy. Throughout middle school, I was bullied and I felt misunderstood. When high school started I became pressured to take on the hardest classes and activities because my parents and everyone told me that doing them would make me successful. While I didn't believe them, I still did them because I was basically bullied into doing them. By sophomore year of high school, I started to get severe migraines and my mom only took me to a neurologist when I started to faint because of them and being so stressed. Now that I'm a junior in high school, the amount of work I had to do throughout the day caused me to repress my feelings and not have to deal with them. I had to be at school and volunteer from 7am-7pm most days which gave me a way out of my family life and also a reason to neglect my mental health. I became super competitive with everyone and closed myself off because of the culture in my school and the pressure to get into elite colleges. When I came home from school, I would sleep from 7pm-10pm to avoid my family and wake up when they went to sleep just to do homework and go to school. I became a robot but every time I tried to tell anyone they would say ""you did this to yourself"" or they just wouldn't understand. Yes, I chose to take on the challenge, but that doesn't mean I don't deserve to get a break or to have a good support system. When school ended because of corona, I suddenly had no responsibilities so essentially two years worth of ignoring my mental health and suppressing memories came to me and now I feel more numb than ever. I recently tried to ask my mom for a therapist when quarantine is lifted, and she told me that I haven't experienced any trauma and that I should be happy to be in America. I already know I have symptoms of ADHD, depression, PTSD, and anxiety and if I were diagnosed with what I have it would help me learn how to be happy despite having those illnesses. She then refused which means that I can only get a therapist if I pay for it. My parents also want me to marry a rich man and have children just to make my future husband not leave me. Later on I realized my mom had me because her family forced her to and also so my dad would not leave her. I kinda understand them because they come from a country where the sole purpose of life is marriage and children but I don't want to live that way. I want to travel, practice medicine, and live a happy life with a significant other. I personally am not a fan of children, but my mom says they are the only reason for people to keep living. when I told my mom I want to be a surgeon, she told me to be a nurse because that is a man's job and I need to stay home to take care of my children. My family abuses me, I constantly have to do schoolwork and extracurriculars, my friends don't understand me, and I don't know what to do anymore. I don't want to die because I'm scared of what comes after but I also don't want to live. I sleep 13 hours a day just to avoid everything/everyone. People say to do what makes you happy, but I don't even know what does. Despite feeling like this I have to pretend like I'm okay in front of everyone because my parents work hard to provide a living and my friends won't understand.

,depression,"I have this friend. Everybody knows her as a resillient person. She assumes an aura of mental fortitude, and is readily open to listen to others ranting about their own problems. She is jokingly called by many of us as the psychiatrist friend. I myself have ranted to her about my problems way more than I should. When I attempted to commit suicide, she was the first person to told about my plans. Since I know about my friend's mental issues better now, I've stopped or at least tried to stop venting out to her about my problems.

I've always worried that she isn't as strong as she claims to be. That she is just hiding her own pain for the sake of others. Time and time again, I told her that she should vent out to me just like I do to her since it is only fair. Or maybe, she should talk about her feelings to her parents, or any friend whom she can be 100% honest to. However, she has said that she doesn't want to be a burden on anyone, so she never says anything about the bad things she feels.

Her willingness to help others extends even to guys in our university's anime club. Not to offend any otakus out there, but because my friend showed kindness and listened to their problems, they've grown attached to her to the point that some have fallen in love with her, causing jealousy issues within the club. Of course, this stresses her out, but she doesn't want to admit it.

I don't want to antagonize the anime club, but I have a feeling that my friend is uncomfortable with the guys there. She constantly tells me that while she is willing to listen to the guys ranting and laying their emotions bare, she doesn't trust them at all to open up about her own emotions. She fears that the guys might use her emotions against her in some way. Personally, I think she should leave the club, not necessarily because the guys are bad people, but because she needs some sort of mental clarity. None of the guys in the club know about this and are unaware of her true mental state. 

I told her as a last resort that if she doesn't want to talk to a friend or a family member, she should go to the student counselor or go to therapy. But then, she says that she doesn't want to depend on therapy to fix her problems because she is afraid that she will become dependent on it forever and never become better. I want to believe that this is not true, but I do not know how to convince her that therapy is worth it. She even mentioned that the cost of therapy might badly affect her parents since they would have to spend on her medical bills.

She has given so many excuses on why she doesn't need to seek help and I am at a loss on how to help her. I can't even imagine what she went through in her childhood that made her this emotionally closed off from everyone. It hurts me and I want to help her somehow.

I've scared my coworkers at work lately, specially today. This madness has made me able to switch my personality quick. Too quick perhaps. I was angry with my supervisor, then my coworker came in and just saw me switch to happiness, right before their eyes. They knew I only had 4 hours of sleep the night before, so they got on my ass for it. 
The thing is I know this is not healthy. I been bottleing my emotions in for 7 years. I've attempted many times, had people lie to me and leave, or the people who stay, i push them away. I been wanting to open up to one of my coworker which I consider my best friend. I am not sure if he feels the same.
He asked me today if I have gone to a doctor recently, since he noticed I have an extreme insomnia. I havent. I did not have the courage to tell him that I know if I go, they might want to keep me over night for survailence. I hurt myself mentally and physically. 
Plus he has his own shit to deal with. I dont want to be another burden. Everytime I am aboout to open up to someone, I see my self as a burden, or a party pooper, or an attention whore. 
I'm stressed, that has been the story of my life for the past years, but this feels different. Its a mixture of guilt, anger, dissapointment and a heavy pressure on my chest. Heavy pressure is a new thing though. Odly enough, a small part of me enjoys it. The other part is like ""yup, time for Game Over"". 

I cant even say kill myself, self harm or starve myself without any shame. I am a manager at a good job. I have everything in my palms when asked. I am in the process of getting my own house.

I dont want pity either. I just want a friend IRL who will stop me. The last one promised me that she will stop self harm if i stopped. Of course she broke her promise.

,depression,"I was sad and angry the other day over something that happened in the past, but I wasn’t acting on it. I asked my mom to casually invite her friend over because she’s such a nice person I felt like hanging out with her. My mom noticed that I was down and without telling me, took the liberty of telling her “come over now because she is sad”. So she felt compelled to come, and worse yet, kept asking me “what’s wrong?”  over and over again, to the point where I was feeling visibly uncomfortable. Then she said “pull yourself together” which I know she did from the goodness of the heart, but I didn’t like it regardless. I didn’t say anything although I wanted to reply “I don’t need to. I wasn’t plastered all over the place to begin with” so bad. Then my mom started assuming untrue things about me out loud, speaking with a third-person narrative, as if I wasn’t there hearing it all. I got angry and yelled at her and bad-mouthed her because at that point I had had enough. I didn’t do it on purpose. I just really lost it. I can be rude when I’m angry. Now I hate myself and I don’t want to see my mom’s friend again because I’m absolutely mortified.

It’s just, so many times, people go out of their ways to “help” me it only makes the matters worse, and once it backfires, I’m the bad guy again.

I hate having to hear that “Life is great!” and that “Everything has a solution” and “Be happy! Smile! Move on” or that I need to stop being “so negative”. I’d rather hear that life is hard and it’s ok to not feel ok all the time.

Anyway, just wanted to rant and chill because it was eating me and I couldn’t tell anybody.

I don't know if this is the right place to post this story, but here it goes.
I (22M) had a difficult time growing up since I got cancer when I was about 14 years old.
I got pretty shy and really didn't care about anything at the time, my parents were always super protective, rarely leetting me go out to parties, etc.
I didn't care at first, but time goes by and today I see myself with apathetic with no emotions, no will to live.

I'm going to a psychiatrist for about 1 year, taking my meds for depression, anxiety (plus the pills I take for cancer).

Currently I work in a good place, go to college of engineering, have friends, play guitar, games, etc.
But none of this ""fills the gap for happiness"".

,depression,"It got real bad. My lowest point for sure. Never felt more alone, and isolated. Started thinking of all the ways I could end it. I was just over it. Out of nowhere, a friend messaged me. I ended up telling him about feeling suicidal. He revealed he went through a similar thought pattern in the past as well, and pointed me in the direction of a crisis line to call. He made me promise him to exhaust all my options first before continuing on with my current thoughts. 

I finally gathered up the courage to call, never cried more in my life. I felt bad for the social worker who assessed me, as she had the difficult task of making out what I was trying to say through my heavy sobs. Cried for basically the entire assessment. She deemed my case to be urgent, and got me booked with a psychiatrist the next day. And also referred me to a suicide prevention counselling clinic place called the SAFER program. 

First time speaking to a psychiatrist, was so nervous he wasn’t going to be nice for some reason. He turned out to be nice, to my relief. Told me I had a depressive disorder. So basically depression. Prescribed me two types antidepressants. One of them is primarily for treating my insomnia that I’ve developed over the years. 

Actually, before the appointment with the psychiatrist, I got a call from SAFER who also booked my first therapy session with a counsellor. Then proceeded to cry some more during the psychiatrist appointment. Who also was super concerned about my case. 

Spoke with the counsellor from SAFER for the first therapy session a few days ago, went great. Still cried, but not nearly as much as during the assessment with the social worker. I’m supposed to keep going with therapy now for once a week. For the foreseeable future. 

Even just talking to these 3 different people really helped make me feel just a little bit lighter. I think the meds are also starting to do it’s thing. I don’t feel the urge as strongly, but they’re definitely still there. I still have thoughts like, you know, I could just end if now but running in front of a speeding car. Or jumping in front of a train. And then it’ll all be over.

But for now, I’m hanging on. For now. I’ve been telling myself to sleep on it. Every time I have a suicidal thought, sleep on it. Let’s see if I still feel as strong about it still the next day. And usually that urge or thought feels less intense.

It's gotten a lot worse recently because my puppy that we had for over 10 years just passed away. It happened very suddenly, so we didn't get the chance to make her last days special. I've been feeling a lot of guilt, just wishing that I would have made her life better overall, especially these last few months that I didn't even know were her last.

I feel a lot of guilt about a lot of things. I never know how to forgive myself for the mistakes I've made or the things I thought I should have done better. I live too much in the past, and then feel more guilt about not doing more in the present. It's a vicious cycle and I have no idea how to end it. I don't know how to be happy anymore, just how to distract myself from feeling sad *all* the time, but I guess I can't escape my problems in my dreams anymore.

I'm not sure how to take the world off my own shoulders. I've had the attitude that I needed to be there for others, yet put myself on the back-burner my whole life. I think it started by listening to my mom gripe about my dad and trying to tell her everything would be okay and never telling her how sad it made me that their marriage was so loveless. This was my whole childhood, and it still goes on (if you're wondering why no divorce, my mom told me she'd consider it if only we had enough money to afford one).

I don't know how to care about me. I'm starting to not even have the strength to care for others. It all seems so exhausting. I choose to be numb sometimes instead of worrying about others' problems now (and certainly instead of worrying about my own).

Is there anyway to break this cycle? How do you forgive yourself for your past mistakes?

,depression,"I thought I should record this here in the hopes it might help someone else.

I'm 45 and have dealt with depression for decades.  I've had adverse reactions to every medication I've tried, and spent 20 years trying to numb everything away with alcohol.  I'm nine days away from two years of sobriety.  

I'm single, never married, never had kids.  I've had a few relationships but they just didn't last.  I'm not an easy person to live with, and at 45 the idea of a relationship exhausts me.  My last romantic relationship was twelve years ago.

I should exercise more.  I'm overweight and out of shape.  It's just not worth it to get healthier.  Honestly, why?  For who?  I have no desire to live longer than I need to.

I don't think I'm ugly but there's clearly something about me that is either unattractive or registers as 'off' about me.  It sucks.  I'm used to it.

I have a good job.  I have a home that's larger than I need.  My bills are paid.  There's food in my cabinets.  By all accounts I should be happy, or at least content.

Yet I break down every damn day.  More than a few times each day.  I get overwhelmed and the lonliness and despair sinks me low.  I struggle to put it aside, but I do, and then I keep moving on.

Some days I marvel at how much time has passed and how long I've hung on.  I wish I could see it as some sort of super power but it's not noble or brave.  It's just weird and pathetic. 

In my teens I decided that I wasn't going to check out mainly because it would have destroyed my mom.  I decided to wait until both she and my dad passed and then quietly slip away.

My mom is now in hospice and my dad is a wreck.  I don't really feel anything except maybe a sense of relief.  Once she passes away it'll just be my dad left.

Once he goes I'll pick up the bottle again.


I'm sure it'll be fairly quick and I'll finally find some peace.

So, we have a family friend who we'll call Dave. Dave has been living at our house for almost a year, he's been friends with my dad since they were in their 20's. It was cool, we would play guitar everyday, split a six pack every now and then and just hang out. He became one of my closest friends, despite him being 52 and me being 20. A few months ago him and my dad got into an argument, (Dave accused my dad of stealing from him and said he's a loser for being unemployed) but everyone was in between them including my little sister so it didn't end in a fight. Before he walked away he promised my dad that he would kick his ass.

Seeing that upset me and Dave even told me he was sorry and that he wouldn't hurt my dad. I told him it was okay and then cried myself to sleep. Dave started staying with my uncle who turned the garage into a little house so Dave didn't leave, I would hang out with him sometimes but not as much as before. He said he missed being with us, I said I wished things would just go back to normal and about a week later they did. Dave and my dad put things behind them and everything was cool.

I'm gonna speed through this part.
A week ago Dave moves into a motel for unrelated reasons and starts doing lots of meth. My parents borrow some money from him to buy groceries and stuff. Days later Dave sends my mom an email saying he wants to take her out and buy her any clothes she wants and take her out to any restaurant she wants, he says there's another way for her to repay the money but he has to tell her in person and if she agrees it had to be done right then and there. My dad obviously thinks this is weird.

Last night, Dave sends my mom a text saying he wants to talk to her and ""keep a promise"" with my dad. We all knew what that meant but when he showed up to the house we tried to keep things chill since nothing was stated outright. He asks my mom to talk and my dad walks with them, Dave says it's a private conversation and my dad says ""why do you need to have a private convo with my wife?""

Dave gets aggressive and says ""if you have a problem do something about it."" My dad tells him to relax and I hear a punch connect (I was standing around a corner listening). Mom starts yelling at Dave to stop and I see him holding my dad and punching him, adrenaline kicks in and I jump on Dave's back and start choking him and somehow manage to throw him into the front yard. We're all yelling at him to leave but he rushes my dad and again I start choking him, he lands a few elbows to my ribs which pisses my mom off and she jumps in, which only succeeds in getting herself punched in the face. I snapped and threw Dave down again and my dad beat the crap out of him. The cops were called and Dave was arrested since he started everything. 

I know that I was just protecting my family and I'll fight anyone who hits my mom but I can't shake this terrible guilt inside me. Why do I feel so shitty? That was obviously his intention when he came over, so why do I feel like I did something wrong? Why do I want to apologize when he attacked us? Why do I want to ask my parents to drop the charges?

,depression,"It's getting bad. Before covid I was seeing a therapist and even after we did video sessions but it didnt feel the same so I stopped. I think I have some attachment issues from past trauma.

I recently moved to a new town for work and my ex left me shortly thereafter because I'm a shitty human. I have very few friends and no family in the area. Work is the only thing I enjoy that keeps me going, but it's also a high stress job. I have ""work friends"" but nothing ever more seems to materialize when I tried hanging out outside of work. I used to talk to a few people from work because you know I'm lonely as fuck and I'd like friends but I feel like I just bother them and sometimes I get left on read so I just stopped and just keep everything business only at work. Recently I deleted social media because I didn't want to see posts from people hanging out and generally enjoying life without me. But now I'm just a lonely fuck who doesnt talk to anyone. 

I'm on antidepressants but days like today make me question what the point of it all is. I'd love to be comfortable in my own company but I'm not. I'm not sure I can change how I'm wired because we develop most of that in our young years. I tried to adjust from trying to ""Fix"" myself to ""living with it"" but I mean this sucks.

Before covid I was seeing a therapist and even after we did video sessions but it didnt feel the same so I stopped. I think I have some attachment issues from past trauma.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I recently moved to a new town for work and my ex left me shortly thereafter because I&amp;#39;m a shitty human. I have very few friends and no family in the area. Work is the only thing I enjoy that keeps me going, but it&amp;#39;s also a high stress job. I have &amp;quot;work friends&amp;quot; but nothing ever more seems to materialize when I tried hanging out outside of work. I used to talk to a few people from work because you know I&amp;#39;m lonely as fuck and I&amp;#39;d like friends but I feel like I just bother them and sometimes I get left on read so I just stopped and just keep everything business only at work. Recently I deleted social media because I didn&amp;#39;t want to see posts from people hanging out and generally enjoying life without me. But now I&amp;#39;m just a lonely fuck who doesnt talk to anyone. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m on antidepressants but days like today make me question what the point of it all is. I&amp;#39;d love to be comfortable in my own company but I&amp;#39;m not. I&amp;#39;m not sure I can change how I&amp;#39;m wired because we develop most of that in our young years. I tried to adjust from trying to &amp;quot;Fix&amp;quot; myself to &amp;quot;living with it&amp;quot; but I mean this sucks. I generally feel defective and unlikable. &lt;/p&gt;

,depression,"I took Abilify for about 4 months and never took more than 10mg a day. I never gained much weight and had none of the side effects except I lost the ability to focus and multitasking overwhelmed me. My anxiety shot thru the roof, but all of this could be attributed to being forced to stay home with my wife and two young children, while balancing a stressful work life during this pandemic. My area is finally entering phase 2 today, so I'm hopeful my mood will shift, but my psychologist decided to switch up my meds yesterday.

my boyfriend and I have been together for 7,5 years. During this time he has had some bad weeks and 3 very dark depression episodes while with me.

When he was 15 he was diagnosed with depressive episodes in combination with add. After this help he didn’t receive any more help in form of therapy and medication. 

I myself do not have depression (i do have anxiety and can relate to some extent) and have been trying to be as supportive as I can be. 

So this is where my question comes in: On three seperate occasions he has had bad dark depression episodes. In all of these occasions a very stressful thing was happening in his life. And in all of these occasions he turned on me and became very negative about me and our relationship; didn’t see any hope and was on the brink of breaking up. 
After his stress gets resolved, he is able to climb out of the dark spell and feels completely different about the relationship.

Right now we are on spell nr 3, and it’s a very bad one. Once again; i am the culprit of all evil. (Note; he never gets agressive or condescending or anything, just doesn’t see anything good about me or the relationship). This time round we have just gotten the news that after 1,5 years of looking our offer on a house has been accepted and in 2 months we move in. I think this is where the stress comes from.

What i want to know is if anyone has experienced something like that? He only does it to me and focusses his negativity on me. 

This is the third time now, and i’m just emotionally exhausted from being in the dark on my relationship, especially when we sign a contract in 2 months.. i made him talk to his parents (yes, even when he’s a grown ass man) and made him call his gp to schedule and appointment with a psychologist for the first time in 12 years. I’ve been nothing but understanding because i know he doesn’t do it on purpose.

What else can i do ? He pulls away from me. And do you think that his depression causes his doubts, or that his doubts seem to come out when he gets depressed?

I’m at a loss and want to help him (whilst also being heartbroken myself- for the third time..) i need to know if i’m being toyed around. He himself can’t tell me, he can’t see clearly right now.

,depression,"Their are 2 kinds of depression, a clinical one which you have no control over which is a chemical imbalance but is rare. The other is a self inflicted one, trust me when i say that your mind is trying to get you out of working hard and developing yourself which is otherwise known as depression as most know it today. What I'm saying is just fact but you won't believe me because you just have to experience these things and figure it out for yourself, sooner rather then later i hope.

Another thing i have found is that the generic “talk to someone” response you hear about online is what you %100 must do (with someone you trust most. srs if you dont want to talk to a parent then fucking dont, just someone you trust. A doctor is a good last resort if you have nobody which is also just fine)

When i was a little younger i didn't understand why but now i see that i was so naive (which is natural ofc) and their actually was a big problem in my life that i wasn't adressing.
It's sad because i personally missed out on a lot, not because of others even though i had every reason to blame them. It's actually because i was too weak to bite the bullet and do the emotionally difficult thing and seek help but rather hoping someone would come save me. But that isn't how life works for most people buttttt at the same time i am glad i have experienced all this and can take the knowledge I've gained and boss in life at just 21. Fuck yea baby
P.s It's weird because most people younger then me don't give a shit about what I've just said because they can't possibly understand it quite yet. But i guess i can't understand what a 40 year old has to say about their experiences so I'm just as naive 🤷‍♂️ such is life right

I really do feel as though i understand your depression almost completely but you wont think i do because I'm not in your shoes which i get. BUT you must understand that you're only on here reading this in the first place because it's comfortable for you to do so rather thet bite the fucking bullet as previously mentioned.

Really really think about this, their are people that are 100x worse off then you but are happy as fuck. Isn't it just obvious that you can be just as happy?

,depression,"Today my wife is leaving. Not because we don’t love each other, not because of arguments, not because of any tangible reason. She has been extremely depressed for a while now. 

We both moved to Texas 12 months ago, completely away from all friends and family, for work. And it has been a long and depressing year. Being away from her loved ones has effected her so much more than we could have imagined. So today she is leaving to go back home and heal. Her mom and brother are landing at the airport now to help her drive back to Washington. 

This isn’t a goodbye, it’s the start of a new chapter that will include much needed healing so we can move on from here and be so much happier together. But there is no time frame, obviously we don’t know how long she’s gonna need. I really am truly proud of her for doing this and In no way do I actually not want her to go. 

But the thought of being alone in our house all day, with literally zero friends or family that even live in this state is absolutely killing me. I’m terrified. I’m so scared of everything right now. I love her more than anything in this world, and I know she loves me just as much. But I can’t help being extremely scared right now. I have cried more today than I think I have the last 10 years combined. 

It probably sounds selfish, but I’m so scared she’s gonna go back home and become complacent. That she isn’t going to want to come back. I’m trembling at the thought of this morning being the last time I get to wake up beside her in bed. 

She is my best friend and I just don’t know what to do without her. And I will admit that is part of the healing process and part of the problem we face. We rely on each other for literally everything. It’s not healthy to have to think of another person before you make any kind of decision about whatever it may be. 

I truly do from the bottom of my heart know that we can get better. We can better ourselves and in turn better our relationship. Neither of us want this to be the end, not even close. We’ve both done soooo much good for each other. But nonetheless I can’t help but be scared and feel like I’m stuck in a pit that I can’t get out of.

I can’t eat even though I’m hungry, I can’t find joy in anything around the house because I want to be able to enjoy it with her.

Also I’m an ungrateful, self-disliking, lazy, terrible person being a crybaby and throwing a tantrum about why I can’t always do what I want. Urgh, whatever.* 

I didn’t read it.

I just broke down, cried, hid the letter, tore up a piece of tissue paper pretending that it was the letter but it wasn’t so that I could stop crying more. The symbolism kinda worked.

I know it was nice because it was from a church acquaintance (let’s call her Riley). I used to go to a church group with Riley and other people with my age (I’m 19). We’d go to church together, listen to the Pastor saying God loves us or some shit, then we’d hang out until night to eat dinner together. Dilly-dally, talk and walk for a little bit. Maybe talk about the bible sometimes but not all the time. She was in that friendly church group, someplace where there isn’t really judgement. A place where everyone in it was assumed to be a friend.

I low-key quit that group because I thought a very close friend (let’s call her Sandy) had left me behind a few months back. Because I didn’t see Sandy for months and she wasn’t responding at all to much of my texts (which weren’t a lot tbh); even though that was our only mode of communication. So by association, I couldn’t trust surface-level friends either. The friendship were tiring and slow to grow and maintain. So I didn’t trust that group who called me a friend for no reason other than the fact I just happened to be there. Why should I? I couldn’t hang out with them on any other day other than church days. I bet most of them wouldn’t miss me, heck I wouldn’t, I don’t expect them to and I don’t want them to.

Then, Sandy and I made up. She was just going her own emotional problem stuff and was shutting out the world. She wasn’t telling me. I understand why, I’m in her place now. I’m just embarrassed by myself and my feelings and I don’t want her to know.

By then, it was assumed that I had already left the group, so I still didn’t go back to it. Why bother? Nothing fucking matters. Did I mention that I’m a bit of a nihilist so that I can build a wall of apathy around me and have nothing hurt me anymore? Sometimes it works and sometimes it doesn’t. It does succeed into making me look like an inconsiderate asshole sometimes tho! :D

Fuck.

Then Riley sent the letter to likely check up on me, in a more meaningful way than a text.

I don’t know why she cares. No one should be caring about me.

I understand why my family cares about me, they’re family and I show that I (sometimes) care about them. Also make them laugh sometimes.

I understand why Sandy and my second best friend care about me, they’re like my sworn family, the sisters I never had.

I understand why over the years, my past teachers and school-counsellor cared about me. It’s their job.

But I don’t understand Riley and her letter, this show of caring. I don’t get it. I don’t want it.  
 

No one should be caring about me I don’t deserve any of that.

It triggered some hurt for some reason, maybe it’s the self-loathing.

I wish I gave her a wrong address.

,depression,"I'm not going to try again, but nobody I know truly gets it. I doubt even you guys do

Sure, I used to lurk here years ago and see myself in most of the posts, but since then I have gotten formally diagnosed with depression and sought professional help with aid from my parents ~~because I was too pathetic to do any of the heavy work myself at that point in time.~~ I worked on finishing 2 full meals a day so I could gain weight, went out for walks, had school and library visits to look forward to, started medication, stopped lurking on subs like these, leaned on my dad when times got rough, found an unexpected joy in cooking, and combated my perpetual exhaustion by napping as often as possible. (Unfortunately, I learned the exhaustion's usually spiritual.)

The past two years have been very good for me and 2020 was going to be even better.

Pre-April, I was burying myself in my interests while on track to high school graduation (albeit a late one) and I was working out 5 days out of 7. Now? I've been languishing because I've been stuck *for ages* in the exact type of situation my therapist warned me to avoid. With no school to structure my schedule around after they were all shut down, or friends I can bring myself to physically hang out with given the circumstances, or access to gyms or therapy even before everything went to shit, and plenty of assaults and rioting in my home country I've regressed to a bitter shell of my best self.

I have veganism forcing me up in the mornings and current events here have pushed me to stop being so shy about activism in general (especially when it comes to the police brutality plaguing the country) so I'm going to be attending a protest set in two days from now if I can find a friend to bring, but beyond that my life and routine are stuck in limbo.

I didn't do it for the uncomfortable and empty reach-outs and platitudes I ended up getting. I did it because it hurts to exist when I've had a taste of how great life can be.

I doubt even you guys do&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sure, I used to lurk here years ago and see myself in most of the posts, but since then I have gotten formally diagnosed with depression and sought professional help with aid from my parents &lt;del&gt;because I was too pathetic to do any of the heavy work myself at that point in time.&lt;/del&gt; I worked on finishing 2 full meals a day so I could gain weight, went out for walks, had school and library visits to look forward to, started medication, stopped lurking on subs like these, leaned on my dad when times got rough, found an unexpected joy in cooking, and combated my perpetual exhaustion by napping as often as possible. (Unfortunately, I learned the exhaustion&amp;#39;s usually spiritual.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The past two years have been very good for me and 2020 was going to be even better.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pre-April, I was burying myself in my interests while on track to high school graduation (albeit a late one) and I was working out 5 days out of 7. Now? I&amp;#39;ve been languishing because I&amp;#39;ve been stuck &lt;em&gt;for ages&lt;/em&gt; in the exact type of situation my therapist warned me to avoid. With no school to structure my schedule around after they were all shut down, or friends I can bring myself to physically hang out with given the circumstances, or access to gyms or therapy even before everything went to shit, and plenty of assaults and rioting in my home country I&amp;#39;ve regressed to a bitter shell of my best self.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have veganism forcing me up in the mornings and current events here have pushed me to stop being so shy about activism in general (especially when it comes to the police brutality plaguing the country) so I&amp;#39;m going to be attending a protest set in two days from now if I can find a friend to bring, but beyond that my life and routine are stuck in limbo.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I didn&amp;#39;t do it for the uncomfortable and empty reach-outs and platitudes I ended up getting. I did it because it hurts to exist when I&amp;#39;ve had a taste of how great life can be.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#39;t need advice, I just needed to get this off my chest. Thank you for reading :)&lt;/p&gt;

For all of you, us. I’ve lived a lifetime in my castle, and sometimes it is only moments. 

It’s a place too many of us in 
r/depression 
and 
r/alone 
know too well. 

The stories I could tell. 

The hotlines are good, or the one I’ve called (RAINN) is. In moments of desperation, it is... not sure how to complete that sentence. Do you?

I’m here people, with you. I can tell you I get it, but the reality is that my moment is mine, and your moment is yours. They are different but the same. 

“Castle” is an adaptation from the “Queen’s castle”, which I wrote for another. 

This I piece together from us. Therefore it is for you, for me. From all I read here, from a lifetime in my castle. 

The riddle doesn’t have to be about the meaning of life. There are so many doors into the room, but once inside the room there seems to be no way out. 

I can only tell you what I’ve learned over time. I have learned that life is worth living, but the only way to find out is to live. The first step to living is choosing to live. We have lost to many. Stay with us, please. 

The philosopher who had the biggest impact on me in my life is David Foster Wallace. He wrote a short book titled, “This is water.” He doesn’t tell us the answer to the riddle. He tells us that we get to choose how we think. He told us this from experience, because he too had a Castle.

i understand why people ignore me most of the time. im a socially awkward, anxious loser. im the background character of background characters. any passion or potential of skill i have is ruined by a lack of motivation or will to go on. no matter how many times i try putting myself out there (which trust me, i have) it wont change the fact i have a lots of social skills that i need to obtain and a plethora of things to build on if i want an easier time making friends. 

but why the fuck do people leave me? ive had several friends in the past few years where they'll tell me im different from others they know, that im one of the best thing to happen to them, and that im just amazing, but then go on to randomly cut me off. these people i always truly think are friends, they show me love, initiate plenty of the conversations, listen to my vents or problems, etc. but out of the blue---its always out of the blue---they just kick me out of the door.

this makes me wonder if im the toxic person. ive spent hours and hours reading on what makes someone toxic or abusive. however, the issue is i just cant really apply anything to myself---thats no matter how hard i self evaluate and reread over old messages to see if i can catch me doing some of the behaviors mentioned. it just doesn't make sense to me unless theres stuff im not catching, which i guess would make sense as most toxic people dont really know they are.

,depression,"Hey, am a 16 yearold guy and I'm lost.

To save peoples time from reading everything I wrote, just... what is this empty feeling, where no matter what you do, you just dont feel happy.. as if you're empty or plain, things you loved doing simply doesn't work. Drowning myself in friends and distractions dont work either, I'm confused school never taught me about this or depression,.

If anyone can help, please, I'll accept anything.

I can write a background story if it makes more sense, or needed... but I've never felt this way, it's terrible fuck..

I feel nothing, nothing is enjoyable to me anymore.

Friends, girlfriend, games, hobbies, usual activities ALL of that is meaningless to me. I dont care anymore this world is just... not enjoyable.


See I dont think of suicide or self harm, I dont even feel sad I just simply no longer feel like life is enjoyable.

I sit and watch my friends have a good time, my family spending time together and smiling, over things that are funny or sweet... but to me, its meaningless.

Do I have depression, what is this feeling of eternal emptiness, I cant stay angry at anyone.. my own girlfriend broke up with me for her old ex because I wasn't the same, and she later told me she cheated with me with a guy who I had doubts about a few months prior... and in that moment I was okay, I didnt care...

I didnt feel sad, or angry... just plain.



If I could describe this feeling, it's a flat feeling.. of boredom, nothing is able to fill it, I've tried everything at this point.. I pretended to like these girls I knew, messed around with plenty of them, and even resorted to using several heavy drugs in HOPE that maybe I'd kickstart my emotions in order...

No, they did nothing, the drugs my parents were addicted that made them soooo happy, did nothing for me.. no matter how much I took of them, or how shitty I felt when I had to come down and stop.
(For note, I'm not addicted, I dont care about drugs, they didn't work)


I've never went to the doctor's for depression simply because it's been going on for so long that I just blocked it away, no body would ever think I had depression.. I cant tell them.. how would I? The guy everyone comes to when they feel as if they hit rock bottom, that they ""fucked""up for good, no...


Man it was so easy to laugh and pretend I had fun, fuck.. I loved seeing my friends laugh and smile, they were experiencing something I wish I could feel, I wish I could be the kid from grade 9 who only watched anime and jacked off for enjoyment, yet now all I do is sit and listen to music to fend off the feeling if boredom and the quietness.

My grades haven't dropped, I've maintained my 80s-85avg in school, nothing about me is struggling.. it could be my parents who are addicts that are hurting me, but I just dont feel like it is, I'm not sure what the fuck this is.. and I cant go to any of my friends or family for support, I live in a life of lies to protect the ones I cared about.. that's the one thing 






I'm sorry, I dont want to waste anyone's time with a long message, honestly man.... I wish other people never felt this feeling, I hope all of you can overcome it because holy shit it hurts man, it hurts so much to lie everyday to my friends and family and pretend as if everything is fine just to make sure they're okay, to lie to break off close relationships so that my friends are fine, I never want to be a burden, I've always been the guy everyone went to for advice, my smile... laughs, I was such a weird funny guy, always doing stupid shit that sacrificed my own reputation JUST to make my classmates laugh, I liked helping others.",t2_6eapi1dm,False,,0,False,"I'm lost, what am I doing...",[],r/depression,False,0,,0,,False,t3_h7ijvv,False,dark,0.67,,public,1,0,{},,False,[],,False,False,,{},,False,1,,False,,False,,[],{},,True,,1591988072.0,text,0,,,text,self.depression,False,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hey, am a 16 yearold guy and I&amp;#39;m lost.&lt;/p&gt;

I was always so lonely just seeing people hangout with their friends and living life on social media. I will never know how that feels like and it was hard for me to make friends because I just didn't connect with people a whole lot. The only time I would socialize was during school and I would always be home. Making friends out of college is hard and I don't understand why! I do my best to always find hope and I always end up losing it cuz everytime I meet someone great I would be the only one initiating the conversation. I'm not a mean person and I do my best to listen to people. Most of my friendships was always a one way thing where I would always ask to hang and it just hurts because I question what is wrong with me? My close friend in middle school would always be on her phone texting people but would take hours replying to me I feel like I should not live because this has always been a constant thing even during college.

,depression," Hi I am 39 years old I am tired of living through life like this I'm on disability the unable to work because of PTSD severe chronic depression severe social anxiety which makes working nearly impossible to be around others and just to be able to try to do a job I also have dyslexia and learning issues which make working even harder especially if it's something I've never done before. Companies don’t want someone who is really slow at trying to learn and who has no education.

I have a tooth that needs to be recrowned and its the #19 tooth, I had the #30 tooth same spot on the right side removed and if I get #19 removed, I won't be able to chew as it is the only tooth I have I can really chomp down on food and yet I can't afford the $1200 for a new crown on it so I have no option but to get it removed for $400 

I have spent show years trying to get my GED, and I have spent many years trying to get a job my own place a vehicle and a good woman to love me. I have lost my parents when I was in my early twenties I only knew my dad for a few months before he passed away when I was 23, when I was 25 I lost my mother I don't know if it was from suicide or if it was from health issues.

I have no family no friends, what can we do have they don't want anything to do with me or I don't want anything to do with them because of how toxic they are to me. I have spent many years homeless and have been through a lot of stuff and seeing things nobody should see. I am currently renting a room from a sixty-year-old woman and if she dies I will end up back on the streets.

I have been trying to find a place to live I've been called up for several apartments low income, but every time it comes time for me to take one something comes up that keeps me from being able to get into one. I bought a car a few years ago and got scammed out of $2,000 to USD. I've been trying to save for another car but every time I do something comes up that takes my savings  or pushes me further in debt.

For the past 10 years I have applied for jobs never had an interview, I have spent trying to get my GED  and have been unable to. I've had tutors I've had teachers,  I have had study groups and one-on-one sessions. but even with all of this I have not been able to get my GED my education is on a second and third-grade level in almost every subject and I have to learn from 2nd grade to 12th grade I can't do that.

I spend my time watching movies, TV shows, listening to music, I don't even have a game system so I can't even play video games which I actually used to enjoy doing. It's been years since I've played a video game I can't afford the consoles or the games. and the computer I have is not strong enough to be able to hold video games or to be able to handle playing video games.

I used to enjoy fishing camping used to enjoy archery, I even used to go bowling every other Friday night which I can't do anymore either. I even used to love going to the golf courses and hitting up the golf ranges and just shooting a bucket of golf balls I found it peaceful and relaxing but I can't even afford that. 

I have done many things for work which was cash under the table and it was all manual labor. I have done everything from fixing fences building concrete slabs building porches building staircases as well as building walls and fixing holes in the walls even putting in new flooring or replacing flooring. I have done many other things as well as boxing for a few months I drove a semi-truck for a few months but my anxiety gets so bad to the point I could even drive them anymore. I can't do the work I used to do because of arthritis in my lower back and rheumatoid arthritis in my knees and feet.

I consider myself weird and nerdy by I consider myself a homebody but I do like going out time to time that prefers to stay home. I have put myself out there in the dating scene for over 8 years, during those eight years I've had women catfish me pretending to want to be with me, leading me on as they loved me. then they would fake their death on me or they would just ghost me. I have had women telling me I was a joke worthless useless had nothing to offer a relationship and I shouldn't even be loved and no one would want to be with me.

I have been trying to build myself a life and been trying to get on my feet but every time I do things come up that keep me down and knock me back down and I just can't keep doing it anymore. it feels like every breath I take is just razors cutting through my lungs attracting me apart inside. I am tired of struggling to breathe. I am tired of trying to fight to build something out of my life. I am tired of spending every waking moment of my life alone single unloved unwanted.

All I wanted was to find a woman to love me and accept me and treat me right. I don't ask for much just a simple life, all I want is just one or two friends a nice woman my own apartment and a vehicle that's it. but it feels like I'm trying to reach to live on Pluto and it's like it's trying to ask for a billion dollars and to become the president of the whole world.

I am tired I am worn out I am exhausted I have nothing left in me to give nothing left in me to fight I can't do it by myself anymore alone no support no one helping me constantly fighting and fighting and getting nowhere except right where I was when I started to try to fight to build something I can't do it anymore so today when a woman that I rent bedroom from leaves I will end up ending my life.

I am currently renting a room from a sixty-year-old woman and if she dies I will end up back on the streets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have been trying to find a place to live I&amp;#39;ve been called up for several apartments low income, but every time it comes time for me to take one something comes up that keeps me from being able to get into one. I bought a car a few years ago and got scammed out of $2,000 to USD. I&amp;#39;ve been trying to save for another car but every time I do something comes up that takes my savings  or pushes me further in debt.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the past 10 years I have applied for jobs never had an interview, I have spent trying to get my GED  and have been unable to. I&amp;#39;ve had tutors I&amp;#39;ve had teachers,  I have had study groups and one-on-one sessions. but even with all of this I have not been able to get my GED my education is on a second and third-grade level in almost every subject and I have to learn from 2nd grade to 12th grade I can&amp;#39;t do that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I spend my time watching movies, TV shows, listening to music, I don&amp;#39;t even have a game system so I can&amp;#39;t even play video games which I actually used to enjoy doing. It&amp;#39;s been years since I&amp;#39;ve played a video game I can&amp;#39;t afford the consoles or the games. and the computer I have is not strong enough to be able to hold video games or to be able to handle playing video games.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I used to enjoy fishing camping used to enjoy archery, I even used to go bowling every other Friday night which I can&amp;#39;t do anymore either. I even used to love going to the golf courses and hitting up the golf ranges and just shooting a bucket of golf balls I found it peaceful and relaxing but I can&amp;#39;t even afford that. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have done many things for work which was cash under the table and it was all manual labor. I have done everything from fixing fences building concrete slabs building porches building staircases as well as building walls and fixing holes in the walls even putting in new flooring or replacing flooring. I have done many other things as well as boxing for a few months I drove a semi-truck for a few months but my anxiety gets so bad to the point I could even drive them anymore. I can&amp;#39;t do the work I used to do because of arthritis in my lower back and rheumatoid arthritis in my knees and feet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I consider myself weird and nerdy by I consider myself a homebody but I do like going out time to time that prefers to stay home. I have put myself out there in the dating scene for over 8 years, during those eight years I&amp;#39;ve had women catfish me pretending to want to be with me, leading me on as they loved me. then they would fake their death on me or they would just ghost me. I have had women telling me I was a joke worthless useless had nothing to offer a relationship and I shouldn&amp;#39;t even be loved and no one would want to be with me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have been trying to build myself a life and been trying to get on my feet but every time I do things come up that keep me down and knock me back down and I just can&amp;#39;t keep doing it anymore. it feels like every breath I take is just razors cutting through my lungs attracting me apart inside. I am tired of struggling to breathe. I am tired of trying to fight to build something out of my life. I am tired of spending every waking moment of my life alone single unloved unwanted.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All I wanted was to find a woman to love me and accept me and treat me right. I don&amp;#39;t ask for much just a simple life, all I want is just one or two friends a nice woman my own apartment and a vehicle that&amp;#39;s it. but it feels like I&amp;#39;m trying to reach to live on Pluto and it&amp;#39;s like it&amp;#39;s trying to ask for a billion dollars and to become the president of the whole world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am tired I am worn out I am exhausted I have nothing left in me to give nothing left in me to fight I can&amp;#39;t do it by myself anymore alone no support no one helping me constantly fighting and fighting and getting nowhere except right where I was when I started to try to fight to build something I can&amp;#39;t do it anymore so today when a woman that I rent bedroom from leaves I will end up ending my life.  I just have nothing left to live for and nothing left to do and nothing left in me.&lt;/p&gt;

,depression,"The main issue is, I need to clean my room. How do I clean my room when I’m sad?  I’m kind of used to wanting to die but it hurts more when I want to live and love so so badly but it’s impossibly hard. I’m also pretty used to not feeling great, but I wouldn’t say I feel actively sad often. Maybe heavy or hopeless or hurting or suicidal or breaking or anxious but not too often just like... boohoo sad, you know? But tonight it’s clinging to my chest like heavy cobwebs and I can’t do shit. Not even sleep. Since I’ve been a child I’ve craved love and comfort so badly, and I’ve never reliably experienced it without anxiety and the thought that I never will makes me sad. The thought that nothing is permanent makes me sad, even if most of the shit going on isn’t great. The thought that people leave and that people will leave and that I might always be broken makes me sad. All these simple truths keep breaking my heart.

How do I clean my room when I’m sad?  I’m kind of used to wanting to die but it hurts more when I want to live and love so so badly but it’s impossibly hard. I’m also pretty used to not feeling great, but I wouldn’t say I feel actively sad often. Maybe heavy or hopeless or hurting or suicidal or breaking or anxious but not too often just like... boohoo sad, you know? But tonight it’s clinging to my chest like heavy cobwebs and I can’t do shit. Not even sleep. Since I’ve been a child I’ve craved love and comfort so badly, and I’ve never reliably experienced it without anxiety and the thought that I never will makes me sad. The thought that nothing is permanent makes me sad, even if most of the shit going on isn’t great. The thought that people leave and that people will leave and that I might always be broken makes me sad. All these simple truths keep breaking my heart. If anyone knows how I can get my ass out of bed and clean my room, it would be much appreciated.&lt;/p&gt;

,depression,"Hello everyone,



I'm 25 right now and tbh, I just live from day to day. I don't really have goals, I barely have anything that sparks a fire in me.



I always had dreams of being respected, loved, admired and all that stuff.

Because my real life was not like this, I lost myself in fantasies, addictions and anger.



Sometimes it's incredibly difficult for me to just accept the point where I'm at, because I get so overwhelmed by self-loathing and constant questions like ""why does everyone experience love and sexuality and you're still a virgin?"", ""even if you do sports and do something about you, what does it even gonna change? You're still the same person, so perhaps she or girl x just doesn't like you that much""  and all of that.





There's a girl I really like, she has a boyfriend but I felt we always had a good vibe and also decided that we wanted to hangout together.

But sometimes I feel like this interest is just on my side. I mean, she likes my post and she is kind and everything, but it's not like a real friendship or a real contact and it makes me freaking sad, because the idea that she might not be part of my life honestly makes me really suicidal right now.





I know it's stupid to focus your entire life on one girl, and people tell me there are other girls, but I want her.

I have never met a girl in my life before that I think I liked that much, when I think about her I could cry because I don't know what to do.




Sometimes I would just love to send her a text that I love her and I wanna be with her, but I'm afraid that might ruin everything.



But the worst is that I always assumed to be in her friendzone, now I'm not even sure about that.
We text occasionally but I feel like the main interest in that comes from my side. And sometimes she doesn't even reply or it takes some time. Which makes me question how important I am to her.




The thought about not being a part of her life or her not being part of mine drives me insane.


I feel like whatever I do, I come second and I'll never get what I desire so much. I often feel like I will never be the guy that I want to be, which is why I hesitate to actually change anything.


Because I don't have the guarantee that it will work out.
Sometimes I feel like I could become the absolute best version of myself, what would it serve if she's still not interested?



I know I'm just surrendering to my emotions and wish-thinking right now, but that's just how it is..:(




The closer I get to 27 and the more I think about my boring and depressing life, the more I feel like I just wanna leave this world with a message for her and for the people that cared for me.



I don't wanna die really, but I can't deal with the feeling anymore of not being enough. Of feeling insecure.
I'm sick and tired of feeling anxious, sad, lost, hopeless.




All my life I've been searching but even if I find what seems to be the right place to stay, it's not mine.

Nothing is in fact mine. Everything is just there to collapse again.

I feel like whatever I want, I'm never enough just by nature.


There's always something you gotta do. Tbh, the main reason why I wanna do sports is to get this girl (or if it doesn't work out, other girls). I'm sick of being the guy that is always a bit off, always introverted and insecure. I hate life for being a rollercoaster.


People tell me ""don't worry, you'll find the right one"". But I think she is the right one. And even if she's not, I still want to make the experience somehow.



I finally want to be part of THAT life, the life that almost every normal person seems to experience. I know myself and I know how often my mood just collapses and I fall back into old patterns.



I have no reason to fight if I don't know that it will work out.

At this point, I just want out. I just want a good life. I just want to be the one that gets to be with her. The hero of the story.

But the older I get, the more I feel like I'm just a background actor, the guy that plays a small role in other people's life.




Perhaps enough to be a friend, never enough to be more than that.


Seriously, I'm so sick of it all... All the time passing by and I'm getting older and older and I'm still waiting for a better life to come. It will never come until I change something.

Some days I can kind of feel them coming on because I'm irritated, there's thoughts and I'm kinda agitated, that's usually followed by an episode of really intense depression with crying, being absolutely upset, not being able to think clearly, high tension/stress, fast heart rate, suicidal ideation… I've always compared it to a thunderstorm in my head. Then maybe an hour or two later it's just over from one minute to the next and I'm not able to understand what was going through my own head just a few minutes before and why I was so upset. I was never able to pin those phases to any specific situation or things currently going on in my life, although I briefly thought they were related to migraine. When those phases are over I always suddenly feel very calm, very hungry and I have a headache

,depression,"Every day that passes I hope is my last. I know that's a horrible thing to say but over the last while it's how I've been feeling, I look up to my ceiling and wonder how I'd look hanging from my roof.

A lot of it stems from loneliness. I'm at university, so I went in expecting to find my best friends there, and while yes there's a general group of friends I fell in with, I'm not as close with any of them as they are with other people in our group, for instance over this lockdown period I don't think any of them have actually wanted to keep talking to me one-on-one other than sending me a meme every other week or just using me for answers for any work that the uni have sent out. I don't think I've made any truly close friends at university that I can call my 'best friends', just that im part of a group, and don't get me wrong there's nothing wrong with the people in it at all they're great folks, it's just that there are people all of them have that they can rely on within the group and I don't have that, and there have been a number of times over the semesters where I have broke down because I genuinely had nobody in my life I considered a close friend.

A lot of it stems from my physical health too. I played football since I was 5 for my local team and it was great to play all through underage level. Although after I left U18 I have not played a full year of football, I've had hip injuries, hamstring injuries, back injuries to name a few, but most recently I had a major surgery on my arm, which is another long story I have had ongoing issues with for 10+ years and had numerous surgeries on before, it seemed like this one recently would be the one to fix all the issues I've had from it. With the problems the surgery fixed it has created more, which results in the arm being painful everyday, even to this day, meaning I can't do a lot more things than I could before. I was in a cast for more than 2 months, I'm still having physio from 2 physiotherapists, I can't do anything that puts the slightest amount of pressure on my arm and I have started to question whether or not this surgery was worth it, due to the fact that if I hadn't had the operation nothing would have changed and, instead of being exiled from the team because I haven't been able to train for nearly a year, I would have been part of the squad like normal, and I wouldn't be having these issues where my anxiety about going back and feeling like I don't belong to that group of lads is through the roof. I'm so scared to go back because I just don't feel worthy to be there due to the fact that I haven't been there all year and I will be judged for something that I couldn't control the outcome of.

I dunno whether anyone would be able to help me after this rant, and I know all this is so so much of a bullshit reason to be so depressed and miserable, but something happened over the last week in my brain that looked at things and genuinely thought about wrapping them around my neck and   hanging myself, and over the last few days especially I haven't been able to sleep, I've been shouting at random times out of sheer anxiety, it's gotten to the stage where I genuinely think I'm going to do something that will hurt my family and I would like some help if anyone can",t2_5aw1btu8,False,,0,False,Suicidal,[],r/depression,False,0,,0,,False,t3_h79dmm,False,dark,1.0,,public,5,0,{},,False,[],,False,False,,{},,False,5,,False,,False,,[],{},,True,,1591947499.0,text,0,,,text,self.depression,False,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Every day that passes I hope is my last.

,depression,"LONG RANTING POST/MY STORY: I feel me being born was a stroke of luck. My parents always wanted 3 kids and after my sister was born, they had a baby named Britney but she died while she was growing in the womb. Then came my older brother and me. If she didn't died in the womb, then I wouldn't be here and become a burden on everyone. I have dreams to better my life and making it big one day and becoming rich, but the problem is that I am a baby boy, lazy, unmotivated, and a ""bitch"" according to my sister's asshole fiance. Since 2009, my life been shit. I attempted suicide because I feel everyone hated me and nobody cared about me. Transferred at the beginning of 7th grade where I didn't connect with the people and I wanted to be popular, so I said shit in order to be cool. Hung aroung fake people while the people who seem to like me (including 5 girls to be exact) were ignored by me. Then my mom died in 2013 and my life hasn't been the same. I went to high school and it fucked me up in plenty of ways, although I discovered new music and a video game that pretty much kept me alive. In high school, I fell in love but long story short, she rejected me and I was obsessed with her, even though she had a boyfriend and when everybody was telling me to leave her alone, I didn't. Thankfully, I ended my friendship with her but I did it in a stupid way because she had sex with her boyfriend. And she told me that I made her life in high school a living hell. It was my fault, I didn't see what I was doing to her at the time because I was selfish and only cared about what she was doing to me. Anyway, my OCD Contamination took a turn for the worse and it still affects me to this day. I was in the bathroom for 2 hours and washing alot. Things seem to be better in 2017 until it was 2018 and that was a shitty year. I was acting up in community college and got kicked out of a class for interrupting lectures in African American Studies by asking questions and asking dumb questions (my fault), I liked a girl and we got together but she really didn't like me. She was a poor gf and basically used me for attention. She never came to my house because she didnt like the neighorhood. We made out and she said that I hurt her, despite I asked before doing anything and she always said ""yes"". And then my dumbass hooked up with a guy with no protection and that fucks me up to this day. I was taking medication for my OCD and I stopped afterward to get on PEP and not get HIV (the test came back negative, thankfully). I also cut many of my ""friends"" off, although I ruined like one friendship because she wasn't into me and she had a bf. I don't know why I thought that was okay at the time but moving on. Another girl I liked didn't want to hang out with me just to find out that she was pregnant later that year, although she told me that she didn't want a relationship in the summer of that year. And now, I screwed up some opportunites to intern or be in a mentorship program because I didn't submit the required things in time or I was too late to respond. My dad always call me a screwball because I screw things up. I guess he is right. I hope I die soon although I don't want to die. Me dying is for the best anyway. I dont want to kill myself but I just want all this to end. If I known my life was gonna be like this, I would chose to be an animal or a object instead. Better yet, another person. I always wonder why would life take my mom away from me instead of me? Its clear that im not shit and im a burden on people. My mom was a great person, lovely, and a popular person who loved a good time. It will alwaya be fuck life as long as i live. If i dont die by 2023, I swear, im gonna kill myself or something. I can barely even take life anymore. Music and my 4 year old niece is only things keeping me alive at this point. Also, if someone else in my family dies, i swear im gonna lose it. My dad, brother, sister, grandma, niece, and my sisters asshole fiance cant die before me. They got lives and need to continue on. I cant continue on by 2023. People need them. Nobody needs me, even if i had a job and all that. Everybody is tired of me and the real world would EAT ME ALIVE.

I also cut many of my &amp;quot;friends&amp;quot; off, although I ruined like one friendship because she wasn&amp;#39;t into me and she had a bf. I don&amp;#39;t know why I thought that was okay at the time but moving on. Another girl I liked didn&amp;#39;t want to hang out with me just to find out that she was pregnant later that year, although she told me that she didn&amp;#39;t want a relationship in the summer of that year. And now, I screwed up some opportunites to intern or be in a mentorship program because I didn&amp;#39;t submit the required things in time or I was too late to respond. My dad always call me a screwball because I screw things up. I guess he is right. I hope I die soon although I don&amp;#39;t want to die. Me dying is for the best anyway. I dont want to kill myself but I just want all this to end. If I known my life was gonna be like this, I would chose to be an animal or a object instead. Better yet, another person. I always wonder why would life take my mom away from me instead of me? Its clear that im not shit and im a burden on people. My mom was a great person, lovely, and a popular person who loved a good time. It will alwaya be fuck life as long as i live. If i dont die by 2023, I swear, im gonna kill myself or something. I can barely even take life anymore. Music and my 4 year old niece is only things keeping me alive at this point. Also, if someone else in my family dies, i swear im gonna lose it. My dad, brother, sister, grandma, niece, and my sisters asshole fiance cant die before me. They got lives and need to continue on. I cant continue on by 2023. People need them. Nobody needs me, even if i had a job and all that. Everybody is tired of me and the real world would EAT ME ALIVE. Its funny that for all the shit that happened to you, you have no one to blame but YOU.&lt;/p&gt;

,depression,"I never post things on any kind of website really, but right now to better myself I think I need to say something. Since elementary school till now I’ve felt like I’ve been ghost. Drifting in a desert full of potentially wonderful people living there lives, without knowing how to connect theirs to mine. I’ve been having to deal with depression since I was 12 and believe it’s because of this. 

Eight months ago I think this came to a crux, setting off a wave of panic attacks I’ve only started to fix now. Despite pushing to better myself it feels like fate keeps slamming my fingers to throw me back into void I’ve spent most my life in. At late 19 after a bunch of good therapy and well working medication, I was finally getting enough energy to do stuff again. However this was short-lived. Due to the sudden drop of my old medication, five days later I had a massive migraine which seemingly only lasted a day. Unfortunately lasting side effects occurred leaving My eyes too sensitive to do anything for around nine months. I was basically bedridden. 

It felt like all those years were thrown away for a new hell. Despite the new depression medication, being in your room for that long gets to your head. I started feeling down again. But I managed to get through it with patience and yet another medication change (yay). So at the start of summer vacation with migraines fixed and my depression being handled I was finally doing something again. It was just one small online class but it was something! I was proud of that. The hardest part of my life seemed to be over. :D

Two weeks later I was in the emergency room. I had my first panic attack on the way to a concert I said I would go to with my twin and his friends. Despite being told that anxiety and depression go hand-in-hand, I innocently dismissed this, thinking I had it a bit different because I’ve never felt much anxiety before. Turns out I was just REALLY good at bottling it up over the years. But a bottles got to pop, and boy did it pop. 
For the first two months, anxiety so bad I couldn’t drive for more than a minute or else I would get a full on panic attack causing me to barely breathe then leading to me actually crying, for fear of passing out and crashing. For the first three months anxiety so bad a normal breathe that wasn’t shallow was a godsend. Mini panic attacks that made me feel complete dissociation with the world(not fun). And to top it off a second trip to the hospital, because my awful anxiety amplified a migraine leaving half my body slightly numb. A little numbness is usual for migraines but this was different. (I thought I was having a stroke haha.)

I’m going to honest, this completely broke me. I’m so tired.
Although right now I am grateful that my anxiety has been warded off mostly. I’ve recently assessed my situation, and after looking back up for the first time in a while it seems like emotionally I’m back in a hole... At least it’s a different one eh? 

The reason why I’m saying all this is because I figured out most of this is caused by my loneliness. In middle school when I started feeling depressed the only friends I had were my brothers friends. I would hang out with them at lunch time, but that’s about it. Although that seemed to keep my loneliness at bay. 
My depression became clinical in the first months of high school. This is also when my brothers friend group split and went separate ways leaving me truly alone for the first time. After lots of reflection over the years, I now know that my depression becoming clinical was not as random as it seemed. 

Then we come to the panic attack. Simply put my loneliness just came to a head. Me and subconscious couldn’t deny my reality anymore. Being in a small car with people who weren’t my  friends driving to a concert where I knew I was just going to feel alone in a crowd was the tipping point I guess.

Don’t want to jinx it, but I think I’m climbing back up again. I feel so incredibly behind on everything, yet after all this emotional pain I feel like I’ve lived a lifetime. I’m so young yet I feel like the only energy I have left is to sit in the sand and enjoy other people doing there thing. But I guess I’ve always been doing that. 

Oh well, despite this strange feeling of self entropy I’ll carry on. 
Cas f**k it!

I just gotta remember on how dismissive of my suicidal thoughts she was when explaining them or how she let our family cat die. If this ""good bob"" is so good, then why didn't he help the love of his life out of the shack she and ""his children"" were living in with the alcoholic dad who sleeps with whores weekly?

-Keep  making friends who later turn into shit

-Keep losing basic shit in her mountain of shit(shes a hoarder)

-Let the family cat die when we had the choice of bringing him to our new home

-Have kids when she just lives in a shack with wheels(runned down rv)

-Proceed to poorly raise the youngest(aka her successor to the universe, aka me) to the point were they have no ability to handle basic responsibilities

-Not cut family that is toxic to her out of her life sooner

-Not remember names of places or people and remember where they are or who they are

&lt;p&gt;I want to tell my doctor about my depression tomorrow. I’m not looking forward to it. I’m accustomed to hiding my feelings. Do my notes sound okay? I’m probably going to be talking to my doctor over the phone, which sounds uncomfortable. 🤷🏻‍♂️&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;•no motivation or desire to pursue anything(constant)
•no life goals
•sense I’m running out of time
•I feel lazy and incapable(constant)
•feel like I have no future(constant)
•feel “allergic” to action
•not many hobbies to speak of(I draw occasionally, and watch a lot of TV and YouTube. I listen to music often. I used to draw and read all the time when I was younger.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When working:
•trouble getting up and there on time
•I dread going everyday
•afraid of phone calls(making and taking them)
•work performance is affected(my boss called me lack-luster and I creep out customers with my dead eyes)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;•lots of driving anxiety, I avoid it if I can
•guilt over feeling like others have to take care of me &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not constant, but for weeks at a time(used to be constant for years before T): 
•decreased appetite(used to go three days without eating sometimes before T)
•digestive issues
•pain in back and dull ache in limbs
•body and chest feel heavy&lt;/p&gt;

,depression,"So in the past sixth months the following things have happened. I’m a 32 year old male. (For context I was abused mentally and physically as a child/teen by both my father and stepfather and have struggled with anxiety most of my life. Now I fear depression)
1. My grandmother who was the most important person in my life finally lost her battle with cancer. I’m devastated but I’ve had to basically hold everything together and take care of everything that needed to happen like funeral arrangements etc. I feel like I haven’t had tune to mourn. 
2. My fathers alcoholism had finally caught up to him. He fell in a drunken accident and hurt his spine/neck. He laid on the floor for almost two days before someone found him. He lives alone. If he lives he will be at best a paraplegic. He is currently fighting off a body wide infection and withdrawal from the booze. He is in and out of consciousness. He has burned all the bridges in his life so I have been dealing with being his proxy even though we were very limited contact. He has no one else. 
3. I come from an extremely religious family. I have decided to not follow the religion anymore as of five years ago. I’ve been dating a woman for a little over a year and things are starting to change. My family won’t acknowledge her because I’m dating outside the religion. They barely speak to me anyway. Her family struggles with accepting me because I have such a different background and upbringing and have had trouble adjusting to their perspective and points of view. I feel like they would prefer her to date the cookie cutter kinda guy. Someone you would see on a teen drama kinda guy.  I grew up in a poor area and had to work for almost everything in my life. They are the more well off head in the clouds kinda family and judge me a lot for things that I had no control over. 
4. December of 2019 my business partner and I finally opened our business after a lot of time and money invested into getting things up and running.

5. My girlfriend was just laid off from her job and she is freaking out about it. It has put a huge strain on our relationship and I’m trying to be supportive but I’m so low myself it’s hard to help her.  
6. My mother pretty much blames everything bad that has happened to me on me leaving the religion.

I’m a 32 year old male. (For context I was abused mentally and physically as a child/teen by both my father and stepfather and have struggled with anxiety most of my life. Now I fear depression)
1. My grandmother who was the most important person in my life finally lost her battle with cancer. I’m devastated but I’ve had to basically hold everything together and take care of everything that needed to happen like funeral arrangements etc. I feel like I haven’t had tune to mourn. 
2. My fathers alcoholism had finally caught up to him. He fell in a drunken accident and hurt his spine/neck. He laid on the floor for almost two days before someone found him. He lives alone. If he lives he will be at best a paraplegic. He is currently fighting off a body wide infection and withdrawal from the booze. He is in and out of consciousness. He has burned all the bridges in his life so I have been dealing with being his proxy even though we were very limited contact. He has no one else. 
3. I come from an extremely religious family. I have decided to not follow the religion anymore as of five years ago. I’ve been dating a woman for a little over a year and things are starting to change. My family won’t acknowledge her because I’m dating outside the religion. They barely speak to me anyway. Her family struggles with accepting me because I have such a different background and upbringing and have had trouble adjusting to their perspective and points of view. I feel like they would prefer her to date the cookie cutter kinda guy. Someone you would see on a teen drama kinda guy.  I grew up in a poor area and had to work for almost everything in my life. They are the more well off head in the clouds kinda family and judge me a lot for things that I had no control over. 
4. December of 2019 my business partner and I finally opened our business after a lot of time and money invested into getting things up and running. Things were going good and appearing to be promising. Then corona happened. We had to close for almost three months. We are back open now but I don’t know if the business is going to survive the hit we took in the three months we were closed. It halted our momentum. I’m afraid we will have to close.

,depression,"I've been using it for more than 13 years (of depression) as a way to access my fantasy world/escape mechanism. Now that I'm trying to be more present with my uncomfortable reality, I feel like I will have to delete all of my music in order to avoid the temptation to relapse. It does feel like an addiciton, I don't know if it would be more helpfuld than damaging.

It would be a big deal for me since I have been obsessed with music for so long, I've identified with it as my main interest and I have been able to play instruments intuitively with no training. I would have loved to create my own music as a form of self-expression, even if with little to no recognition, I would have been content. However, after many failed attempts at trying to create melodies (it's not that I can't create good ones, I can't create ANY), I decided it's pointless to pursue other musical skills since what matters to me most is the melody. After accepting the reality that I'm not like my favorite artists who, regardless of musical background, the melodies flow to them easily, I'm left being only a music aficionado, which is something that I have convinced myself for so long that it is not enough.

The momentary good experience I get from listening to my favorite music quickly gets overshadowed by the sadness of never being able to express myself in that way, or it will trigger my over-sensitivity which can leave me non-functional for weeks. The only way to bypass it is, while listening to the music, to enter a fantasy world in which I COULD make music. That has been my escape mechanism for 13 years, it has become an instinct more than a habit, and I don't want to go on that way.

I always thought there was something wrong with me, but a year ago I realized how abusive my parents were.

I struggled to heal myself since a year ago. I tried so hard. But when you’re living with your abusers, it’s so damn hard.

I’m thirteen. This year I’m going into high school. I was assigned to this low ranking high school by boundary. I wanted to transfer to this very high ranked high school, and even better: this high school was where my best friend was going. We had shared many good memories together. I wanted to make more with her again. I had been so excited for it. No one told me that I couldn’t transfer unless I met a certain criteria, and I guess my school counselor didn’t know either. Now I can’t transfer. I thought I could get my life together with this.

I figured I would try and cheer myself up. I asked my mom if I could get a nose ring, to which she yelled at me and said no. I tried to bargain with her, and I wasn’t rude. I tried to bring up points because she said it was a bad thing to have nose piercings. In the end she just told me to be quiet and leave her alone.

I’ve been having a horrible week. My traumatic flashbacks and intrusive thoughts have been getting worse.

I’m so fucking angry.

a few weeks ago, I ended a relationship with my girlfriend of over a year. it was very much time, and it needed to happen. I've been hanging out with friends a lot, and it's been great. but sometimes, my friends hang out, and I'm not with them. it's pretty situational and I know it's nothing personal, but now, probably because I'm single, I've seemed to put all my happiness onto them, as I've just been feeling waaaayyyyy unreasonably down when they hang out without me.

,depression,"I went to the hospital after I tried to cut my wrists. I missed my veins several times and eventually gave up. I was walking around with a cut up arm and tried to end my own life; this is when I realized something was wrong and I need help. Upon hindsight, I was extremely naive to do this but I showed my arm to my school councilor. He was the only one at school I trusted with this type of information.

I think it was there when I was diagnosed. Ever since I have been seeing my therapist regularly. 

For a while after seeing my therapist, I was starting to question if the constant self harm, self-loathing and unhappiness was a result of some type of chemical imbalance (something that I’m not controlling/can’t control).

Turns out I have major depressive disorder (clinical depression).

,depression,"I am F23. I have dealt with depression for as long as I can remember and had several suicide attempts along the way. I made this post hoping that someone would have some advice or suggestions that I hadn’t uncovered or thought of. I often times feel as though reality isn’t even real. Almost like I’m in a dream-state or out of touch with my physical self. My mind is constantly narrating my life and being very critical of everything I witness/experience. My intrusive thoughts and impulses truly scare me at times. I do a lot of things in order to try and combat my depression and intrusive thoughts/impulses. I wrote out a list below. Regardless of these attempts I still become easily overwhelmed by life and constantly live in fear, self-doubt, and self-loathing. I don’t understand how even though I’m doing all these things to help myself I’m still suffering so much mentally. 

Here’s the breakdown:
I have a healthy, happy marriage of 2 years. 
I have secure employment. 
I am debt free.
I have money in my savings.
I work out everyday.
I do yoga each evening.
I have practiced meditation on &amp; off over the last 2 years.
I get at least 7-8 hours of sleep each night. 
I journal frequently.
I rarely consume alcohol.
I don’t over caffeinate (less than 100mg per day) 
I rarely rarely experiment with drugs (MDMA/LSD)
I eat a healthy diet, low in sugar, &amp; low in processed foods. 
I have a therapist.
I practice gratitude (although it doesn’t always produce the feeling of being grateful)
I read self-help and try to implement what I’ve read.
I keep my space organized &amp; clean.
I make my bed each day.
I take 60 seconds in the shower with the cold water on in order to reduce my reactions to stressors.
I take a daily multivitamin. 

Again if anyone has any advice or suggestions I’m open to them. Thanks

,depression,"I don't know why I'm posting here exactly, but I think that it will help me get my words out into the world. So here's my story:

I developed depression, suicidal thoughts, and anxiety at the age of 12. I was heavily abused by mom's methhead ex, and have been told that he will kill me. Since then I a have a reoccurring nightmare of me slitting my wrists in the bathroom. I hear my mom screaming as her ex starts beating her to death, and I try to open the door. However, with all the blood loss I'm too weak and slowly die on the floor. I had this dream twice a week for about 6 years, but now it's about once a month. 

After my mom and her ex separated, I was 14 and confessed to my mom about my depression, and she said that I was a self centered liar who only wanted attention. I began to spiral out of control and developed frequent panic attacks. It was also at the time that I convinced myself that if my life by the time I'm 18 is even lower than I am now, I would kill myself. Throughout highschool I struggled with bulimia and anorexia. Days were a blur, but I knew I had to stick it out until I was 18. 

Birthday rolls around and things are actually looking up. I recently gained my first friend, and we just bought a house. I was hopeful for the first time in my life. However, about 2 months later shit hits the fan. I learn that I have to testify against my mom's ex in court, and I have a incident with my siblings where I was kicked out and forced to live in my car.

 I finally decided to try and take my life once and for all. I take a bottle of oxycodone that I had after getting a wisdom tooth removed and swallow them all. I began panicking and threw them all up. I cried on the ground for what felt like hours. 

That leads me to today. I'm just going through the motions, and have just finished my first year of college. I fixed the issues with my family, and now able to live back home.

I’m still a teenager and I guess you can say hormones have to do with a lot of what I’m going through, not that I yell at my parents or anything like that. I feel like I’m meant to be a support for someone , because I don’t think of myself as someone who’s important. I think I realized this a couple years back when no one really checked up on me. I realized that my emotions don’t matter when it comes to anyone else’s. I have tried venting to someone but it makes me feel like they see me differently now. Or I think they feel like they should give me some sort of “ special treatment “. Growing up I never had any “child hood friends” , not that I wasn’t social I was a very social kid . I would just move every year of my life up until middle school. So Everytime Im like In a group of friends I feel out of place, I feel lonely. But at the same time I don’t want to be alone I want to be distracted from myself. 

I lost my best friend , and I feel like I really don’t have anyone to really lean on. Deep down I’ve always wanted someone to hold me and let me cry on them without judgment, but I know that won’t happen. Some days I just think what’s up with this cruel world with that’s going on worldwide. My best friend was everything to me. I felt like they were the first person I really came close to feeling “love” with. Sure I’ve had girlfriends but “love” or a really deep sense of caring was never there . At school I don’t act depressed , I act “ normal “. I have a group of friends I’m close with and still with . Even then I still feel out of place. Sadness has always been in my heart for as long as I can remember. I don’t see myself in the future. I can’t imagine myself like I used to. I did have goals but no motivation to try to accomplish them. Right now I’m holding onto someone that I know will really hurt me in the long run but it’s what I’m “living” for I guess you could say. I’m pretty sure this person wants me for attention and will throw me out once they’re satisfied. I feel like I can’t show emotions to them because If I do I’m afraid they’ll stop talking to me. For example, I got mad at them today , but they got mad at me for being mad at them you know . So I felt like if I do show anything that would annoy them like that they would get fed up and let go of me. I’m trying so hard to hold onto them. But honestly it’s whatever. It sounds really weird because I’m not really showing context but I just don’t wanna reveal a lot you know. 

I have a job at a smoothie place ,I work like 6 hours everyday not much but it helps me focus on a task. I feel like an empty shell everyday. I sometimes wish I wasn’t born because dealing with everything is annoying. And I know people go through harder things each day and I’m irrelevant compared to them . And I am grateful for living in a house and being able to attend school. But I just wanted to write down a few Things to the internet because I find it easier like that.

Every time I didn't snap back had all the disadvantages of snapping back anyway, both with that person and with others. 

Having a good work ethic has always carried all the disadvantages of having a terrible one, everywhere I've ever worked. 

Letting go of the past hasn't helped me at all.

Being willing to drop the old fashioned ""cuckoo barn"" stigma of a mental hospital, and deciding of my own accord to go to one, I explained how I was feeling to everyone involved, and I learned new lessons that did give me a sense of confidence in terms of reentering normal life, with new ways to ""accept"" any of the same BS. I took pride in times where I didn't get hit as hard by something as in the past. At least until I got dismissed from the new job I had gotten, despite all those lessons I'd learned at the mental hospital, despite not holding any grudges, despite not taking anyone's anger personally, despite all the lessons I had learned over the years at my old job about letting go of little things. 

None of my relationships feel ""real"" anymore, and my family is always at a loss for ideas when I try to ask them for advice. I never meet someone who has a friend, or a friend of a friend, or anyone down that endless chain, with any success stories. 

Things that I used to do as a hobby do not feel fun anymore without a way to show it to anybody. Even before the pandemic I tried to find in-person groups that were hobby based. They were always people who did it as a job, and they neither liked their job nor had a hobby outside of their job. So I turned to online forums and tried to post about what I have made, problems I'm having, or ones I HAD and already solved. Views and thumb ups staying in the single digits for months, and trying other hobbies or presenting them differently always had the same result. 

Trying again during the pandemic to find an online forum of (insert hobby here) feeling like ""oh, everyone will be online now being stuck at home with nothing else to do"" and finding them just as barren as they were before then. 

I guess if someone spends their entire ducking life tapping away at a keyboard or touch screen, the last thing they would want to do is use the very thing they never put down anyway to discuss even their most favorite thing in the world.

I've lost interest in everything that used to make me happy. I just dont really know how to spend my day. I feel terrible, I'm malnourished and sleep deprived.

       Life in general just feels like a fever dream. Is this all there is to life? Repetition, loneliness, depression, and self-hatred? No matter how many medications I take, no matter how many counseling sessions I go to, nothing changes. No difference, no one loves me, still depressed, I still hate myself. Sometimes I just want to escape this neverending nightmare. I suspect I will kill myself at some point. 
      Sometimes I think back to when I was a kid and all the dreams and aspirations I had for my future back then. It breaks my heart to know that I failed at so many of those things. I wish I would have been a better person. I wish I could have accomplished so much more. I wish I had someone to share all my love with :(

,depression,"I guess I'm in a kind of crisis right now. I have been mercilessly miserable for days and have been constantly thinking about killing myself more than usual. But I don't want to die, I just don't want to feel this wretched. 

I have no one to talk to so I've been reading articles online meant to inspire people that everything is going to be ok. The only advice I see is ""this shall pass"". So what? I know it will pass, but it will return, probably quickly. 

I also see ""get help"" over and over. I've gotten help many times over the past 15 years. I've taken many medicines, seen probably 8 therapists, exercised, got sober (several times, currently 10 months sober) .

,depression,"Hi! Treatment-resistant depression going on five years now. Doing much better than I was three years ago, but arguably still pretty bad. After like two years of trying and missed connections I finally got my foot in the door for intranasal Ketamine (Spravado) at a local hospital's clinic, and today was treatment two of eight (over five weeks).

The first time was a standard starting dosage--56mg. Dissociation/slowed down/wider field of view/sounds more apparent/staring at my hands a lot. Kind of pleasant and comforting.

Two days later I go in for the second round--doc says, you tolerated #1 pretty well, we're upping to 84mg. Ohh mannnn, it \*sucked.\* So agitated. Crazy anxiety. Time went really fast (but also not fast?). Watched my blood pressure on the vitals monitor, it totally spiked. Worst of it was over after about an hour; but I walked around the rest of the day angry, tired, and on edge. 

Like, I guess that's what people mean when they say there's good trips and bad trips. (I went in to day 2 preoccupied with work and stressed, which probably made things worse.)

I guess I'm just wondering, for other folks who have been through similar drug trials, how was your experience through the whole program? Are there ups and downs? Do you develop a tolerance to the dissociation/anxiety/different dosages?

Doc said acute experiences the day of treatment don't actually correlate with long-term treatment outcomes (i.e. don't worry if the actual drug trip sucked, long-term it'll be fine), but today was just \*so bad\*.

,depression,"Hello, 19 year old Australian here, just looking for a place to vent and get some perspective I guess.

So this whole thing needs some context, I'll try to keep it short so your time isn't eaten up.



I grew up with my mother and sister, my brother and father leaving the family before I was born, and growing up I was always the quiet one while my sister was the one getting into trouble.

Growing up, I had no friends as I was bullied right out of primary education for being blind in one eye and possessing a muscle deficiency, this meant I was inside a lot with only my sister and mother to keep me company, which I didn't mind, thinking it would persist, however I was wrong.

My sister left to go about her own goals at 16, leaving just me and Mum, who was homeschooling me at this stage, and my video games which I increasingly relied upon with every day that passed.

Since, I went through age 12-18 building an online group of friends that keeps me sane, as I never had the drive or goals to focus on that my sister did, all of the specific occupation work I wanted to join don't accept blind and/or muscle deficient people, among them being military and police duties.

I've developed horrendous self-worth, and have a constant need to feel validated because I've never felt like I've won at anything meaningful, ever. 

Every hobby I've tried I've lost motivation in because every failure feels like a sucker punch, every setback a mountain instead of the anthill it really is.


I also have nobody I trust to confide my fears into or consult, my mother could be quite aggressive when I was younger and I developed a genuine fear of both disappointing her and upsetting her in equal measure, and laying my feelings on the table feels more akin to volunteering for interrogation than discussing problems.

I also don't go to my sister because I'm not much like her, I love her to bits but her personality conflicts with mine and I also feel inferior to her in every regard, so a bit of fear of failure hampering that, too.


I have, somehow, obtained real friends through my 3-year participation at a TAFE school in my local area, but I constantly compare myself to them negatively and feel like both;
A burden because I'm quiet and lack any social skills.  The laughing stock of my friend group for the same reasons.

I like to think I'm very empathetic, but that's about all I'm good for and my anxiety keeps me from trying to breach my comfort bubble no matter how much positive reinforcement I obtain.


This leaves me where I am at now.
19 years old with no healthy hobbies, no ability to drive a car, a terrible self worth due to my disadvantages and a dysfunctional family and friend environment.

I feel consistently unloved and don't exactly blame anyone for it, I have mistreated my mother in my opinion but my complete lack of drive slows any attempt to fix my errors to a standstill, same goes for any attempt to bond with my sister, so their poor opinion of me is warranted I feel.

I feel like my friends wouldn't notice if I stopped visiting, as I don't really talk to them much anyway on account of not having anything interesting to say, though I do visit to check on their mental health a lot of the time. 

A lot of days I wake up and breathe a sigh of disappointment, it would be easier for my family and friends if this coddled, pointless kid I am was replaced by someone with a drive, or if that weren't possible, if I hadn't existed in the first place as was planned.


Even so, here I am, I'm not going anywhere and nothings going to change, this is the point where a stronger person would realize the only way to survive is by going up, but I can't seem to reach that state no matter how strongly I think I want to.



So yeah, that's the state of me I guess, thanks for reading if you did, hope you're doing better than I am.

,depression,"I started medications back in September and was on them for four months, until January. The psychiatrist that put me on them did not listen to me and literally forgot that he’d prescribed me the drugs in the first place. They made me so tired that I had to tell my school and sleep during at least 2 periods a day, even with a bunch of coffee and adequate sleep the night before. They also made me have more suicidal thoughts and want to cut, but they calmed my anxiety down a bit which made me confused as to whether I should stay on them or not. 
After my psychiatrist refused to listen to me a second time and asked me who put me on the drugs in the first place (it was literally him), I decided to quit. I was in my final year of high school and I could not throw this year away to medicine, as my grades were dropping due to my low level of energy and my attendance in school was minimal because I could never wake up in the morning. 
My therapist doesn’t even know my first name. She cannot remember it for the life of her. And the last time I saw her I tried to bring up my fears of having manic depression and explain to her all of the reasons why and she completely ignored me. She talks to me like I am a child and like she understands the way I feel better than I do. She forgets everything I tell her (like I said, including my name), and doesn’t seem very interested in anything I have to say other than the answers to her own predetermined (before the sessions) questions. My last therapist stopped responding to my mother about our sessions and my mom did not really care enough to reach out again. I do not understand why I have reached out to professionals and they choose to throw medication and stupid ideas at me instead of listening to how I feel and actually wanting to diagnose and fix whatever is wrong with me. I understand psychiatrists are not therapists and medication is their job but I should still be able to talk about whatever I need to with a psychiatrist to help him better understand my feelings and needs. 
I have been concerned that I have manic depression (more commonly known as Bipolar Disorder now) for years. The first time I talked to another psychiatrist she asked me one question that I don’t even remember, then dismissed me as just trying to diagnose myself and told me that my depression (which is still not a real diagnosis, I’ve just been told I have depression, not even clinical depression) wasn’t as bad as I thought it was just because I “got angry sometimes and felt good sometimes”, which is definitely not how I’d described any of it to her.

But my mom, who always gets asked this and says no decides that she wanted to go. I got dressed first and she tried to make my dad pick who to go. I ended up going and she said she was not going motorcycle riding with him this summer. Me and my dad was watching the news and she told us to turn it off because it was annoying. A few days later, I was about to take a late night shower before I go to bed and my mom asked me how long I'm going to take in there So I said about 15 minutes. She said it get out by five minutes, because she needs to go in there( she always waits until in need to go in there and tells me to go use the other bathroom . she also always emphasis that its her bathroom. I asked her why cant' I ever just come and leave if i just going to be in there for 15 minutes? Anyways, we started arguing ( my mom tells me to shut up and that she doesn't feel like hearing my voice. Here she comes banging on the door and telling me to open up or she will lock pick the door and grab my throat to chock me up . I said if she touches me i will call the police and mom says if i keep running my mouth she will kick me out of the house. I told her if she doesn't want to hear me anymore then fine and i cut my arm in front of her. she grabs said knife and threatens to call police, but dad said not to. This wasn't my first time attempting to cut and all of them end with just a red scratch that draws no blood. I cried and said no one wants me here and no one listens to me.

I got dressed first and she tried to make my dad pick who to go. I ended up going and she said she was not going motorcycle riding with him this summer. Me and my dad was watching the news and she told us to turn it off because it was annoying. A few days later, I was about to take a late night shower before I go to bed and my mom asked me how long I&amp;#39;m going to take in there So I said about 15 minutes. She said it get out by five minutes, because she needs to go in there( she always waits until in need to go in there and tells me to go use the other bathroom . she also always emphasis that its her bathroom. I asked her why cant&amp;#39; I ever just come and leave if i just going to be in there for 15 minutes? Anyways, we started arguing ( my mom tells me to shut up and that she doesn&amp;#39;t feel like hearing my voice. Here she comes banging on the door and telling me to open up or she will lock pick the door and grab my throat to chock me up . I said if she touches me i will call the police and mom says if i keep running my mouth she will kick me out of the house. I told her if she doesn&amp;#39;t want to hear me anymore then fine and i cut my arm in front of her. she grabs said knife and threatens to call police, but dad said not to. This wasn&amp;#39;t my first time attempting to cut and all of them end with just a red scratch that draws no blood. I cried and said no one wants me here and no one listens to me.

,depression,"Hi, I'm 15 soon to be 16, I don't know what to do. For a few months, I've started thinking maybe I'd be better off dead, but eventually, it got worse. It eventually seems I couldn't go a day without thinking I should just kill myself. Sometimes I felt like I would really do it some days. I have a pretty good idea of how and where I'd do that.

And I don't know what to do, I feel like the universe is screaming at me. It seems things just have gone downhill since the beginning of 2019. I just don't really think I should be alive anymore, I have multiple reasons.

For one I don't see the point in me being alive because I feel like I've failed, and I'm just too stupid to be alive.

It seems now that everything I touch just breaks, it didn't use to be that way. And I might not get anywhere in life anyway. My whole family thinks I'm a crazy fruitloop because I rock back and forth. And being called a fruitloop or being compared to my cousin or aunt is like the worst of worst insults.

And I'm just so tired of trying to do anything, I used to be able to fix things. I just can't do anything anymore, I  can't imagine feeling any other way. It's been so long since I've actually read a book, I just can't seem to read one. Especially my chemistry books, I almost feel scared to open them. I just can't, and I used to really like studying chemistry. I can't seem to think straight anymore, sometimes I don't think at all. sometimes I just can't sleep. I used to enjoy doing lots of things, but now it's like I can't even do those things anymore. Lately, I've felt pretty blank. I don't really like thinking about things, because it only ends up being depressing thoughts. Though I keep to myself about mental health because all that would be seen as ""crazy"" or ""fruitloop shit"". So I've kept a lot in my head for the past year or two.

And my dreams at night have gotten pretty bad. It's either I don't seem to dream at all that night, or I have horrible dreams that just remind me of my worthlessness and everything I hate about myself along with more reasons why I should just give up life. They almost make me feel 10x worse.

i used to try so hard to do good things: help people, be more selfless, try and be more considerate. it doesn't matter. whether i'm good or bad life just fucks it up.

the only reason why i even bothered living is because i want to have hope that there's a better future. that even though the past and present are shit i can be happy one day. i'd just cry myself to sleep while listening to music or something. pretty sure my headphones have been stolen from me and that kinda took me off the edge. music is yhe only way i know how to forget about my feelings for some time. 

maybe it's just been this week that really ticked me off. my parents have insulted me so many times and if i bother to confront them i'll just get yelled at. if i ask to see a therapist they'll say that i can talk to them even though they have never shown any type of remorse or sorrow for me. i'm not allowed to get a job. i'm supposed to be a doctor or lawyer. too many expectations to live up to.

i can't talk to friends. they've never bothered to ask how i felt and it's always been a one sided relationship. i'm too scared of confrontation so i can't just leave them either. even if they've actually cared i push them away. i don't feel like i know them as someone i can trust.

i don't even know how long i've felt like this. 5 years or something? i remember being 10 and saying how i wanted to die when i was 16. one more year. i don't want to say i'm depressed because for all i know this is just some teen angst bullshit that i've consistently been able to keep up with. i don't want to take away from people that actually have depression.

there's nothing good about my life. i know i have a roof over my head, food, clothes, and water but i'd so much rather have none of that and be happy.

i kinda lied. only reason i'm still alive is because i'm too scared to kill myself. if i knew where the guns were in my house i'd probably shoot myself. recently i've been thinking about suicide by cop. maybe i'll get lucky and it'll be a racist one that's eager to kill me.

,depression,"When I was younger my father warned me that depression runs in our family, that he dealt with depression in his 20s but no one told him that it was hereditary nor did they help him and he suffered for years because of it. He told me that if I ever started feeling depression to tell him. I was 17 when he told me and now I'm in my 20s and it seems that my genetic dread is starting to kick in. Buckle up because I'm telling the full story of my spiral.

For my whole life I've always had this one desire, to be loved by one and only one and to become a married man. I've had that dream since I was a child.

19 years old and purposed my to the woman who was my girl friend at the time.

Everyone said that I was too young, that I haven't experienced my young years enough. All those comments rolled off of me as I was happy that I was in a relationship and going to get married. 

We've been together for 6 years now. But my mind and heart has started to deteriorate.

Now in my 20s, I didn't go to college. I didn't explore like I've always dreamed of. I've never been with anyone else other than the one I'm engaged to. I only made decisions that benefited the relationship and my partner but never myself. I figured that personal desires and needs were worth far less then my partners and that in doing this made me an amazing caregiver and doing otherwise would be selfish of me.

2019 things started to change. I started getting developing feelings of unease. I started reflecting on what people have said over the years and what I've actually been doing with my life since I graduated high school in 2015. I started noticing other woman more and my personal desires started growing more and more as the days went by. I started feeling horrible for having these thoughts. I felt like I was being selfish and all around just a person. Simultaneously however, Doubt started to develop. Why didn't I go to college? Why haven't I dated anyone else outside of my home town? How do I know that I'm actually happy? Was it the right decision to purpose to young and also so quickly? the internal conflict between ""why am I so selfish"" and ""why haven't I done anything for me?"" started to eat away at em. I thought about my fathers words but thought ""Its not depression, its just something I need to work out. but why does it hurt so much?""

I never brought these growing feelings up to my partner, she herself deals with a lot of anxiety so I didn't want to worsen things by bring up my issues that would spiral her into depression. I told myself ""I'm a good guy and I've always been! that's who I am"". However this ended up spiraling me into frustration. I wanted to start doing more personal things for myself to make me happy like seeing my friends more. This caused our relationship to enter a period of aggression. I was told that I'm being selfish. At this point I started to feel unhappy.

I convinced myself that in reality I'm not a good person, that I'm selfish and that my selfishness is bad. I would say ""I'm not a good person, I'm just a bad person who tries to hide it by doing good things."" I accepted and dove into this mind set. I started lying. Lying about where I was, who I was with, everything. I couldn't stop lying. I started spending a lot of time with another woman in secret. I couldn't recognize who I was when I looked in the mirror. I hated myself. I hated myself for not doing things for me for so many years and I hated myself for becoming an untrustworthy lair.

Ironically I work as a receptionist at a Counseling Center and till this point I never spoke with any of the counselors about the growing pains inside. Eventually I did. I started talking to one of the counselors and started spending a lot of time with her outside of work in secret. Lying reignited the feeling of being alive, but when I returned home I returned to feeling unhappy. this went on for months and when my partner found out about what I've been doing, I still didn't stop. I continued to lie. I felt like I couldn't stop myself because it were the only times it made me feel at least okay or maybe even happy. So I didn't stop.

Of course this all has put a huge strain on the relationship of my fiance and I. But I couldn't help myself.
During all of this thus far I still never considered that I was depressed.

My confidence started to rise. I started to believe I was feeling somewhat okay. I started recollecting myself. I started reconnecting with old friends I haven't talked to for years. One of which those people was a different woman. Someone who I've held strong feelings for years. Someone who I've always wanted but never could be with. 

I Invited her over to catch up. We haven't spoken in 4 years and yet it felt like no time had passed at all. in those 4 years she has done everything I've always dreamed of doing. while I've done nothing. That night after speaking with her I had a realization of how pitiful and unhappy I really was. I had a complete mental break down that night. I lost my mind.

After that night I continued to speak with her in secret every day. But I felt worse and worse everyday. I started feeling my insides being crushed every day. My feelings towards her returned. All I could think of was ""why does this hurt so much?""

Mistakenly I expressed my feelings towards her. I was completely emotionally vulnerable, I was expecting rejection but had a glimmer of hope. I kept saying ""The worse she can do is say No"" but that was not the case. What she instead did was block me completely on all platforms, copied all my messages and sent them to my fiance. I accessed my fiance's messages before she saw them and deleted everything and covered my tracks. 

I'm not a good person and I'm not doing the right thing. As the day pass now I feel nothing but pain and its all my fault. I know its all my fault. But why does it hurt so much. After that event I started having panic attacks every day. I feel nothing but anxiety, pain, and unhappiness every single day. I've talked to my friends about how I've been feeling but its hard to say everything. I started taking medication but even then its hard. It just feels like I'm trapped in this pain. I don't feel suicidal, but soaking this all in feels like I'm dying. Why does this feeling hurt so much?

I cant tell my fiance how I feel or anything that happened its too much for me to handle and it will be too much for her to handle too.

I started this hoping I'd be able to tell my entire story in full with extreme detail but even now I cant muster up the will  to do so, but this is still more information than I've been able to express as of late.

,depression,"If you've never personally dealt with the feelings and thoughts of wanting to end your own life, you will never understand how intrusive and painful they really are. Being suicidal and just being depressed, in my experience personally, are two completely different things. Being depressed makes you tired and you feel like you cant do anything, but once you force yourself to do it and be productive, that depressed feeling subsides for a while. But when you're suicidal on top of it, it's like you have a dark presence following you at all times whispering in your ear how pathetic and worthless you are all throughout the day. Someone could scream in your face that they love you and care for you but those suicidal thoughts will twist it and make you believe they are lying. You become so overwhelmed by the feeling of absolute certainty that you mean nothing to everyone and they would be better off without you that it just becomes reality. How does this explain how suicide isnt selfish? I'm sure countless people on here have heard the ""you have so much to live for!"" Or my personal favorite, ""you have nothing to be depressed about. Lifes hard for everyone!"" lines over and over again. It's easy to tell someone that and have good intentions to it, but in the process of doing so, you are telling that person that they have no reason to feel the way they do, enforcing the idea that they dont mean anything and that they arent important. To a suicidal person, ending their own lives is like solving a life long problem for everyone. They feel like nobody will ever be truly happy unless they are gone, and that's honestly one of the most selfless things a person could ever think. Most people think it's selfish because you're only spreading your pain onto someone else, but really, they already think they're causing you pain just by being alive and they dont want to hurt you anymore. No, I do not think anyone should feel like they should ever end their lives, but for those that suffer from it or have tried/ succeeded, they are some of the most selfless people to only want to make other people happy. I do not condone suicide and if you can get help, then please do so. But if you're dealing with suicidal thoughts and or tendencies, you are not selfish and how you feel is completely valid and you deserve to be as happy as everyone else.

January of 2019 - Too much stress, felt emotional over the past, barely sleeping, overdosing (Taking 3x my Antidepressants to cope), and a bottle of wine, unleashed all hell, I blacked out and woke up psychotic... This is my first episode of psychosis ever

This is a girl who I been talking to for a while and she agreed to go on a date with me. When I had my psychosis, apparently (I can barely remember) I messaged her bunch of stuff... She got scared and confused and told my sister about it... I had delusions that my phone was hacked by a group of people telling me to do things and giving me hints through app notifications.... so I ended up at my moms house asking my sister where the girl is cause I thought she was taking hostage by my sister... I remember leaving and coming back... Then I got taking by cops to 
The mental hospital..

I was there for a month and all that time I believed in the delusions because it was sooooo surreal. I was even getting friends to message her things while I was in the hospital. The doctors told me that she doesn't want me trying to get people to message her or for me to message her. She &amp; her mom, and my sister and my mom came to the hospital to visit me but I was sure it wouldn't end well and it was a bad first impression for the mom..so I told the doctors that I don't want to see them(I still had delusions, wasn't thinking straight but looking back I'm sure it wouldn't end well.. at least I doubt it) I didn't even realize the intensity of everything that happened and that what I was experiencing were all delusions until almost a month after I got out of the hospital

To make matters worse... She's my sister's best friend so I wanted to make sure I treated her well and that things would go smoothly.. obviously a lot of relationships don't last and I didn't anticipate it to last that long but when it ended, I wanted it to end really nicely... But things couldn't even go that far.. all we did was talk and it was obvious we were both into each other .. and we agreed to go out together... Then hell came knocking at my door

If she wasn't my sister's best friend, if I wasn't actually into her, if she wasn't 3 years younger than me, if she didn't take a chance in breaking that ""invisible barrier""(idk how my friend will feel about me getting with her brother and hopefully this doesn't end bad) to get with me .. then it wouldn't hurt so fucking bad.. it ended in the worse possible way which I never imagined

I Scared her, her mom got involved, I almost ruined my sister's friendship with her, I heard I made her cry multiple times... Like fuckkkk

At least my sister and her are still friends, she's visited our house multiple times since the whole ordeal but I have sooo much shame, embarrassment, self hate and I don't want to make her uncomfortable, scared or cry so I just hide and make sure I'm not seen. It's so bad I had to stop a game of chess with my uncle and run downstairs because she was about to step in the house

Right now I feel really suicidal. And severely depressed. My brain is pounding...im trying to get myself together it's been a 
Year but thinking about it still fucks me up.. lately I been trying to delve deeper into what happened to find peace but at the same time I tend to delve too deep into an abyss of pain and bad memories.. and I've been in cognitive decline with the aftermath of the psychosis and prescribed drugs which I'm off now and I've been trying to run away and act like It never happened but trying to understand more, find peace, be more open with my counselor has made me reflect deeper even tho it's been a year but in doing so I tend to get wrecked 

Before my psychosis happened I was already sufferring from chronic major depression, was often nihilistic but felt like things were going to get  at least a little bit better. Then hell happened.
Now I'm scared of being way more metaphorically dead inside, I'm scared of having little meaning in life.. 
I Scared that all this pain is going to make me soulless
I just hate how I'm so damaged 

Sorry Im pretty much crying out for help rn and advice so I'm kinda rambling and not being concise

The fact that there's pretty much 0-2% chance (lmao who am I kidding, it's next to impossible, probably the same chances of me turning into a dragon right now: 0.000%) now that we'll ever get to actually date each other after all that happened fucks with me and it's not like im her ex , we were just about to go on our first date.. I'm fucked over what never got to be.. 

Sorry this is way too long

It went on like this for 7 straight months until one day I decided enough was enough I felt like nobody cared about me I felt there was no way out.  I had over 10k in debt just from the last month of using.  I had no friend or family member I felt I could talk to I just wanted it all to end. So one night I planned on overdosing on fentanyl and about an hour before I was going to do it randomly my mom knocked on my door and asked what was wrong she said she could tell I wasn’t myself, at that point I broke down crying and explained to her as best I could what was going on. From that point I got on suboxone, klonopin, trintellix, and methylfolate for the past 5 or so months and started meeting with a therapist here and there and being more open with my parents even though we don’t live together.  Sorry for the long post just wanted to let those who have been through it or are going through it. It will always get better just give it time and a little hope.&lt;/p&gt;

,depression,"Hello,

I have been on fluvoxamine since I was probably 13. I was really depressed because I had a bad childhood. I would stay in my room 24/7 and play video games 12 hours a day. I wouldn’t shower and I had a couple feet high pile of dishes next to my computer. My floor was covered in dirty laundry. I ate, slept, and stayed in my room all the time for months. (I was “homeschooled”)I even cut my hair down very short (I am a girl) so that i wouldn’t have to deal with it. I tried to tell my mom multiple times that I thought  I was depressed but she would only say that I was faking it. 

I tried to commit suicide a couple months of feeling that way. Needless to say, it was unsuccessful. Honestly, I don’t really remember much about how I was feeling. I wonder if it was a cry for help.

Either way, that got my moms attention so she took me to a psychiatrist who prescribed me fluvoxamine.

I have since left my family house (I am now 18) and feel like a brand new person. I have titrated off of Luvox and now I am getting really emotional. Things that never would have made me jealous and angry before are constantly triggering. I open up the news on my phone and I start bawling (like actually crying) I have been experiencing extreme mood swings.

I wonder if it was because my parents never taught me how to handle my emotions and now that I don’t have them to punish me when I overreact, I am going off the rails. Or maybe this is depression but with different symptoms? I am wondering if I need to go back on it.

Thank you in advance !

,depression,"I'm currently about to enter my Adult phase of life, and I don't know how I feel.

I was born with a silver spoon in my mouth, I have no reason to be ungrateful, depressed, or anxious, and yet I feel constantly tired, drained, annoyed, and emotionally numbed to everyday events.

I started to lose motivation when I realized studying my hardest wasn't getting me the results I wanted, and people never took my effort into account, when looking at my grades. Always dictating I can do better. Eventually, people had expectations, I lost the feeling of motivation when working towards a goal when there is no sense of accomplishment in doing it when it's a regular thing that happens and people expect it from you. People don't recognise your efforts and you fade out of peoples view.

I was bullied for a few years, I've always been timid, and kind towards people, it's how I was raised. People took advantage of that and made a period of my life unbearable. I was naive and gullible, I admit. Eventually, it stopped, but I was in a phase of Social Awkwardness, where I forgot how to socialise properly. After being bullied for so long, I forgot how to socialise normally, without the risk of being laughed at, or knowing another's ulterior motives.

Eventually, I stopped seeking validation for my efforts, but instead, acknowledgement of my existence. I feel like a background character in everyone's life. Any conversation I'm in leaves no space for me to communicate. If I try I'm alienated. I feel anxious. I just want to be included, and feel like I'm someone as well.

It doesn't help that I'm Overweight and constantly anxious about my image. (Hypothyroidism)  
I've never had a crush, and as far as I know, I might even be Asexual. I see no reason to improve myself, and when I do, I feel no motivation to do so.

I'm about to graduate high school but I've made no memorable memories, a big group of friends, or anything of the like.

If anything, the only thing about me that's changed, is I've recently stopped seeking acknowledgement as well. I don't have the motivation to continue. I've become sarcastic, closed, and somewhat emotionally numb. My tolerance for people is at an all-time low. And I feel like shit because I have no reason to feel like this. My parents have done the best they can to provide for me. And I feel like an ungrateful piece of shit for feeling this way.

Quarantine has put me 7 weeks behind work, and with my exams only weeks away, I'm stressed, and yet, I can't even bring myself to work. Suicide and self-harm have never crossed my mind, and for that I'm thankful. But, I just don't feel happy.

,depression,"In the past, I really struggled with mental health issues. 7th grade till freshman year of college, I struggled to make many meaningful relationships, particularly in high school. I went to a whole new school with very high expectations and very harsh students. I encountered either being completely ignored or being told ""no one would care if you died"" so I took a nose dive and often had suicidal thoughts. At this same time, my parents were quite busy as my grandmother was in the hospital and died my freshman year of high school. Following that, my grandfather was in and out of the hospital. Due to this, it was alot of stress on them and we spent alot of time driving back and forth to help and even after he passed, we still had to go and clean out the house. Also in 2014, a close friend of my died so that definitely didn't help with my mental health as she died far too young and I wish I had been better to her in the end. I hated myself and I had no one to talk to about it, especially with mental health stigmas by my family. My parents also are very conservative and critical so even general topics were hard to have with them. Even at the first year of college, I felt out of place and did not know what to do. 

But the last two years of it have honestly been the best two years of my life. I made genuine friends, found courses and activities I liked, and even found a boyfriend who treats me well. I had gotten away from my toxic family dynamic and even got therapy through the university to allow me to work through certain issues. I got a bunny who helps with my feelings and gave me a thing to snuggle on harder nights. Everything was going really well, I felt happy and had a set schedule that left not a ton of time to just sit around and overthink. 

But then the virus hit. My friends all dispersed back home and my professors went away. I keep in touch with my friends but it's not the same. I'm still in my apartment and my roommate isn't exceptionally social so I spend a lot of days in quiet in my room. My boyfriend has been busy and at home and have occasionally made a trip to him but its an hour drive and I have a pet who needs to be let out fairly regularly and not a fan of cars. This spring was actually my last semester. I knew I was going to be sad but this just made it worse. I don't get a graduation, I don't get to say goodbye to all of my classmates or professors, don't get to say goodbye to the campus. These past 3 months have just been a daze. I don't know what has happened in all this time. 

Now that I'm graduated, I need to find a job. I had to applied to some internships but they were pretty much all cancelled (or I just didn't get in). I just am struggling to do this task. I don't want to leave it all, especially on this note. I wake up, do basic tasks and my one summer class, but then basically blankly watch videos or zone out all day. Most of the places are pretty far away so I'll almost certainly be leaving it. I know I need to do this but especially with how everything is still closed, I'm struggling.

I have been finding myself just not motivated to work, I will stare at the screen, nap, clean do anything but what I actually need to be doing. I then get down on myself about not doing the work and not being motivated which causes me to have an almost panic like response which further leads me to just not doing what I need to do. The more I fall behind, the worse it all gets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#39;t know whats going on with me, why I am so distracted. I am so aware of what I need to do but just cannot get my shit together to do it. It&amp;#39;s a cycle that is making me spiral and I just want to stop.   &lt;/p&gt;

,depression,"I have plenty of experiences with people treating me worse than dirt. My family treats me as if I am inferior. My co workers at my old job mocked and made fun of me until I quit.

I have come to understand that life simply isn't for everyone more than most. If you don't have social skills, talents, intelligence or something that makes you stand out you will have a hard time.

 People always say that  they aren't judgmental but it is the entire basis on how they choose who to be friends with. It is all about wether or not you are worthy of someone's attention rather than simply being a decent person. You could be a saint and if you had something that made you inferior most of society would treat you like a hindrance.

 Living with these realizations is nothing but suffering. I have no love of life. The periods that were supposed to be the greatest moments of my life were shit. Growing up I was friendless. In high school I was an outcast. I failed out of college due to my depression. My twenties so far have been an absolute waste. I have accomplished nothing. Relationships, friendships, sex, financial independence, partying, life accomplishments, etc, I have no experience with. what were supposedly the highlights of my twenties I  spent in a haze of depression and self loathing. My greatest experiance during my twenties was discovering alcohol.

Humanity is a joke. We supposedly are taught to treasure life but treat those who don't deserve it like trash. It's depressing seeing post on the internet that talk about how the disabled should be euthanized. Where is that so called mantra that ""all life is sacred""? Especially when we do things like constantly killing minorities due to racism and strap bombs to kids in the name of religion.

Suicide may be frowned upon but it seems like a damn good way to escape this bullshit.

I try to play Video games and get insanely good at it, i get yelled at. I was in the top 500 in leaderboards for Call of Duty. 

I try to play Sports and ran 5-6 minute miles, nope can’t try that either. I need to focus on school and education... my weakest point... 

I try being into cars, no support for a driver’s license and and behind on everything in life. Can’t work for a dream car or mods for A car.

I have a little brother, that i wasn’t the greatest too because of my pent up frustration but am now working on being better for him, also has some sort of depression. My family just expects him to do homework and they leave him alone. He was never taught why he should do things and that doing/not doing things has consequences. So they turn to me to help. Sure I help but it interferes with my life and interests. And because of that, I get yelled at. 

I have a very hard time expressing emotions. Was never allowed to emote but i have my lovely girlfriend to help me with that. The only thing is that i love my alone time. From middle school to Senior year of high school, i never had any privacy in my life. It frustrates the fuck out me. I just wanted to get excited playing games with some friends in my own privacy with my door closed.

From middle school to Senior year, i was forced to go to an after school program to focus on education, i just wanted to do the bare minimum and go to a community college then transfer to another college. All those years wasted on nothing. 

I really don’t care about what happened in Middle and High school. What bothers me more is that I didn’t have my own choice. How am i suppose to learn if i’m able to make my own choices. or better yet. EXPLAIN THE CONSEQUENCES. 

Was never able to join any school clubs, never able to choose my own clothing and my parents did. and when I didn’t wear them. I get yelled at. The fuck? 

About the clubs, My friends get to go to a decent amount of conventions and I missed out on all of them because school is so fucking important. 

Why do i even try? 

I’m so behind on life because what was forced on me and what i lost because of a one minded path that was set for me. 

Why is it people can make money playing video games and I wasn’t. Why is it that people can get the title of Athlete and make money from running. Why is it that people can make money from having a great personality/persona. Why is it that I can’t have self expression without someone complaining. Why is it that people have the ability to choose anything for themselves. Why is it that I was told but never taught. 

Why is it that my childhood friends, that are younger than me, are so much more successful because of better parenting. Life is a fucking gamble and I want a reset. Honestly. Only thing that drives me is my girlfriend. I just want a handout. Give me a job. I don’t care if it’s hard, easy, whatever. Just give me a foundation to build off of. There’s so many things I’m interested in. Computers, movies, video games, sports but I don’t have a starting point anymore. I’m 22 and I’m very lost and stuck. No license, no degree, and only my girlfriend is my only supporter who knows any of this. 

Why is it that people are able to buy some sneakers and make money off of it but i was shamed for spending money on shoes. My first sneaker sale, i made 600$ as a HIGH SCHOOLER. Like that’s A LOT of fucking money and i get shamed for it. I was never taught to save. Just told. I was never taught about stocks or investing but my friend was. What shitty luck do I have.

I&amp;#39;ve seen &lt;del&gt;worse&lt;/del&gt; shit artists and programmers get hired. I&amp;#39;ve seen people get hired only because they knew someone. I&amp;#39;ve always done well at school and have done so much to improve my art/design/coding skills outside of school. Everyone I know from all walks of life from childhood to grad school is somewhere or has something or someone and I&amp;#39;m nowhere.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The last person I was close to was in high school. I&amp;#39;m single, I have no friends, no one to talk to. I don&amp;#39;t want to talk to anyone. I&amp;#39;m angry and bitter all the time. I give up.&lt;/p&gt;

Depression isnt a phase it is a serious thing, and you cant just get over it. Just because you dont think we have a reason to feel depressed doesnt mean we dont it's just something yall cant understand and you refuse to listen to us. You tell us that its gonna be ok but you gotta understand we dont always know that, to us when we have problem after problem happening when every time we feel happy and someone takes it away we blame ourselves for trying to be happy saying it's our fault, saying it's not doesnt help. You try to say we need therapy and medicine but the thing is that doesnt always help and it wont ever cure it it just numbs us to everything including the moments we really feel happy. We dont need you questioning our reason for feeling what we do nor do we need you to deny our feelings.  Yall have to understand depression has no cure its something that eats away at us every second of every day until we eventually leave this shitty world. Instead of saying our feelings arent real or justified why not listen to us and how we feel be there for us at our worst and make our happy moments as good as they possibly can be.

Im 18 and i have memories of depression from when I was 4 years old.

It’s uniquely torturous. 

I want help. I need professional help. My mental health is beyond fucked, I’m surprised people don’t see it just by looking at me. I dont want to give up anymore of my life to this fucked up ailment. Meditation definitely works but the brain is conditioned to love the familiar and fear change.

,depression,"When I was 16 me and my mom moved into a new house. I had school the next day but didn’t go because I just didn’t want to, I just stayed home and this went on for a week before the school called my mom and said “Your son never showed up to school”.
Mom was mad and decided to not let me go anymore. I was so happy. I hated school. Then one day my mom comes home from work and says “Remember you telling me you feel like your depressed?” I said “Yeah why” she said “Here take this everyday”. It was an antidepressant called Pristiq. I took it everyday because I really thought I was depressed. 
   About a week and a half later I was just sitting on my bed in my room watching tv. Out of nowhere I looked at my wall and my entire mental mind changed. There was no cause. No nothing. I got up out of my bed and was walking back and forth in my room holding my head with both hands clinching my hair. And told myself I would never take another antidepressant again because I thought that’s what caused it.
   Actual depression started happening, not the depression I thought I had. No. No.. this was real. Immediately waves of suicidal thoughts began uncontrollably. Over and over. It didn’t stop. My mind was a prison and I was the prisoner. 
   How does this happen? No cause, just uncontrollable severe depression that doesn’t stop. I began to have a plan if this didn’t stop in two weeks I was gonna kill myself. How does one be happy and love life then in a second it all turns upside down? 
  After two weeks it didn’t stop and every second that I was awake I wanted to die. But, I had hope because I was moving back in with my dad because now I’m thinking it was the house causing this depression. One month later I moved back in with my dad. I put the fakest smile on my face when I seen him. But we hugged and I went to sleep because I had school the next day and I actually wanted to go, I thought being around my friends would put my mind back into place. 
   Oh was I wrong. I wasn’t myself anymore, I completely lost the ability to have a sense of humor. I lost my personality and turned into someone else. I lost my motivation to even socialize anymore.
   I was amazed that I was only 16 and my life was already over. My grades dropped really far and my dad was angry. But I never told him or anybody what I was going through. I knew I had a mental disorder but I still to this day don’t know what it is. 
   And guess what? It’s 5 years later. I’m 21. I graduated high school because of hope. I graduated the Army because of hope and went on to be the best Private First Class I could be.
   I did it. I have two diplomas because I never stopped. But I still go through it everyday. As soon as I wake up I have thoughts of suicide. Everyday I’m really depressed, but it’s not as bad as it was. It has lessened a little bit and I’m thankful for that. I know what real depression is and it’s the worst kind of pain in this world.

I know of the show but was never into it at all. For some reason I just decided to watch it to the end.

For the past few months things have just been getting progressively worse for me, just when I've gotten into a new job and yet my work performance is just dropping like mad. I don't know how else I can explain this but I've been making so much stupid mistakes at work it's ridiculous. 

It's a supposedly straightforward routine job (though not really up my alley), but yet I manage to screw up even over the simplest kind of tasks just cause it had slipped my mind. And it's honestly kind of difficult to feel justified to be upset over all these because during such a period, at least I still have a job and I should be thankful for that.

I've been diagnosed with mild anxiety before but at this point I feel like it's definitely way more than that. It's being worried pretty much everyday when you're going to make the next mistake then when it happens I just cry and get sad over it. The vicious cycle just keeps going.

I know I'm not supposed to self diagnose but it does feel like there's some sort of depression + anxiety. I won't be surprised if that's the actual case cause well aren't they the best of friends. I've also had an episode of sorts where I made a rather big mistake that caused me to be overwhelmed and freaking out, but after that was over I just completely lost the motivation to do anything else and basically did nothing much for the next 2 days and ended up calling a hotline on the third.

,depression,"Before I got really depressed, I used to be kind of an overachiever at school getting mostly straight As and even skipping 6th grade. My last really good year in terms of academic achievement was when I was in 11th grade in 2017 and I got straight As and A*s in every subject. I was already dealing with mild depression and social anxiety at that point, but then it really started kicking in. It became so bad that I dropped out of school a couple of months before I would have graduated in early 2018. 

After that I basically spent half a year in bed at my father‘s house feeling absolutely hopeless. Then I did 3 months of inpatient treatment followed by 3 months of treatment at a day clinic. In 2019 I decided to go back to school and finish my Abitur (the German high school diploma). However, my loneliness and depression made it absolutely impossible to do any studying at all. Yesterday I received the grades for my written final exams. I still managed to get an A in math, a B+ in German and a B in biology even though I was pretty much unable to do any studying for it. However, in history I‘ve now got a fucking D- and it just feels like a fucking punch in the gut. 

I‘m just absolutely devastated how badly depression has impacted my academic success. I mean, I‘m already fucking 20 now and I‘m only now about to finish high school with disappointing results (when applying my normal standards). All my “friends” (I’m using scare quotes because I actually haven’t had any close friendships since kindergarten) from middle school have long started university while it just feels like my life is going absolutely nowhere.

,depression,"For context: I’m a millennial who was already struggling with anxiety, depression, and ADHD before the pandemic hit. I graduated with a masters degree in public health in Jan 2019 with mountains of debt, and ironically have never been able to find a job, and when I did get a job offer it was never over $18 an hour...I’ve tried and tried and tried again but I still manage to always came up short. I soon realized that the American dream is dead. It died with my parents generation. So yeah, that sucks already. 

So now, We’re in the midst of an uncontrolled pandemic that’s killed over 112,000 Americans in 3 months so far, racial protests, toxic politics, and an economic recession that is bound to become a depression in no time. States and counties are opening up despite public health warnings and predictions that ANOTHER 100,000 could die from coronavirus before September. 

So, I mean what the fuck do we all have to look forward to? Really. All the mental health experts say is your generic, “limit your news intake”, “create a routine/schedule!” or, “remind yourself that this pandemic is only temporary”. With all due respect, I find all that advice useless. How am I supposed to remain optimistic of my future when nearly every local organization is being defunded (meaning less hiring for cities &amp; counties), but somehow wallstreets numbers are somehow doing great...go figure. 

Not to be bleak, but shit is looking pretty hopeless at this point, especially for millennials who’ve already inherited a trash economy with stagnant wages, no personal wealth, and lots of student loan debt with no way of paying it back. But who knows, maybe I’m just overreacting? I’m wondering what others think about this situation. What are your honest feelings about this batshit crazy year we’ve been experiencing. And what are you hopeful for, if anything. 

Thank you for listening. I just needed to rant. the past 2 weeks have been absolute torture. Im sure I’m not alone in feeling this way. It sucks but we’re all suffering together.

I graduated with a masters degree in public health in Jan 2019 with mountains of debt, and ironically have never been able to find a job, and when I did get a job offer it was never over $18 an hour...I’ve tried and tried and tried again but I still manage to always came up short. I soon realized that the American dream is dead. It died with my parents generation. So yeah, that sucks already. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So now, We’re in the midst of an uncontrolled pandemic that’s killed over 112,000 Americans in 3 months so far, racial protests, toxic politics, and an economic recession that is bound to become a depression in no time. States and counties are opening up despite public health warnings and predictions that ANOTHER 100,000 could die from coronavirus before September. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, I mean what the fuck do we all have to look forward to? Really.

,depression,"I have had two depressive episodes that each lasted for around a year... though not being on antidepressants at the moment, I have always been having suicidal thoughts on and off, especially when life gets rough and I get really stressed out and overwhelmed.  My boyfriend, on the other hand, never experienced this level of darkness his entire life.  

Last night, we were both exhausted after work, and argued over something not so important (of course it felt very important then).  We argued, we talked, and I felt very overwhelmed and upset that I had a small breakdown - curling up into a ball and cried/hyperventilated/shivered for idk how long.  

He left the room to supposedly go shower.  I heard the metal gate of our apartment, then the gate to the rooftop (we live on the top floor of the apartment building). 

I was still recovering from my breakdown/panic attack/something, but I crawled up and went out to check - nobody was in the apartment. It was dark. 

I felt this panic inside me, so I grabbed the keys and went up to the roof - he was there. 

His phone and his keys were on the floor.  He was standing there leaning towards the fence.  He didn’t hear me until I got closer.  He asked what was I doing there.  I asked him back.  He said he was thinking.  I knew that look. and that “reason”.  

Then I basically dragged him back into the staircase, down to our floor, into our room.  I started brushing my teeth, and placed a toothbrush with toothpaste into his hands.  He started to sob.  I washed the toothbrush for him, put him in bed, and handed him a glass of water. 

He struggled to talk.  After some time, he eventually told me why he was on the roof.  He kept apologizing for it, saying it was stupid and selfish.  I told him it wasn’t stupid, it wasn’t selfish, it was nothing to be ashamed of.  He was very much in shock about how he had these thoughts at all.  He’s never ever had these ideas ever in his life.   We talked a little bit about how I used to deal with these thoughts, and some other stuff I can’t really remember clearly. 

We eventually went to sleep. 

This morning when I woke up, all I could think of was how I exposed him to this level of darkness that he’s never encountered before.  I cannot face the fact that, as much as he thanks me for bringing him back down from the roof, I was the one who put him there in the first place. I was just making up in the slightest possible way for what I’ve done.  I brought this darkness into his life.  Then I put Imagine Dragon’s “Demons” on repeat.

I really do want to get a rabbit because it will give me motivation and purpose to get up in the morning to take care of it. I've been feeling like there's no purpose in life, well, for a while now, but having a rabbit would give me a chance to be something important to something. But, I don't want my rabbit to suffer like how I do with second-hand smoke from my dad and everything. It's espically bad for them since even a bit of smoke that touches their skin will eventually be licked and into its body since they clean themselves. I think it's selfish for me to get a rabbit if they'll only suffer. But if I do get one, I hope to give it unconditional love and attention that will make it worth while. But, should I? My dad smokes alot, not sure how many packs/ cigarettes a day, but I can't even go to the kitchen 60% of the time since he's actively smoking when I do. My room in which I'm thinking of housing my rabbit if I do decide to get one doesnt get hit by smoke alot. Sometimes I just get a small whiff or if my window is open, I can smell alot at times. I can't ask my dad to stop smoking because it's something we never talked about. It's like having a conversation with your dad about sex... it's weird and uncomfortable. Anyways, he wouldn't stop since he's clearly addicted and care more about his habits than about me or put effort into fixing them. I thought about showing him the rabbit I've considered to adopt, so maybe he would consider lessening his smoke. I know this won't work because we had a golden retriever when I was around 4-5 and he would constantly smell the cigarette smoke since he was put in the backyard for most of his life.(He smokes near the backyard window from the inside of his house) Apparently, from what I heard from my brother, my golden retriver had a swarm of flies on his nose where it was also bleeding. I don't know if that is related to the smoke or not, but all I'm saying is that my dad doesn't really seem to care. I know having a pet would really make me happy since I'm really lonely and hopeless.(I wont get in depth about why since that's off-topic) but anyways, is there ways where I can filter out smoke from my room or where it wouldn't touch my rabbit?

,depression,"The title says it all. I never had a girlfriend or been in a relationship in 20 years. I even never kissed a girl before the end of 2019. I don't know what the fuck is wrong with me.

Not to be narcissistic but I look pretty good, far above average imo and several people told me that before. I have a lot of friends, I'm someone really sociable, very smart, funny guy and a lot of things to say. Social skills have never been an issue but I don't know what the fuck is wrong with me when it comes to intimate relationships. I just hate meeting someone with the only purpose to hook up, I like when it's natural, without any ideas at the beginning. But even then I'm not able to fckin make something out of it.

I gained a lot of confidence when I went to America for half a year in 2019. I realized that I could have pretty much success with girl but yeah, now I'm back in my country and I feel like things don't move. I'm not even able to get a date with someone. There was that super duper hot chick from my high-school who liked 3 of my ig pics. I texted her, asking her if she'd like to go out with me once the quarantine is over and she was really eager about it and told me yes. She's been liking all my tweets and sending me pics for the past weeks. But every time I asked her for a date she's always been busy. Now she doesn't send me any pics anymore since 3 weeks, doesn't text me or whatever. I just don't understand what the fuck I did wrong. I feel like I've been acting super naturally, talking to her one day from another, but as usually nothing happened and I guess my chances are close to 0 (she left me on read) and I didn't even spam her or text her everyday or whatever. 

Back to life where not a single girl is interested in me (well there have been several girls interested in me in the past but I had a lack of self confidence back then and as always, didn't know how to act).

There is only one girl with who I've felt really fine. Like really. And she sees me as someone really special too. It's that girl I met when I was abroad. I met her by luck at an event back then, and we kept contact as well as with her group of friends. I felt so good when I was with her, she was the best side of me. We always had super interesting topics and we event went to a huge festival together. Like I honestly never felt that before with a girl, everything was just so natural and fluid. I saw her pretty much every week end, and we made such an amazing duo. 

But now I'm back in my country and I'm a loser again. I know that I count a lot for her but we didn't hook up for several reasons (me leaving soon, she still had feelings for her ex, etc...). She's dating another guy now, and it makes me feel even worse and I'm getting a bit angry. I'm just such a loser. Of course getting in a relationship isn't a problem for such a beautiful girl. I just hope that I'll have my change again when I'll be back the her place next year.

I don't know what the fuck is wrong is me. Why can't I just have luck with girl? I feel really alone sometimes. I see a lot of my friends all the time, but when I'm back at my apartment I always feel really lonely and wish I had a gf to speak to, cook something or just have fun with or whatever.

,depression,"I am from Algeria, north Africa. For people who never heard of us, it's a big country with a lot natural ressources, but also a lot of extremely corrupt leaders who are sucking the country dry, Algeria rank among the most corrupt countries in the world.

People are poor, not extreme poverty in general, but we have that too in isolated rural area. Islam gangrened every aspect of Algerien life, people are going crazy. There are bearded guys and niqab women (it look like a burka) everywhere, and they attract every day more young people that are completely desperate with no hope for a better future.

And me in the middle.

I'm a 30 year old man. And i have spent the last 7 years struggling to make something of my life. After useless Study. Algerian universities are amongst the worst in the world, my diploma is worth nothing, we have millions of young people with a university degree who can barely structure a complex sentence. I educated myself alone where i self taught French, English and critical thinking (it shows in my poor wording and spelling mistakes).

I liberated myself from the toxic destructive religion that is islam and decided to build a better life.

(For muslim redditers reading this, please don't lecture me about how your religion is peaceful and beautiful, keep you magic guy in the sky for your self, i'm fed up with him. thank you)

But all my effort were vain.

After my graduation, i've looked for a job for more than 2 years with no success, then i decided three years ago to become an entrepreneur, three years later and after a half-dozen of failed business ideas. Still didn't move by an inch.

I'm stuck, Algeria is as i said, corrupt to the core, you can't work, because there are no jobs. It's that simple.

Forget entrepreneurship, bank won't lend you money, there are no raw materials, no well trained workforce so i have to do everything myself, plus our ruling class import cheap garbage goods and export petro-dollars, so much so that we have zero industry, in virtually every imaginable area.

at 30, i'm just tired, i can't keep doing this for long, working really really hard with no result and no hope for things to get better.

I struggle to trust being happy because previous experiences have shown that is isnt worth it. My only goal is to either die or not be depressed. I am on the edge of killing myself nearly every night. I feel like i need to kill myself. I really want to kill myself. Imagining killing myself is some of the only excitement I&amp;#39;ve had for something in years. I&amp;#39;ve tried overdosing and it did not work. I&amp;#39;ve used scissors to cut into my wrist to try get an artery. I&amp;#39;ve overdosed twice. Lately I have been feeling worse than usual. The only happy thing in my life are my plants. I cry when I think of them dying once im not here to take care of them.&lt;/p&gt;

,depression,"been a long time lurker dealing with depression and ptsd and i've been in a weird head space since last august and i'll explain. just need to talk to someone/anyone about it since i haven't pushed myself to get therapy.

august of 2019 i went to hawaii for a 4 day trip with 2 of my best friends. the second day were were there was when a lot of shit happened. we were body surfing at one of their beaches for a good hour and a half straight. after getting slammed we took a 15-20 min breather then decided to go back in the water. the waves were a lot dangerous and intense by the second time we went in. i am not a strong swimmer at all but my friends were so they were further out than me. after only 10 mins or so i was already pulled out far enough from shore to try and make an attempt to swim or walk back. the water height was at my chin and that's when i started to panic. i jumped and yelled for one of my friends and by the time i started to go back down, a 8 ft wave hit me and i was under for what felt like an eternity. it was realistically only a good 6 or 8 seconds of fighting to get oxygen into my body but everytime i thought i was above the surface, i was just inhaling a stupid amount of ocean water. by the time my friends got to me, i was already out.

if you wanna know what it's like, it's like your asleep but not dreaming. i felt myself give up and allowed myself to let go. it was just black. didn't feel a thing. then 19 hours later i woke up.

when i got to shore, there's was 2 lifeguards that started to do CPR on me. i didn't have a pulse for a good 5 minutes until the paramedics came and defibrillated me. they rushed me to the ICU where i had a breathing tube inserted for 14 hours then i eventually woke up.

drowning, solid 1/10 experience. don't recommend it a whole lot. also got sunburnt and that wasn't very nice either.

i don't know how to process everything that happened. i still don't after all of these months that has passed. i've had terrible nightmares, daily flashbacks, and i've just felt stuck more than anything. just wanted to say thank every single one of you for being here and thank you for letting me vent. i'm doing okay, it's just one day at a time. it'll get worse before it gets better.",t2_gy0p4,False,,0,False,hi everyone.,[],r/depression,False,0,,0,,False,t3_h0wa99,False,dark,0.76,,public,2,0,{},,False,[],,False,False,,{},,False,2,,False,,False,,[],{},,True,,1591898071.0,text,0,,,text,self.depression,False,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;been a long time lurker dealing with depression and ptsd and i&amp;#39;ve been in a weird head space since last august and i&amp;#39;ll explain. just need to talk to someone/anyone about it since i haven&amp;#39;t pushed myself to get therapy.&lt;/p&gt;

,depression,"Hello, im not sure anyone here give a flying f about my story but here it goes,

When i was a child i had rage and depression issues, parents dint know how to cope with me and i believe they made it worse by belittle me and making fun of my mental illness.

I am also a victic of severe physical and emotional abuse by my parents,

i drop out of school when i was 14, my dad send me to work for my uncle who is a smuggler and he gave me alot of drugs such as ecstasy , weed and lsd etc.

fast forward 8 years  later( 22 years old) I started dating this girl Jeanette and i joined my dads company which does packaging and i have a great success in this career.

it was a constant struggle being in a relationship with her , she was a victim of sexual abuse by her brother she was young and because of that she have no clear boundaries with guys, i always try to show her that emotional dependency on other guys will lead to intimate connection, dating her made me felt so insecure because i am the 19th guy she has been with. i also caught her sexting guys i dont know and texing my friends for emotional support whenever we fight.

I raised my hands againts her many times because of my jealousy and because of that, whenever we had argument she would bring up the fact that i hurt her physically and make me feel so guilty like a monster.

I still tried my best to salvage the relationship regardless of our toxic relationship...

We were trying to build a life together until the pandemic happened, the isolation revealed my true self and bring out the inner child of me with massive depression and anger, i felt on the edge most of the time at home.

That is when she complained that i was always emotionally unavailable and she started talking to this guy called Lex, i saw her sharing photos of her to him, they know each other recently and i felt so insecure i called for a breakup, i regret and of course i try to chase her back only to find out that she is already staying over at his place on the following day.

It really sucks to see her move on just like that after being in a relationship together for 6 years.

This is a story of 2 broken people being in a relationship, i am now seeing a psychologist and trying to heal as much as possible, will i ever get better ?

Knowing that i  am not right in the head, should i ever get into another relationship ?

,depression,"(24 F) I've been depressed for as long as I could remember and was drinking heavily and doing drugs by the age of 15-18. My childhood consisted of being raised by my great grandmother because my mom was a single mom and always working multiple jobs. She would drink and I didn't like it. We weren't really close when I was small and she would beat me when I was ""bad"". The worst thing I remember is her splitting my lip and lots of blood dripping into my hands. She'd always hit me with belts or other things. No father figure until my mom married when I was 13 and we moved from California to Texas. Now our relationship is fine, but I see her same characteristics when I visit her. I try to make the best out of it and I help her out financially (she has never asked me for money or anything) because I appreciate everything she's done  It was hard to make friends in a new, small town in Texas and I got bullied because I'm a lesbian. I was hanging out with the wrong people who were the friends I made. I wanted to kill myself. In Texas, many people are not okay with it. Anyway, I hated school and when I was finishing high school I got my act together and joined the military (Navy). I served 5 years and through out those years I felt extremely alone. I felt depressed and wanted to die, but I didn't want to ruin my career and let it be known. Therefore, I NEVER told anybody I was depressed and having suicidal thoughts. I was obviously not using drugs anymore while in the military and completely quit alcohol from the day I left home until I separated from the military. 

I am now going to school and I'm typically stressed out. My first semester was the beginning of 2020 and I took 3 courses. English, Mathematics, and Art History. I stress myself out and I always feel like I'm going to fail. I did great though, I finished all my classes with 95-100%. It's now summer and I am in the middle of taking History and will be taking Anthropology in 2 weeks when my history course ends. Most days, I'm stressed and I bring myself down and I believe I'm an idiot and was surprised at how well I did my first semester and my professors even acknowledged it. 

However, most days I feel like there is no point in anything. I think everything would be better off if I was dead. What it is the point of breaking my head over school if I might fail? And if I don't? What's the point? Work and buy an expensive place just to die? All for what? I just want to go to sleep and not wake up. The only thing that holds me back is my great grandmother and my mom because I know she cares. 

I contacted a therapist and have been speaking with her for the past 2 months. I find it extremely useless and I hate having pointless conversations or getting asked the same things when I just want to be fine. I am not rude to her and appreciate her help, but I don't think therapy helps. She immediately came to the conclusion of anti depressants but I do not want to be numb. I rarely have an appetite, but force myself to eat because I've lost so much weight. I always feel tired during the day so I'm taking an iron vitamin, SAM-E vitamin D3, Omega 3's, and B Complex,  I've tried to read books and I feel like I could fix things and then everything goes back to the same shit. I also work out and that brings joy and helps me. I enjoy video games as well. I just forget everything when I'm doing my hobbies. 

I would appreciate it if anybody has anything they found helpful? Books? Exercises? Apps? Anything at this point. I'm honestly on the verge and I'm tired of holding on.

Background:  I’m currently taking an antidepressant and talking to a psychiatrist about a serotonin inhibitor. I’m working (well i should say I have a job, but we haven’t opened back up yet) and will be continuing college courses for the summer.

Hey guys. So I’ve been doing pretty horrible lately. Every morning I dread getting up and I feel heavy and angry all throughout the day. I try to be consistent with taking my medication at the same time every day, but since I’ve started waking up very late in the day (the 11:00 to 12:00 hours) I miss my designated morning window when i’m supposed to take it. Usually, at that point, i’ll just take it whenever I get up but I am extremely forgetful and very busy. Of course this doesn’t exactly help my mood either.

So for those who also take medication, how do you stay consistent? Any tips?

,depression,"I'm currently deleting all of my previous posts/comments on this sub since I didn't use a throwaway account as I didn't see a point, and I'm probably deleting this post soon. But long story short I moved away from my home country in November all the way to another continent and as a result became depressed + suicidal because of my homesickness and just missing my friends, relatives, everything back home in general. As well as dealing with rough arguments between me and my parents, and on top of that struggling so hard to find new friends while trying to move on from my old ones.

&amp;#x200B;

So a few days ago I decided I was going to overdose on pills. I had been planning it for months, even making sure to take them at night so that my parents wouldnt discover me until the next afternoon. What I didn't think of was ""what would happen if I suddenly regretted it and called the police"", which is exactly what happened. So I called the ambulance, woke up my parents (which was a nerve racking experience) and when the ambulance arrived they said that the pills I took wouldn't cause too much damage, but will cause lots of nausea and pain. I was disappointed that it wouldn't cause damage, as I still wasn't sure if I wanted to keep living at the time, but I was so disturbed by the fact that I'd have to vomit it all out.

&amp;#x200B;

This is the traumatizing part of the event. It's been giving me nightmares ever since it happened and everytime I think of it I stop everything I'm doing and just breathe really deeply. So after the ambulance left (since i had the choice to stay home or go to the hospital, which i chose to stay home) it was about 3 AM and that was when the vomiting began. I have always had a fear of vomiting, not a disgust just a straight up fear, so the first time I vomited that night I was shaking all over and hyperventilating. From 3 AM all the way to 2 PM, i vomited over and over and over again, i mustve done it at least 10 times that day.

&amp;#x200B;

For anyone who has never experienced vomiting this much before, imagine this: imagine lying on your bed with a burning sensation from your stomach all the way to your upper throat, not being able to talk because the vibrations would make you throw up, not being able to move because just the slightest movements would make you nauseous and throw up, not being able to eat or drink because of the fear of throwing up instantly, not even being able to sleep because your body would get uncomfortable lying in the same position so you move to left a bit causing you to throw up again. It was so much torture both mentally and physically to the point where I genuinely thought that the pills had actually killed me and that this is my personal hell - just painful, endless vomiting all night and all morning, begging my parents to make it stop, who were staring at me wishing they could help in some way just so i could stop suffering. I even tried to knock myself unconscious just so that I didn't have to stay awake through all the pain. My hands are shaking just typing about this again.

&amp;#x200B;

Eventually at 2 PM the vomiting stopped. My dad decided it was time to take me to the hospital as I had just started throwing up dark brownish liquid, which was different than the previous ones. After that it wasn't as bad anymore. I was being crushed by the guilt of making my mom cry, my dad and 18yo sister sleep deprived as they had to watch over me as I tried to sleep, but physically speaking I wasnt suffering anymore. I couldn't walk as I was too nauseous + shaky so I had to be carried in a wheelchair, and the next 6 hours consisted of taking a blood test and waiting for a psychologist to arrive as we were in an emergency room and there weren't many around.

&amp;#x200B;

It's been a few days since this happened, thankfully my parents aren't treating me harshly about it but are helping me move on, which makes me feel even more guilty as I should be helping them move on. But other than that I'm still struggling with my friendships, and now the trauma from this event.

&amp;#x200B;

I know depression is a bitch to deal with, I personally struggled with depression with 4 years (Bipolar depression) It's a living hell. But the best thing YOU as YOU in person can do is trying to get help. 

Before you are going to get help, you need to talk to yourself and ask. Am I ready to get help? Do I want to get help? Do I want to get better? 

It took me some time before I decided to get help and I got help fast, I had several scars all over my body because of my depressive episodes. I went first to my doctor, he sent me to support contact, that was sort of not helping but it was a comfort for me, knowing I could talk to someone who cared and tried to help, with best of their ability. She send me further, and after many months I am feeling better. 

&amp;#x200B;

It's a long journey to get help, but soon as it starts. You will get better even if you feel like you're getting now where. For me felt like I personally got now where, just stuck but in reality I was getting progress. 

&amp;#x200B;

,depression,"I'm not going to kill myself, I'm only here to take care of 2 elderly adults and I'm too much of a coward to end it but I wish every single day I was dead I can hear my own voice screaming at myself in my head to end it everyday. It's painful being awake and shuffling through life every single day.

I've burnt large areas of skin, I've been sliced open, I've broken bones and then dropped heavy things on said broken bones, heavy dental work with no numbing, stomach pains so bad until I passed out, I've had plenty of physical pain.

It doesn't measure up to the mental pain of waking up and living.

I'm sick of shuffling through life when It never gets better.

I've tried all the therapy bullshit, 10+ years of it, 9 therapists, a shopping list of medications and dosages. 
I'm sick of therapists just saying ""I'm sorry"" when I tell them my issues, because there is no solutions to them.

Coping skills do not work. Medication is useless on me. If I hear about CBT one more time I'm gonna flip.


I just don't want to be alive.

,depression,"I think 2020 did us all dirty. Let's share the worst things that happened to us, but the best things too.

Worst : 
The beginning of the year was pretty rough for me. I lost my grandfather and my 40 year-old uncle within one week.

Today, my cat was hit by a car. He was only 10 months old.



Best :
Honestly, I don't really know. I think quarantine was necessary for me, to sort out my thoughts a little, to think about who I am and try to understand myself and my needs. I'm very lost and it's very hard to live. 

I'm trying not to fall back in the self-harm loop. I'm 534 days clean! 

I gained a little more motivation to improve my photography skills. I've been playing video games too, that's been fun. 

I've seen beautiful places I hadn't seen in ages, breathed fresh air. 



But other than that, I'm very stressed. My life doesn't look like anything. I don't do anything of my days, I stay on my phone, browse reddit, watch videos, play video games, I'm so unmotivated and empty/numb that I don't really even listen to music anymore, even though that's what is keeping me sane. 

I'm looking forward to getting a treatment. My mother is against it but I've been feeling miserable for more than two years now and a change is MANDATORY. It has to change. I can't stand being useless. If I can't please myself at least I have to please my family, you know? At least I'd stop feeling guilty and selfish? But it's just not the case yet. 

I'll fail my graduation if I keep walking down that path, and I'll never have my driver's license as well. 

But I'm not losing hope. I'm young, I might be scared but I know I'll experience brighter days. I hope my social anxiety will soothe, I hope I'll meet a good guy, whom I'll marry, have kids, tell stories. That's just what I want, deep down.

&lt;p&gt;But other than that, I&amp;#39;m very stressed. My life doesn&amp;#39;t look like anything. I don&amp;#39;t do anything of my days, I stay on my phone, browse reddit, watch videos, play video games, I&amp;#39;m so unmotivated and empty/numb that I don&amp;#39;t really even listen to music anymore, even though that&amp;#39;s what is keeping me sane. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m looking forward to getting a treatment. My mother is against it but I&amp;#39;ve been feeling miserable for more than two years now and a change is MANDATORY. It has to change. I can&amp;#39;t stand being useless. If I can&amp;#39;t please myself at least I have to please my family, you know? At least I&amp;#39;d stop feeling guilty and selfish? But it&amp;#39;s just not the case yet. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ll fail my graduation if I keep walking down that path, and I&amp;#39;ll never have my driver&amp;#39;s license as well. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But I&amp;#39;m not losing hope. I&amp;#39;m young, I might be scared but I know I&amp;#39;ll experience brighter days. I hope my social anxiety will soothe, I hope I&amp;#39;ll meet a good guy, whom I&amp;#39;ll marry, have kids, tell stories. That&amp;#39;s just what I want, deep down. But as of today, I&amp;#39;m miserable.&lt;/p&gt;

,depression,"Hey guys,

I would really like some help/advice. Apologies for the length of the post in advance. 

I am a male (32) and am going through a very tough time mentally, as I can imagine many on this forum are. I have, through the years, become very hard on myself. I rarely celebrate achievements and constantly talk negatively to myself. I was clinically depressed from about 2009 to 2013, when I was doing my BSc in physics. The last year was horrible but there was a sense of relief when it was over. I then did an MSc from 2013-2015 which I, with some problems, managed to get through and met a lot of great people. I would say my depression was not very present during these years, but I was still very critical of myself. I then rolled into a PhD without thinking about it too much. The first few years I was doing ok mentally, ups and downs but nothing serious. However, the last 6 months of the program was horrible for me. I was constantly anxious about failing, about not being good enough, about the worst outcomes which could arise. These outcomes, obviously, did not occur. I was diagnosed with GAD and tried therapy to alleviate symptoms. Meanwhile I thought I would get some experience in another position, as my goal or dream had always been to get a training position in a hospital. While working and waiting for interviews my anxiety gradually got worse and questioned if I would get a position, in an OCD manner. Everyday questioning myself and what I am doing. Eventually I got a position and I thought all my problems would go away. However, 2 months into the position I broke down. I was crying and having panic attacks daily. It all seemed too much, the new information, any task... it was all just too much. Its not even that the hours were bad, it was just that anything seemed too overwhelming. I was suicidal and then re-diagnosed with depression. I was put on SSRIs and sleeping pills. I reported in sick for 6 weeks. During the 6 weeks I did improve. When I was gardening or doing DIY tasks I felt actually quite good and kept thinking I would be happier if I could do something simple like this, that I know I can handle. I was still burdered by the worried over whether I was my ruining career or whether the job was for me. 

I began to go back to work, little by little. But am sometimes still feeling as if I am not good enough or overwhelmed by things. After a call/meeting I go outside and just sit, exhausted. I often have an urge just to try apply for something else, but that might not be the best timing. As everything seems like it is not reality right now and I need to perhaps get better before doing this? The problem is I then think I need to move now, because if I dont get better and lose this job, who will hire me?

,depression,"I wanted to thank everyone in this sub for being supportive always. Even if I didn’t directly post here often, and lurked more than anything, seeing everyone post about their thoughts and the replies made a lot of rough moments easier. 

I have gotten over my depression. It’s a thing that I haven’t seen much of and honestly never thought I would post something like this. I’ve been depressed since I was a kid and I never thought of life without depression. I didn’t know what it would be like or what to expect. However, I was told over the last weekend that I seemed so much happier and upbeat. And then I realized that I haven’t been depressed in months. I haven’t even noticed since I just assumed I was always going to be depress. 

You can stop reading here unless you want the semi-full story. I wish all of you luck in finding your happiness!

I would like to preface this by saying that depression affects everyone differently, and likewise different solutions will help different people. What worked for me, and more importantly what DIDN’T work for me, doesn’t mean it’ll affect you the same. 

Things that didn’t work for me were medications, therapy, sitting at home by myself in the dark often, eating, being financially stable. I always told myself “I need a better therapist” or “different medications”. I always told myself that “I’ll be happier when I’m more financially stable”.

What did work for me is a bit complicated. I moved. That’s the first real big thing. I moved somewhere that is aesthetically pleasing to me. I used to live in a very run-down town. I used to live in an arena with nothing to really do around it. I used to live in an area that was cramped, tons of stuff to do but having to fight through 40 minutes of traffic to do any of it, and just overall a bit claustrophobic. These were all the different areas I lived in that weren’t helpful to getting me out of the house. I now live in an area that’s spacious and still has a lot of stuff to do around within 15-30 minute drives. Anything I need is around the corner. The whole area is brighter and newer. The houses aren’t run down and businesses are thriving. It’s an odd change of pace but it’s helped substantially.

I started doing martial arts again. I loath the gym. I hate working out. It’s just not my thing. But martial arts gets me physically active without going somewhere I hate and feeling like I gained nothing from it. Moving and being active goes a long way, but for me I had to feel like it was worth it. 

I started showering daily. I know this seems like a “well of course” thing but... I feel like depression causes you to skip days of showering. Forcing myself to shower was very helpful. It was easier to do since I was sweaty from working out. I would like to mention that when someone forced me to shower (like an ex or someone close) it was not helpful. You have to do it yourself. Otherwise it turns into some sort of smoldering annoyance with the person making you do the things. 

I moved to this area for the other side of my family. Included in that is my brother and my niece. I live with them currently. My niece has been an absolutely cornerstone of my recovery. I’ve always felt like I lost that childlike wonder/spark. Holidays weren’t the same and little things didn’t matter. But I love my niece very much and watching this 8 year old child love things and get excited about things just helps me see things that way. I also get to play with her and love her and spoil her... she’ll never know how much she helped her uncle. And I hope she never has to know or understands. I want her to grow up happy and I’ll do whatever I can do help that. 


That’s it for the most part. Of course there are a lot of small things and nuances, but overall these are the things that helped me most. I hope someone else can relate and improve their own quality of life. But again, it’s different for everyone. My word is not gospel. It’s not the path to enlightenment.

And if you can’t find anything, know that I understand that too. I do not want this post to bring anyone down, although I am not blind to the possibility that it might. If nothing else, I hope it inspires hope and empathy. I am trying to show that, while maybe not often in our world, these qualities do still exist. I love you all and I hope you smile sometime soon. No matter how small.. please try to answer the prompt. How has someone appreciated you recently? (Hint you can answer with this post, if it applies!) 

I’m a slow learner. At 25, I’m finally hitting my “angry teenage years.” After college, I felt so alone. I pushed everyone away from me. I hated myself and felt like a failure. It was a deep sea of sadness, and not knowing how to swim, I resorted to wrath to try and thrash myself tot he surface. And this keeps building and building. I need to be alone, and I’ll cut any ties to get there. 

I have a lot of hatred in my heart, which is paradoxical since I still laugh like a child. One of the qualities people like about me is my laugh. I’m a man, but it’s so high pitched, child like, and genuine that it causes others to laugh. It’s so contagious that it can sometimes cause others to adapt their laugh to a similar tune. This puts a lot of pressure on me, if you can understand that. I’ve spent a lot of time hating the best parts of me to try and learn and become stronger. I’m afraid of a lot, especially people, which again is paradoxical since I’m usually well liked. 

I was typically a quiet kid, and when I did speak it was usually something humorous or kind. I’m shy. Hatred and darkness isn’t something you’d expect me to be. But it is me, at least part of me.  It’s a very important part. I sometimes explode at people, claiming that they don’t understand me, because, well, they honestly don’t. But it feels like finally my family is trying to take steps to understand me. 

The most recent development is probably also the biggest. My mother... is reading *anime*. Itachi Uchiha from Naruto is very important to me. I connect very deeply to him and the blind seer trope in general. My mother, who is close to 60, is reading anime (the two Itachi Shinden light novels) in an attempt to understand me. And I think that might be some of the deepest love I’ve ever felt. I want to cry writing this. It’s beautiful. It makes me think of all those times people wouldn’t even take interest in what I had to say or mention because it seemed weird. They didn’t even try... but she is. And that means the fucking world to me.

,depression,"This month I feel sad although I know I have so much to be grateful for. I feel pain. I feel alone. I fear never being loved unconditionally again. Part of my brain tells me this is irrational but it’s just so hard to see past it right now. I wasn’t ready but this needed to happen. Remembering the good is so much easier than remembering the bad right now. Why is everything so skewed? There was so much wrong. I complained constantly. I couldn’t see a future. It ended so long ago... before either of us realized it. But it’s still so hard to see things any other way. I feel lost. I feel ashamed. I feel embarrassed. Embarrassed that it’s been nearly a year and it just seems to be getting harder. I feel like I’m being punished. I feel embarrassed for the person I was. Hating myself made me such a cruel partner.  When did I become that way? I’m having a hard time loving myself right now even though I know I need that the most. I fight so hard to smile everyday. I really hope the “fake it till you make it works.”  Change is so hard but I keep telling myself it’s for the better. It’s hard to believe that right now. I know I’ve been through this before a few times. I know it’s not different even though my brain is making me feel like it’s the end of the world. I’m scared because I’m older. I’m scared that you regret me.. I don’t know why that even matters. This is all the past and so you’re so far gone. You’re different, I am different. I just don’t know anything else. It hurts to think of you loving someone else...and it hurts even more to think about someone else loving you the way that I should have. I need to work on re-wiring my brain and pushing this all to the past because that’s what this is. We are strangers now. I need to stop living in this memory. I need to stop feeling this way. I need to let go. I need to move forward. I need to feel better. I need to fight through this and be a better version of myself. I need to be happy again. I need to let go. It’s been so long.

I know that time heals all but why is this getting harder each and every day? Is it that I’m counting that days knowing it’s been nearly one year since I last saw you?  Five months since we spoke. Fuck this hurts. After six years I never thought I’d have to live a day without you. 

I want to be happy so bad but I’m completely destroyed knowing someone else is loving you. I know I need to be moving forward. I’m trying so hard to do everything.

I feel pain. I feel alone. I fear never being loved unconditionally again. Part of my brain tells me this is irrational but it’s just so hard to see past it right now. I wasn’t ready but this needed to happen. Remembering the good is so much easier than remembering the bad right now. Why is everything so skewed? There was so much wrong. I complained constantly. I couldn’t see a future. It ended so long ago... before either of us realized it. But it’s still so hard to see things any other way. I feel lost. I feel ashamed. I feel embarrassed. Embarrassed that it’s been nearly a year and it just seems to be getting harder. I feel like I’m being punished. I feel embarrassed for the person I was. Hating myself made me such a cruel partner.  When did I become that way? I’m having a hard time loving myself right now even though I know I need that the most. I fight so hard to smile everyday. I really hope the “fake it till you make it works.”  Change is so hard but I keep telling myself it’s for the better. It’s hard to believe that right now. I know I’ve been through this before a few times. I know it’s not different even though my brain is making me feel like it’s the end of the world. I’m scared because I’m older. I’m scared that you regret me.. I don’t know why that even matters. This is all the past and so you’re so far gone. You’re different, I am different. I just don’t know anything else. It hurts to think of you loving someone else...and it hurts even more to think about someone else loving you the way that I should have. I need to work on re-wiring my brain and pushing this all to the past because that’s what this is. We are strangers now. I need to stop living in this memory. I need to stop feeling this way. I need to let go. I need to move forward. I need to feel better. I need to fight through this and be a better version of myself. I need to be happy again. I need to let go. It’s been so long.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I know that time heals all but why is this getting harder each and every day? Is it that I’m counting that days knowing it’s been nearly one year since I last saw you?  Five months since we spoke. Fuck this hurts. After six years I never thought I’d have to live a day without you. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I want to be happy so bad but I’m completely destroyed knowing someone else is loving you. I know I need to be moving forward. I’m trying so hard to do everything. I fight myself everyday to stay social and active. I don’t want to feel this way again. This makes me want to be alone forever. What a sad life to live.&lt;/p&gt;

,depression,"Why am I not valid?

Why can't my feelings matter as much as somebody else's? 

Why is it that whenever I try to calm someone and help them, it's that ""I don't understand"". Everyone goes through pain, and some sort of depression in there life time. I have to understand to some degree. 

Why don't they help me understand and actually listen to what I'm saying instead of jumping to ""You don't understand"". They asked me for help, they opened up to me but they push me down and don't give me a chance to show I do understand. And I am there for them all the way through. I do feel pain and hurt. More than they know.

When I seek help, it's always that Im not hurting enough yet. Or other people have it worse so I do not matter as much. People say ""there are people out there who experience more than you, hurt more than you, have other problems than you"" but why is that an excuse? How am I suppose to ignore how i feel all the time? It doesn't make it easier. It doesn't make it go away. It makes me feel like I'm not supposed to feel how I do, and I shouldn't bring it up. I feel like my feelings aren't even real anymore. There made up in my head.

I just want to feel like I am cared for. People say they care but do they? Actions speak louder then words and those actions are telling me to push away how I feel even more.

,depression," 

I'm a friendless, kissless and loser virgin at 33 years old and tired of it. I never held a girl’s hand before.

I got told a hundred times that things would get better, that I've got time, that by bettering myself it would happen. I'm now nearly 3 decades and a half old and spent years trying to get dates. I wasn't attractive or desirable when I was at my physical best and at my mentally healthiest. Now I realize that if it happened when I was in my prime, it won't happen afterwards unless there's a miracle, and I don't hold hopes for that. 

The saying ""you're still young"" is worthless when you've been hearing it for more than a decade, it doesn't feel young anymore, quite the opposite. I've seen several therapists and still am in therapy and I finally decided to stop the bleeding and end this joke.

The one positive in this is that by virtue of having no friends or people that care about me alive is that they won't care either if I'm dead and gone, not much damage I can do there. I've been trying to live and find meaning while alone and with nobody caring about me, it only holds out for so long. A lonely life is only worth it if you can leave this loneliness. I can't, it isn't worth it.

And if you're going to say, 'relationships won't magically fix my life', either refrain from it or fuck off, it's not about a SO repearing me with magic, but about the fact that humans are social creatures and that I'm missing a core component.",t2_688yn3pk,False,,0,False,"I decided to off myself in two years, this life is not worth living.",[],r/depression,False,0,,0,,False,t3_h0i21z,False,dark,0.91,,public,8,0,{},,False,[],,False,False,,{},,False,8,,False,,False,,[],{},,True,,1591845792.0,text,0,,,text,self.depression,False,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m a friendless, kissless and loser virgin at 33 years old and tired of it.

,depression,"So I guess before I start I should say that to the outside world and physically I have a good live and me and my family love each other.

So a bit of backstory and general descriptions of my family. To start my mom and my dad got married had my older sister (who we will call L) then 21 months later had me, about 2 years later they got divorced because they just didn't match which doesn't affect me and I don't really remember them together. Fast forward a few years and my mom got remarried and unbeknownst to my sister and I they would fight all the time but they kept it pretty well hidden. Fast forward to August 2013 my dad remarried and about a year before that L was put into the hospital for an auto immune disease. Fast forward to 2016 my little sister was born (we will call her M) and 2017 L had her first seizure on a cruise and I was scared and didn't know what to do and the only thing I knew was that I would do more harm that good by being in the way so I moved to the back of the crowd. A year later we were coming back home from another cruise and we had to take a train to the airport and L was delusional and having hallucinations  a few hours later she had a seizure on an escalator. 2019 not much happened except another seizure and mom's and stepfather's fighting was out in the open to me and L and I took it as my job to keep L protected as much as possible from the fighting(M doesn't live with me and L all the time she is our half sister) by 2020 my stepfather and my mom ended up fighting again and he was holding up a fist in a threatening way and L and I were watching tv upstairs  and so I turned up the volume to protect L. We ended up moving out and here we are now.

So the post is titled  'what am I' and I am about to answer that but first I ask what middle child do you get with on older sister that has ADHD, epilepsy, a reading disability, is immature, and must be protected but is also annoying. A stepmother who yells at you half the time you see her, a verbally abusive stepfather, a mother who tells you to be nicer to your older sister, a four year old. And nobody understands/cares about privacy, and they praise the older sister when she gets a 70 in grades?

The answer is me. Now for what I am. I am a useless human beeing with undiagnosed depression and anxiety and possibly ptsd. I am a worrier and would give anything for my family (sisters in particular) and yet I am told to be nicer, I get no privacy and no alone time and minimal privacy in the shower. I have food restrictions and probably below average grades 80-90. I am constantly told to 'do better' or 'be more mature' and when I ask about L I get 'she has ADHD' or 'she has a reading disability' or 'she is two grades ahead of you' and I always want to respond with something similar to 'yeah well in two years I will be in her grade and you won't care because she moved up two years as well and you won't give a damn about be' I give my food to others even if I want it because I always tell myself that they need it more. I don't care about myself and would give my life to a dying person and the only reason I'm not dead yet is because I don't want my family to be like me. Im not afraid of death and sometimes I fear the light more than the dark and the solution and support and help more than the problem and the monsters in my head.

,depression," I think it should be pretty obvious from the title (but I don't know how to post trigger warnings) so I'll mention here that this post does talk about the two times I attempted suicide. Also, I don't really understand depression, so if i mischaracterize it somehow or offend somebody by posting this here, I apologize. I'm new to reddit and  just hoping to learn more from the people on may have had similar experiences if you are willing to share with me.

In the past I was really really sensitive. Like, the littlest thing would leave me feeling absolutely awful. My parents always told me I wasn't depressed, and I agreed with them. I guess I was pretty happy most of the time.  I always got perfect grades, I was the captain of the cheer-leading squad, I volunteered in my community, etc. I wasn't sad all the time, I didn't feel like i had the angsty ""depression"" I see on television or in books.

I would just have these horrible mood swings where I went from feeling fine to feeling horribly negative emotions. I would get super angry, frustrated, upset over little things, and so forth. They got really really constant for a few years. They got so bad that I attempted to take my own life twice while in one of these ""meltdowns"" as my mom called them.

During the meltdowns, the main reason I wanted to end my life was because I constantly felt like a worthless piece of trash that was taking up too much space on this planet.

,depression,"I am a 22 year old male currently battling a larger enemy than what I can take on my own. 

A little bit of back story. I grew up in a broken home. My parent divorced when I was 12 and my mother moved my sister and I a thousand miles with just what would fit in our car. My father was a drug addict and really didn't seem to care for his family or his 2 kids. I came out as gay to my family and friends when I was a senor in high-school. That all went well but now I am starting to deal with repressed memories and feelings. 

I have total mental meltdowns while at work. My mental health is started to affect my performance at work. I feel like I am just not the main character of my own life story. Like I will never have a great fairy tale love or have a purpose in life because that's only meant for the main character. 

I also told someone who I am very close with that I was starting to have feelings for them. I was able to deal with that by realizing that the feelings weren't real and it was just my depression making me feel lonely and craving the attention that he gave me. 

I have a large support system with some amazing friends in my life that I can lean on. I know that I need help in dealing with my enemy's i am just not sure how to go about finding the help.

Like I will never have a great fairy tale love or have a purpose in life because that&amp;#39;s only meant for the main character. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also told someone who I am very close with that I was starting to have feelings for them. I was able to deal with that by realizing that the feelings weren&amp;#39;t real and it was just my depression making me feel lonely and craving the attention that he gave me. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have a large support system with some amazing friends in my life that I can lean on. I know that I need help in dealing with my enemy&amp;#39;s i am just not sure how to go about finding the help. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you have any ideas please let me know because my depression is making it impossible for me to figure it out alone.&lt;/p&gt;

I really don&amp;#39;t. But i don&amp;#39;t know what I can do.&lt;/p&gt;

I fucking had it all. The knife, the pills, I even have a fucking rope literally under my bed. That's 3 good fucking methods to end it. And the door was locked too, fucking perfect timing.

I thought about overdosing, easiest way to go. Imagined it. Imagined someone breaking my door to find my cold and lifeless corpse in bed, skin pale and lips blue, eyes lifeless too.

But then I imagined him. My little brother. God, he's my sunshine. He's one of the reasons I'm even still alive, because I could never bring myself to take that final leap over the edge, all for him, because I cant fucking stand the thought of him growing up and me missing out on it.

And it was like a slap to my face last night, when he came in my daydream. I kind of had to check my heart was still beating and assure myself I was still alive. I was scared of dying.

&lt;p&gt;But then I imagined him. My little brother. God, he&amp;#39;s my sunshine. He&amp;#39;s one of the reasons I&amp;#39;m even still alive, because I could never bring myself to take that final leap over the edge, all for him, because I cant fucking stand the thought of him growing up and me missing out on it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And it was like a slap to my face last night, when he came in my daydream. I kind of had to check my heart was still beating and assure myself I was still alive. I was scared of dying.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But I sure as fuck am scared of living.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So what the fuck do I do. To get out of my misery, what the fuck do I do&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m just a fucking kid man&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I just wanna be a fuckin kid again&lt;/p&gt;

,depression,"I'm not too sure how to word this and I'm just posting to see if anyone else has awful moments similar to mine and could maybe offer some advice?

So, I'm 18 and have been suffering with severe depression, anxiety and self-harm since I was 12. I'm currently on Citalopram and spent four months in a psychiatric ward last year after I attempted suicide. I'm under Adult Mental Health Services in the community and have a CPN (recently my old one left so I've got a new one who I've not yet met/spoken to). I am nearly 7 months self-harm-free.

I find it incredibly difficult to open up to people in fear of them thinking I;m over reacting, that I'm pahetic, weak, or if I say something that concerns them enough I'd get sectioned (happened once after my sister was really concerned, took me to A&amp;E and I got sectioned). I attemped suicide again in March but my brothers found me and I spent a few days in hospital getting treatment to reverse what I did. I somehow managed to avoid another hospital admission which was honestly a wake up call that I didn;t want to keep destroying myself anymore.

Overall I'd say I've really been trying hard to combat my depression and anxiety, but I get these overwhelming moments every now and then where I feel so desperate to kill myself or slice my entire body deeply with a scalpel till I bleed out. 

I've been doing better with managing my suicidal thoughts because I've discovered what's important to me in life, like my family, friends, pets, hobbies etc, and I can see a future for myself now and have dreams and plans to go back to education this September. 

But in these moments, it all just completely hits me, usually for a few hours. It's so distressing and hard to cope when I get like that. 

Last night I got hit by one of those moments and I lay in bed crying for a while while my sister rang me, then my friend, for a few hours. A few hours later I was feeling okay and no longer had the desire to hurt/kill myself. 

I wish so much that I could stop these moments by myself and wouldn't have to rely on others to pull me through. It's so awful that one minute, nothing in the world matters to me and I feel so ready to finally kill myself, and then just a few hours later, I'm literally fine? 

I have a telephone appointment with my new CPN on Friday. I deal with awful social anxiety and get so nervous and panicky talking on the phone especially. I'm not sure how to even express my thoughts and feelings to him because I've bottled it all up for so long and hardly opened up to anyone truly. I'm terrified of being honest because I don't even understand my own thoughts anymore. Also, I'm so worried if I tell my CPN about my suicidal thoughts he'd get worried and send someone to my house to check on me, which I really wouldn't want.

,depression," 

Hi all,

I just thought I’d pass along what I’ve learned as I’ve gotten into my 30s. The short of it is: don’t be afraid to do things that make you happy; it’s not worth trying to be perfect if that means forsaking anything that might show you to be imperfect. I’m alone--and unhappy about it--at 32. A lot of the toxicity in my life that has made me unhappy, and those around me, was my focus on never thinking I was good enough and having to be perfect. 

From the outside, I think most people would consider me successful: I’m a decent looking guy, got scholarships to attend a good school, and am now in a PhD program at a top-tier research university. But I’ve been absolutely miserable for most of that time. I always, always sacrificed getting to know people or doing things that might put me at risk of looking foolish (dancing, partying, singing, whatever) and focused on my work. But in the end, I ended up not enjoying any of that work--I chose a project I thought other people wanted me to pick, I isolated myself thinking I had to work harder than everyone else, and now the whole process is so joyless and solitary that I dread working on my research. 

In the end, I don’t even want to take a job with the degree I earned. 

I was also extremely fortunate to be in a six-year long relationship with a beautiful and creative woman. But I hung a lot of my happiness on her. I was miserable in my work, anxious and stressed all the time about small things, and generally unwilling to be vulnerable with her. I think I imagined I had the weight of the world on my shoulders and couldn’t ever risk looking like I couldn’t carry that weight--which, ironically,  would mean that I would frequently reveal how imperfect I was by being irritable, frustrated, and isolated. 

My girlfriend--who I’ve been in a long distance relationship with--has now pulled far away from me and has said she’s no longer romantically interested in me. Let me tell you, it is very hard watching your best friend and lover become a stranger to you--especially when that person is almost all of your social world. Another guy has also entered the picture who’s confident and has his life together--they spend a lot of time together while I'm stuck far away in lockdown. I’ve not heard much from her, though I’ve reiterated my commitment to trying to repair our relationship. I expect that sometime this week we’ll end our relationship, but she cares too much about me to make a clean break right now.

I think I could weather all these things more easily if I’d filled my life with friends, hobbies, and other things that might have built me up as a person. And if I’d done that earlier, I might not also be facing the end of a relationship in which I derived so much of my happiness. I've been absolutely miserable now--just spending my days wandering around the city, going back to an empty apartment, and crying to myself. But ultimately I know what I have to do--and this goes for people who might be able to relate to this story--I've got to open up to people and experiences, knowing that it doesn't matter whether I'm good enough or not. 

The old saying is definitely true: if you don’t love yourself, you won’t be able to love others. Go out there and take the risks to be happy, don’t hate yourself because you’re not perfect. 

I hope everyone else that is struggling knows that there's other people out there also going through pain and loss.

I have a freaking amazing personality, talkative, very understanding, and most importantly I treat everyone I meet with the utmost respect.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I know for a fact that I can make someone else happy and in turn would make me happy again. But at this stage of life, I think I&amp;#39;m going to be in it for the long run, by myself. And it scares the shit out of me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#39;t get matches on dating apps, I can&amp;#39;t go out to bars and meet people because of the pandemic, I&amp;#39;m not very attractive.&lt;/p&gt;

I want to be able to let out what’s bothering me with a friend or even a counsellor. But it’s all come down to me feeling like a burden to everything. I’m a burden and that’s what I am. &lt;/p&gt;

,depression,"I had depression since I was 14, when my dad died. I mean, the person who I considered my dad since I was 6 - my real father was violent towards my mother and me.
 It had phases were things were calmer and I could deal with it. 13 years later, things are not better.
Since months ago got out of a toxic relationship. I loved him deeply, and would do anything for him. He was violent. Funny how things are. I guess that's what I thought love was. Started out light I guess, my through the years it escalated. I don't even know what to say or feel about it all honestly. He gastlighted me a lot. Made me feel like I was exaggerating. That it was my fault. I tripped. I made him mad. And then would come the honey moon phase. The person who made me feel like shit was my savior. My brain, trying to get away from the situation, started to depersonalize. This started happening 3 years ago. There is a lot I don't remember. Most of the violent episodes per say, I don't remember. I remember seeing the angry look in his eyes and then feeling the pain.
I wasn't always violent. We had good moments, has probably everyone does. We lived together 4 years. No one knew the entire time. I tried to kill myself and thought of killing myself during that time. And after. Kinda wondering how would it be now.
Since I broke up, the depersonalization stayed. Acompanyed by PTSD, and anxiety attacks and ofc, the depression (this was diagnosed by my therapist).
There are days were I still can't leave the house. Spend my days crying, not understanding if I have any worth or not.
Thought that finishing my college degree would help and make me feel better. Worked for that. The day I knew I had graduated, feel genuine happiness for about an hour. Then, the same emptiness.
What is the point? What am I fighting for, if I end up feeling the same? I just wanna quit. 
Tired of not being able to breathe, this constant weight on my chest. Depersonalization in and out, and not being able to control it.
Being with someone, on a physical level, and needing their approval. Feeling unworthy. Ugly. Ridiculous. Hearing my ex's voice in my head saying ""you are a piece of shit. You disgust me"".

,depression,"My mom is in her 50s and no matter what I tell her, doesn’t understand mental illness. She tells me my medication isn’t working and that I need to talk to my psychiatrist when I have an off day. Many friends of mine say they experience the same. I believe back then mental health wasn’t recognized in the same way as physical health- only if you had serious problems, you were sent to a psych ward. This is at least what I understand from my mother. 

I’ve also had many people of older generations acknowledge how much harder we have it, particularly students in college currently, or even in high school. I’ve heard them acknowledge they didn’t have the same pressure we have to do well and to figure out what we want to do with our lives. They’ve just told me the world has changed and we have it much harder than they had it. 

It seems like mental health these days is also being glorified to some degree, so a lot of people try to identify with it. I’ve heard people say they’ve been depressed when really they’ve just been sad. Memes almost entirely are self deprecatory and even worse, joking about depression “I wanna die.” I think they’re really funny but it’s not really great that this has become the humor of our generation.
