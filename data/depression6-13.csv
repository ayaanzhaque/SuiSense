###Summary###

**Anyone who, while acting as a helper, invites or accepts private contact (I.e. PMs, chat, or any kind of offsite communication) early in the conversion is showing either bad intentions or bad judgement.  Either way, it's unwise to trust them.** 


""PM me anytime"" seems like a kind and generous offer. And it might be perfectly well-meaning, but, unless and until a solid rapport has been established, it's just not a wise idea.  Here are some points to consider before you offer or accept an invitation to communicate privately.

* **By posting supportive replies publicly, you'll help more people than just the OP. If your responses are of good quality, you'll educate and inspire other helpers.** [The 1-9-90 rule](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1%25_rule_(Internet_culture\)) applies here as much as it does anywhere else on the internet.  

* People who are struggling with serious mental-health issues often (justifiably) have a low tolerance for disappointment and a high-level of ever-changing emotional need. **Unless the helper is able to make a 100% commitment to be there for them in every way, for as long as necessary, offering a personal inbox as a resource is likely to do more harm than good.** This is why mental-health crisis-line responders usually don't give their names and callers aren't allowed to request specific responders.  It's much healthier and safer for the callers to develop a relationship with the agency as a whole.  Analogously, it's much safer and healthier for our OPs to develop a relationship with the community as a whole.  Even trained responders are generally not allowed to work high-intensity situations alone.  It's partly about availability, but it's mostly about wider perspective and preventing compassion fatigue. 

* **If a helper gets in over their head with someone whose mental-health issues (including suicidality, which is often comorbid with depression) escalate, in a PM conversation it's much harder for others, including the /r/depression and /r/SuicideWatch moderators to help**.  (Contrary to common assumptions, moderators can't see or police PMs.)  

* In our observation over many years, the people who say ""PM me"" the most are consistently the ones with the least understanding of mental-health issues and mental-health support. We all have gaps in our knowledge and in our ability to communicate effectively.  Community input mitigates these limitations. **There's no reason why someone who's truly here to help would want to hide their responses from community scrutiny**.  If helpers are concerned about their own privacy, keep in mind that self-disclosure, when used supportively, is more about the feelings than the details, and that we have no problem here with the use of alt/throwaway accounts, and have no restrictions on account age or karma.  

*  We all know the internet is used by some people to exploit or abuse others.  These people *do* want to hide their deceptive and manipulative responses from everyone except their victims. There are many of them who specifically target those who are vulnerable because of mental-health issues. **If a helper invites an OP to talk privately and gives them a good, supportive experience, they've primed that person to be more vulnerable to abusers.** This sort of cognitive priming tends to be particularly effective when someone's in a state of mental-health crisis, when people rely more on heuristics than critical reasoning.

* If OPs want to talk privately, posting on a wide-open anonymous forum like reddit might not be the best option. Although we don't recommend it, we do allow OPs to request private contact when asking for support. If you want to do this, please keep your expectations realistic, and to have a careful look at the history of anyone who offers to PM before opening up to them.",t2_1t70,False,,0,False,"Our most-broken and least-understood rules is ""helpers may not invite private contact as a first resort"", so we've made a new wiki to explain it",[],r/depression,False,0,,0,,False,t3_doqwow,False,dark,1.0,,public,2326,1,{},,False,[],,False,False,,{},,False,2326,,True,,False,,[],{},,True,,1572389522.0,text,0,,,text,self.depression,True,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;We understand that most people who reply immediately to an OP with an invitation to talk privately  mean only to help, but this type of response usually leads to either disappointment or disaster.  it usually works out quite differently here than when you say &amp;quot;PM me anytime&amp;quot; in a casual social context.  &lt;/p&gt;

,depression,"So, recently our unit lost a soldier to suicide. He was a friend, not a close friend, but still someone I always stopped to talk to in the hallway at work when he came in to fly.  The details are particularly gruesome and sad, so I won’t recount them, but our unit was part of the search party that went looking for him, and found him. 

We are so busy at work gearing up for a deployment that it seemed kinda easy to compartmentalize things. Also, with the Covid restrictions there were no memorials or service for anyone to attend. 

It was really getting to me though, so I created a fundraiser for Mission 22, an organization that helps veterans with PTSD, and TBI. I raised over $1000 in less than a week and things were going pretty well. However, after about 8 days into the fundraiser I was getting pretty discouraged by the lack of interest from my fellow service members. I would tag them in things and try to get them to share the fundraiser and keep it going, but got crickets.  They could post all day about “dumbocrats” , George Floyd’s criminal record, and how police brutality isn’t a problem, etc etc.  But couldn’t be bothered to share a fundraiser for Veterans mental health.  (I’m not trying to be political, a lot of things I’ve seen on social media lately are overtly racist)

,depression,"Hi everyone,

I'm 24 y/o female, my brother is a 19 y/o. Mid May, my brother was taken to the hospital for attempting suicide. His online friends called his college to request a wellness check and got the cops involved. They found him unconscious in his dorm room. 

We have a very toxic mom. To give you some context, my mom told him ""Do it right the next time so we don't have to drive 8 hours to pick you up."" She loves us but she's very immature, toxic, physically abusive, mentally abusive, etc. She's sort of a horrible human being but in her mind, she has done all she can for us. She had me when she was 19, single mom, we don't talk to our dad. 

He's set on doing it again because my brother and I have an extremely close relationship and he doesn't want to be a burden on me. He has been failing school, hates my mom, and feels like if he kills himself, my life will become better because my mom will realize she is the problem. But my mom will never know that. He thinks I'll be sad for a couple of years but I'll get through it because I'm a strong person. He has told my boyfriend that he has bought 100 pills this time for his second attempt. 

My brother is the best. But my mom has fucked him up so much. He feels like he doesn't deserve my love and feels extremely guilty that I'll have to take care of him when I went through so much to get where I am. I just graduated with a masters degree and looking for a job on the west coast.

I also want to note there is a genetic component. On my mom's side, my grandpa, my uncle have killed themselves. My mom has attempted suicide when I was in high school by jumping off our apartment but survived. I have been depressed since age 7 but became healthy two years ago. My brother has felt this way since he was 10. I told him once I get a job I can take him away forever and help him get his life back on track but he doesn't want to burden me.

,depression,"Hi,

just right now I had an experience that is so typical for me (don't know whether it is a symptom of depression. I think I have it my whole life. Only during depressed phases it gets worse).

I phoned my sister because I wanted to clarify which controller my niece (6) wanted to have for her nintendo  for her birthday. In addition, I also have a nephew (9) and I made it a tradition on birthdays to give the other one a small present, as well.

Now when we were talking, I heard my nephew saying: ""I also wished for a controller"". Now, he did not say it demanding (he is not that kind of child. he is very sensitive and always caring about others) but rather a little bit disappointed that I did not think of him and that he won't get one.

Now I get soooo sad because of this incident. I don't know whether my sister will approve of me buying him a controller, too (she has the last wors on these things). In that case my niece will get something else so she has more on her birthday. But I already fear him being disappointed and sad and not expressing his feeling because he keeps it for himself.

I get this sad feelings so often even for ""minor"" incidents where other people would say: ""That is no reason to be sad"". I, hower, tend to feel soooo sad when people I love get even slightly disappointed.

Maybe I should work on my thought processes with things like CBT. However, I feel if I trick myself from seeing the real sadness and talking myself into thinking things were better than they are.

I hope I have described my feelings reasonably well so you understand what I mean.

,depression,"For a while now, I’ve been trying to develop a comparative analogy of a normal person and someone who has depression (to some degree). But I’m not absolutely sure I’d hit the mark. I’m not officially diagnosed, but I feel like I might be dysthymic. I think I started feeling it 10 years ago, when I was about 18 years old. I didn’t know what it was until I searched for it. I’ve been wanting to get tested for it for years now, but as I’ve seen from another redditor’s post, people with dysthymia tend to avoid, or at least delay, getting diagnosed or treated. Also I’m in a country where mental health policies are still just being developed, so there isn’t much I can do without a budget. But I'll try my best to save up for whatever I might need for my mental health soon. 

Anyway, for the analogy:

Imagine two people. For this instance, set them to be in an average to comfortable socio-economic status.

One person goes through life as “walking along a path.” Challenges and problems are “obstacles” along the path. Usually it would slow a person in their progress; sometimes it may also lead them to go to other directions. When they get tired, they could rest by taking a break from walking, by sitting, by sleeping, or any other way they could rest. And when they are ready, they could just walk again, go through obstacles, rinse and repeat.

The other person goes through life as “swimming in dark, cold waters.” There’s constant discomfort/pain/struggle/fear. Just progressing from point A to point B takes so much effort already, while going through the same “obstacles” will be way more difficult. When they get tired, they’d still have to exert effort just to stay afloat. Sometimes when it all gets tiring, they sink and start to drown. Some may get a shot of adrenaline and swim back up to the surface again, take a breath, and be able to keep swimming for a while more. Rinse and repeat. Some may continue to sink to the bottom until something happens.

Now, these are just people in average to comfortable socio-economic status. Imagine being less fortunate or less privileged (poverty/bad environment/etc) as having to carry baggage. The same weight has different effects for someone walking and someone swimming. Going through obstacles while carrying baggage could break one person more easily over the other.

I have a few more analogy per aspect but I feel like this is long enough already. 

I’d like to hear some opinions as well on how to improve this. Maybe it’s too simplified or doesn’t give off as much weight as how it actually feels.

Life will go on as it went on before. And what life I have left to live, the chances of me ever affecting any meaningful change beyond my own pixel of the universe is so infetismally small that I might as well resign myself to the reality of an insignificant life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Does anyone else feel like this? How do you get beyond these soul-crushing thoughts? Please don’t say “create your own purpose” or something.&lt;/p&gt;

,depression,"Uh, this sub reddit was recommended to me by my boyfriend while I was having a mental breakdown. He said everyone here is really nice and thought maybe i could get some support or something. Sooo... Here goes nothing...


Ever since I can remember, (so up to when I was about 5) my father physically and verbally abused me and my mother. I also lived with my younger sister and brother but he liked them so he only ever 'disciplined' them. He is a drug addict and alcoholic so he was always off his head when he came home from work.

 As a child, I looked up to him. He was my favorite person in the entire world because he was so strong and brave and tall and I always wanted to be like him. Untill the day he had my mother by the throat on the bathroom floor while she was begging him to let go because she couldn't breathe. I was 6. I had to call the police because I couldn't get him to let go... I think that's when I began feeling sad... Really sad...

From grade 3 (8 yrs old) to now, year 9 (15 yrs old) I've been bullied severely and told to kill myself multiple times. In grade 5, I had a 'boyfriend' and when I ended the so-called relationship, him and his friends started calling me names like 'junkie Joyce' (as Joyce is my last name) and I ended up having a breakdown and admitting that my dad was a drug addict in front of my entire class. This really hurt alot since I didn't want people to know my dad was a bad person. Even though he had hurt me and my family.

After that I began feeling really down and I didn't have the motivation to even get out of bed. I tried talking to my mother about it and she got me to see a child psychologist. I went to two sessions and then the psychologist told my mum not to waste anymore money on sessions because I 'wasn't opening up'. I just didn't know how to explain how I was feeling. And since I was only 12, I really didn't feel comfortable talking to a stranger about the things I was thinking. 

For a few years, I was friends with this girl who was a very bad influence. She constantly encouraged and essentially forced me to smoke cigarettes and Marijuana. Now, I was always a pretty good child, so obviously I didn't want to because I knew I'd get in massive trouble if my mother found out. I mostly refused her offers, but I eventually caved and started smoking with her. When I told her I wasn't going to do anything with her anymore she attacked me (cuz she was high on ice) and then spread romours about me saying I was a druggie and a whore and just crude lies. Obviously it shouldn't have hurt me that much because I saw it coming, but it still hit hard to know that so many people believed her.

I eventually found some new friends who really cared about me and made me feel happy. I even started dating this really nice guy and I'm still with him after more than 19 months. But I eventually started feeling really down again and didn't want to go to school or even wake up in the morning. I started questioning my existence and began thinking that everyone would be better off without me. It got so bad that I attempted scuicide by cutting my wrists. Recently, I tried to tell my mum how I was feeling, but I didn't have the confidence to talk to her face to face, so I wrote her a letter and slipped it under her door. About half an hour after, she burst into my room and started yelling at me saying that I had no right to write such bullshit. That was only two months ago. Ever since then, I've been really really down and sad and I've been having mental breakdowns and anxiety attacks almost every day. I tried to talk to a professional, but I ended up getting yelled at by my mother because I 'didn't talk to her first'.

,depression,"I left my wife a couple months ago because I couldn't bare it anymore. We were constantly fighting and eventually started living like roommates. There was no more love (from me anyways) only resentment.

I just realized I wasn't depressed as much because of what she was doing (the constant fights, throwing things, hitting, the blame and criticism) but rather because of what she was: her confidence, ease to connect with people, the fact that everybody liked her instantly (me included), perseverance, hard working personality, ability to stay happy and positive. In reality, seeing all these things in her that I felt I was lacking killed me depressed. My envy slowly killed me from the inside, making me resent her, because she had it all, and kept putting me down for not doing/being.

,depression,"So, about 2 - 3 days ago, me and my mum weren’t on the best of terms. I don’t know if I can say anything different about now, though.

My mum found blunt scissors in the bathroom, and she, and my therapist, already knew about my previous issues with self harm, so, reasonably, she thought I had used them to cut myself in the bathroom, and left them there, (which I still don’t get because they were so blunt), so she asked to see my arm, before grabbing them, and rolling my sleeves up.

I started to get really shaky and anxious, and tried to tell her that I didn’t leave them there or use them, but could only stutter, and even started to smirk a little at how ridiculous this was. She stared at all these fresh, new cuts, and older ones she hadn’t seen before, and ran her hand up them, after she had been advised to get rid of sharp objects, and then medications, in case I took another overdose / suicide attempt. She was furious, and I mean furious. I quickly retracted my arms back.

She immediately made me switch off my phone, and hand it in, before screaming at the top of her lungs, rhetorically asking me why I even ever cut myself, and if I want to ruin both her, and my life. Next day, I was supposed to be on the phone with my therapist, but it turned out that my mum had already rang her to explain what happened. My therapist, lets call her Karen, was also kind of shocked that I hadn’t told her either, and she still wanted to talk on the phone as usual, using my mum’s phone, alone, so we did. she asked me why I did it, after refraining for so long, and I said the usual shit like: “I was sad, I have no motivation, I’m having bad days”, but I honestly still can’t wait to tell the truth, or not, on Monday, (when I next get to talk). I could literally hear my mum walking around, outside the door, so I made sure to keep the conversation discreet, and vague.

I guess my mum must’ve told her that she took my phone away, because she asked me why I think she took it away from me, (i’ve clearly got it back now), and I just said: “because she doesn’t want me to do it again, and knows what to do when I do”. She asked what I would like, [Mum], to understand, and I said to react better and make it less awkward for the both of us. She then said she was sorry that I felt this way, but honestly I was so mad at both my mum, and her, but more at myself. I felt like they were reacting as if I was a bad kid, although Karen probably wasn’t. These past few days, I’ve literally been like a walking zombie, just waiting for the next time I can finally end it all.

my mum gave me my phone back today, but made me both apologise, and thank her. I got so annoyed at that point, and still am, because she just treats my self - harm as a bad habit, although it probably is, and something that i’m doing to misbehave, or be naughty about, when really it’s a really maladaptive coping mechanism, that I still haven’t grown out of yet. Every time I get that chance to meet my therapist in person, and we talk about my mood, my mum always springs up about how she’s felt the same, (fucking postnatal depression), and that she just talked to someone, most preferably her older sister, and that helped. It pissed me to the actual core when she says this, she thinks that it something that can be “cured” by just talking to someone, and that it’ll pass, and is still waiting, (I think), for me to talk to her, but no way on earth is that happening. She also thinks that she can stop me from self - harming by telling me to stop, and that i’ll stop immediately. god do i hate family therapy.

I just wish that I could die. I’ve been so suicidal for most of my life, but I’m not going to tell my therapist that, although I probably should at this point, because, i remember when I told my school nurse, who is probably a better person to talk to, but that’s probably just because i’m more used to her than Karen, and have spoken to her for much longer, that I was suicidal, and about to commit suicide any chance I got, at school, and she told my head of year to call my dad to pick me up, after [my head of year], came up, and tried to calm me down, and take me straight to Karen’s office, whilst giving me the usual thoughtful “talk”. He called my mum, who was already informed, who asked to “speak” to me. I was absolutely petrified. She started screaming at the top of her lungs, saying that I didn’t know what I was doing, and how serious that was. Tried to explain, wouldn’t let me speak.

So yeah. I’m not doing that again, especially being stuck with mum at home. I really wish I could hate her for her really shitty reactions, but, according to Karen, she comes from a place of shock, and “understanding”, and I can only hate myself for everything that’s happening. I feel like no one takes me seriously, and even if they do, it’s the “wrong” kind of serious.

I just want to curl up in a ball and die, but it’s not like anyone fucking cares about my feelings, and takes them the right way, anyway.

,depression,"TW: I talk about self harm in this post.

Throwaway account to respect my friend’s privacy.

I (19M) have known my best friend (19F), Sally, for over 6 years and over the course of that we have become very close. We know everything about one another and I know that she struggles with at times crippling depression and anxiety, and has a history of eating disorders. These also run in her family.

I have always been as supportive as I can and am always there for her as much as I can be. Although I suffer from mild social anxiety and ocd (although not medically diagnosed) I have to admit I have no idea what it’s like to experience depression or crippling mental illness, as I have never suffered first hand.

Sally told me that her mental health is the worst that it has ever been, but there is nothing specific that has caused this. She goes to therapy, takes antidepressants, is close with her family and friends, but feels numb to her emotions. She feels guilty and like she’s a bad person for being detached form her feelings and her love for her family and friends.

I told her that she is not a bad person, and shouldn’t feel guilty because she has no control over these things. That she is doing everything that she can and that’s what matters. That I’m proud of her for making efforts to get better and that she’s a good person.

She also told me that she cut herself for the first time in her life. That she feels guilty and pathetic and attention seeking. I told her to please talk to me or a family if she ever feels the urge to do that again. And she promised that she was never going to do it again.

I do everything I can to support her but I feel like I’m not doing enough. I came here for advice on how to help Sally and ask if there’s anything else I can do to make her feel better, or at least prevent her from hurting herself again. She is one of the people I love most in the world and I want to be there for her as much as I can. So any advice is greatly appreciated.

I'm writing this because I want help, please. I seriously think something is wrong with my mental health but I just don't know what.

I know you're thinking I should see a psychologist, but I feel it would be pointless. I'm 17 living with my mom and I really don't want to burden her any more over something like this. I just want guidance on what I should do, and what my issue is. I know that whatever is said is not a diagnosis, but I just want to be pointed in the right direction.

A lot of the time, I feel listless. I lack energy or motivation. I feel like crying but nothing comes out. I don't think I'm happy, and I don't think I have been in a long time. I feel hopeless, and that I'm forcing myself to go on. As i'm writing this, I feel like i could cry but i fucking cant. i really just dont care about a lot of things like i used to.

the problem is that these feelings aren't constant. they really only ever come when im alone, and sometimes when im alone i feel normal. when im out at school or with friends i dont notice these feelings, which is what makes me think im not actually depressed. but if im not depressed, then what's wrong with me?

,depression,"Please help my fiancé.

I’m not even sure where to start with this really, all I know is that it will be a long post but I’ll try and keep it short, please help me. 

I won’t talk about my own life but I also suffer with mental health issues (recently been diagnosed with cptsd and ocd) including depression and anxiety myself. We have a 2 year old son together (or he will be in 3 days!) and live together in a flat. I’m 21 and he is 22. 
He suffers depression (diagnosed) and (undiagnosed) anxiety. His dad is out of the picture and has been since he was young - he beat and raped my MIL, my partner was only little at the time so doesn’t remember any of it. However, he has been having nightmares and panic attacks (especially recently) about seeing his dad beating his mum and last night especially, raping his mum. He says it happens at her house and at our home also, he is there but physically can’t touch them to stop him or get away he’s just stuck watching. 
Anyway, he has also struggled with our son and being a father (although he is a great dad) but some days he can be quite horrible to the point I’m trying to keep our son away from him. He will stay in the bedroom playing his PC or PS4 till god knows what time and will moan or get pissed off if our son goes in to see him or see what he’s doing (as intrigued toddlers do) and start shouting at him for even playing or little things and it’s like WOAH calm down, you know? I’m no where near a perfect parent, I get irritated with our son too but when he’s doing nothing wrong or even playing he’s being told off and it just breaks my heart. He doesn’t really play with our son or interact with him often unless it’s on the odd occasion and it’s just heartbreaking and I just feel like a single mum most days. I have my own struggles too, I bathe with our son because otherwise I don’t have time to bath on my own. I do all of the housework and cook 99% of the meals. I have NO alone or breathing time/space. I get our son to sleep, I get up with him during the night and I get up with him in the mornings so I’m also extremely tired and tbh just drained. He will stay in bed till 12-2pm and I’m actually going to stay with my parents tomorrow for two nights because “he needs some alone time” but doesn’t understand that I need some alone time too? Or when I ask them to leave me alone for a while he gets all pissy.. which annoys me even more until I just breakdown. I’m struggling and I don’t know what to do.  He doesn’t talk to me at all. I’ve seen him cry (or show any sort of emotion) once which was when our son was born. He never tells me anything because “it makes him feel worse” or when he does he says “at least you feel better. One of us has too” or something like that. There’s no communication there at all, for instance I tried to give him a kiss earlier whilst he was playing PC before I left the room and he just swerved and tutted at me so o said okay sorry I only wanted a kiss and then he had a go at me for being moody all the time...? 

Half of me is saying just be patient he’ll get better soon and get back to his normal self (whatever that may be now) and the other half of me is saying to just call it a day because I’m slowly starting to give up I really don’t know how much more I can take. I love him I really do but he’s not helping himself at all.

,depression,"Life sucks isn't?

I'm lonely inside my mind.. 

A broken piece.. I wouldn't call myself a piece of shit, because I worth something maybe.. 

A Tired young heart

Stupid enough to fall for those charming kind of guys 

Yes, I cry over boys because I want to feel something, other than this lonliness I thought he would be mine someday, but he dont feel the same way about me..

I wish I could escape from here and this pain.. 

U know I love my parents. I'm thankful to them for everything.. 

They sacrificed a lot to grow me and my brother..

but they failed to grew us, emotionally. Their tainted marriage and frequent quarrel was a bad example for me. 

Bad childhood traumas corrupted my personality and my thinking, I feel like everything is my fault, and I dont feel good about me at all. 

People used say I was ugly, it affected my whole personality and the perspective towards the world, I felt, if I was not pretty, I'm good for nothing, that was deep rotted in my mind and being not good looking, I stayed behind everything my whole life, because they made me feel so. 

Also I can't make friends or talk in public because I feel so bad about myself I feel that I'm ugly so nobody would like me to be their friend.. 

So I never had good friends..

School friends were trash, though had some good time but there was lot of negativity behind. 

Like them telling me indirectly I'm ugly, they looked down on me.. 

My parents failed me to grow into a strong girl.

I appreciate all they did for me.. many things.. I would never reach this far in life, if it was without them..

BUT 

They failed to teach us what love is.  

What real affection is.. 

I don't even remember if they ever kissed or hugged me.. 

Never had time to listen to my problems. 

I grew up as a secret person with all my feelings just inside me . 

Nobody really know who I'm or what I feel inside.. 

I'm not as cold hearted as it seems to me.. I'm so fragile and weak.. I can't stand pain.. I cant stand little things. I break down easily, I want soemone to hold me and tell me it's okay, but there's no one I could relay on.. 

I'm just lonely..


Lacked that real love and affection in real life so I started to search it online.. I mean like tried to make decent friends online. But it doesn't work that way, never met anyone who worth it. 

But found few guys, with whom I liked a future with and romantically interested but my bad, they dont like me that way, and I havent told them though.. 

Rest guys I met were boring hypocrites and perverts.. u know right, what they expect from a 20yr girl.. few times I felt into trap, but I hope not anymore I will not become a victim to their dirty play anymore, I dont want to be a using material for those perverts.  I'm a girl of worth and decency. 

I want real love from one and only person..   

I just wish I was special. I just what is it like to be extremely beautiful and get boys attention and feel good about myself:(

,depression,"Just wanted to preface this by saying I am NOT currently suicidal, even though I mention suicidal thoughts in this post. My life is about to change, and I don't know how yet, so I've just been doing a lot of self thinking. I ended up writing some thoughts down, and I felt a need to post it, but not to anyone I know personally, so on a throwaway.

I don’t know why, but growing up I always felt special. I felt like a child waiting for the letter from Hogwarts. I didn’t know how, but I was going to do something great, BE something great. There would be stories written about what I had done. I would have a Wikipedia article written about all the great achievements of my life.

Growing up I spent so much time in church where it’s hammered into your head that God has a plan for you, and also that God is good. I think I smashed these two concepts together one day and naturally assumed that God has a really good plan made out especially for me.

I’ve been a goody two shoes since before I could remember. One of my only specific memories from kindergarten is the only time I ever got a time out. We had various tables and work surfaces around the classroom, and for lunch, we would pull up our tiny chairs to one of them and dig in. One of the tables had a large flat piece of Lego attached to it, so one could build figures and then attach them to the table. Obviously this was the cool table. Only 4 kids were allowed at the table for lunch, otherwise we would all squish in there and make a mess. One day I was lucky enough to get there first, and the table filled out in seconds. After we had gotten settled into our Dunkaroos and Lunchables, another kid waddled over to the table and sat down. I politely (read uppity know it all) told him that the table was full, and he would have to sit elsewhere. He said no. I repeated that it was a rule. You can’t break the *rules*. He still said no. He wanted to eat lunch there. I don’t know what came over me, but I pushed him. Our teacher scrambled over after seeing this and asked what had happened. We both said our sides of the story. She said what the other kid did was breaking the rules, but what I did was more wrong. I was put on time out and not allowed to sit at the Lego table for the rest of the month. This was so confusing to me. The other kid had broken the rules! I even made sure that he knew he was doing wrong, it wasn’t a mistake or ignorance. I was just enforcing the law. I was like Batman. Batman doesn’t get put on time out, so why should I get all the punishment?

In fifth grade we had these booklets our teacher had made at the beginning of the year, with five random trivia or school topic questions for each day. First thing every morning we would come into the classroom and answer the questions as best we could, we all had the same questions. I was a bit ahead of my grade level at this time, so I did fairly well with the questions, and would frequently get all of them right. When we answered them, our teacher would go through the pile until he got to a book with all the answers right, and that kid would get to come to the front of the class and get to pick out a small prize. Now we’re talking penny candies, fancy pencils, or a sheet of stickers. Not riveting award material. At one point during the year I had a streak going. Somewhere around a week of me winning every day. One morning, our teacher was going through the pile and made a noise “Oh, got to Rachel’s!” he said. Teasing the class that it was all over for the day. There was an audible groan from somewhere in the room. He flipped to that days page and a twinge of shock suddenly shot up to his face “Wait, Rachel got one wrong, someone else had a chance for today.”. There was a gasp. Someone started clapping. Someone else joined in. The whole class started clapping and hooting at me. My best friend was clapping too.

It’s now more than 15 years later and I can’t think about that day without feeling as small and helpless as I did that day. Every peer I knew in my small fifth grade world was happy that I had failed. It took about 5 seconds to completely smash my self esteem to a pulp. Even now, I have huge issues with failure. I’m so defensive about being the slightest bit wrong on any topic, no matter how small. If I watch a movie with friends and say the wrong name for a character, and someone points it out, I will beat myself up about it for hours.

I think growing up, I assumed my path would become apparent. My high school had special “enriched” classes, that were designed to challenge gifted students. I’m not dumb, but I’m also definitely not the next Einstein. I think this was the first big crack in the window of my ideal future. I had gone from a regular grade school where I was top of the class, and the teachers would come to me to help tutor other students, to one of the lower ranking kids in this gifted school.  

Senior year was a very serious time at this school. I’m sure it is in all High Schools, but here there were kids applying to Ivy League school scholarships. These other kids all seemed to have their lives planed out for the next 10 years. After all the acceptance letters had come raining in, I remember one day in biology class our teacher thought it would be fun to go around the room and have everyone say which University they’re going to and for what program. There was lots of pre-med, bio-chem, law, the works. Everyone seemed so sure of their plans. I was the only person in the class not going onto university the following year. Recently the movie Ratatouille had come out, and I thought the way it depicted kitchens was so amazing. It was clearly hard work, but it seemed rewarding. Making edible art every day. So I had decided to go to culinary school. I was passionate about food, but admittedly one of the main reasons looking back was the program was a 2 year degree fast tracked with longer school hours into 12 months. It wasn’t a huge time commitment, and even if I didn’t end up pursuing cooking at the end of it, I still had a life skill of being able to cook well by the end of it. I was so scared of choosing the wrong path for my life. I had no idea what I wanted from life at that time, no idea of what career I wanted, where I wanted to settle down. It’s now 8 years later and I still have no idea.

I’m the kind of person who can pick a new passion project and convince myself in my head that this is it. This is the thing. Then a few weeks or months later I’ve dropped that and hopped on to the next train. Have I just not found it yet? Will it be the next one? Am I wired in a way where I just can’t commit to something? I dream of me becoming the master of something, being well known for it, but I can never just hunker down and put in the effort to actually make it a reality. I just assume that some wealthy business owner will come out of no-where, recognize my non-talent, and then insist that I take their money to start up a business.  

I know it’s a tired question, but what’s the point? Is there a point? If I lay in bed all day and eat Cheetos for all 3 meals I’ll still have the same final outcome than if I was to become a famous movie star, cure cancer, or be the first person on Mars. Some people always speak about legacy, that’s why they do things. To leave their mark. But should we care? After I’m dead I won’t care about what people say or think about me. I wont have the capacity to.

I know I must care though. The strongest thought that makes me know I wouldn’t be able to take my life is all the people I would leave behind. I know there’s people out there rooting for me to succeed, who love me fully and unconditionally. So I couldn’t do that to them. Make them feel like they’ve failed. That they could’ve done something more, read the signs better, checked in more frequently. I’m supposed to be living my life for me, and yet sometimes I feel like I’m only living my life for the sake of other people. It’s kind of ironic that living for other people may be the reason I’m still here.

Sometimes I think I’m broken. Not really in a mental health way (which I definitely feel too), but in a way where I’m missing something fundamental. I don’t know what it is though. It’s like, I’m a car without a steering wheel. I look the same to all the other cars on the outside, but there’s something fundamentally wrong. I feel emotions (sometimes way too many), I don’t feel empty, but I feel incomplete. I think it might be happiness that I’m missing.

I know I need something but I don’t know what.

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don’t know why, but growing up I always felt special. I felt like a child waiting for the letter from Hogwarts. I didn’t know how, but I was going to do something great, BE something great. There would be stories written about what I had done. I would have a Wikipedia article written about all the great achievements of my life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Growing up I spent so much time in church where it’s hammered into your head that God has a plan for you, and also that God is good. I think I smashed these two concepts together one day and naturally assumed that God has a really good plan made out especially for me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve been a goody two shoes since before I could remember. One of my only specific memories from kindergarten is the only time I ever got a time out. We had various tables and work surfaces around the classroom, and for lunch, we would pull up our tiny chairs to one of them and dig in. One of the tables had a large flat piece of Lego attached to it, so one could build figures and then attach them to the table. Obviously this was the cool table. Only 4 kids were allowed at the table for lunch, otherwise we would all squish in there and make a mess. One day I was lucky enough to get there first, and the table filled out in seconds. After we had gotten settled into our Dunkaroos and Lunchables, another kid waddled over to the table and sat down. I politely (read uppity know it all) told him that the table was full, and he would have to sit elsewhere. He said no. I repeated that it was a rule. You can’t break the &lt;em&gt;rules&lt;/em&gt;. He still said no. He wanted to eat lunch there. I don’t know what came over me, but I pushed him. Our teacher scrambled over after seeing this and asked what had happened. We both said our sides of the story. She said what the other kid did was breaking the rules, but what I did was more wrong. I was put on time out and not allowed to sit at the Lego table for the rest of the month. This was so confusing to me. The other kid had broken the rules! I even made sure that he knew he was doing wrong, it wasn’t a mistake or ignorance. I was just enforcing the law. I was like Batman. Batman doesn’t get put on time out, so why should I get all the punishment?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In fifth grade we had these booklets our teacher had made at the beginning of the year, with five random trivia or school topic questions for each day. First thing every morning we would come into the classroom and answer the questions as best we could, we all had the same questions. I was a bit ahead of my grade level at this time, so I did fairly well with the questions, and would frequently get all of them right. When we answered them, our teacher would go through the pile until he got to a book with all the answers right, and that kid would get to come to the front of the class and get to pick out a small prize. Now we’re talking penny candies, fancy pencils, or a sheet of stickers. Not riveting award material. At one point during the year I had a streak going. Somewhere around a week of me winning every day. One morning, our teacher was going through the pile and made a noise “Oh, got to Rachel’s!” he said.

I know I’m a mentally strong guy which is why I’ve been able to hide my sadness throughout the years to the point where my family haven’t noticed any problem with me, but it’s getting to the point now where I’m getting older and I’m gonna have to change as a person, and the fact I’m missing out on my teenage years because Of this really makes me sad because I know I have a lot more potential within my life. I even get socially awkward around my family sometimes it’s ridiculous, but The one thing I’ve never done is get help, and I feel like it’s too late to get help because it’s impossible for a therapists words to cure my social problems&lt;/p&gt;

I’m agnostic. I used to be religious and all that jazz but things change, right? They don’t know that I’m agnostic so I kinda cringe when they remind me that I should do the rosary and pray and all that stuff all because I grew up going to a catholic school.

I haven’t self-harmed in weeks, so I guess that’s alright? The urge is sometimes there though, creeping in and out. The same goes for my suicidal thoughts. I have already written my suicide letter. But I don’t know, really. I sometimes feel fine, then sad as fuck, then numb.

I also feel like a fucking fraud. I no longer really enjoy the stuff that I usually do, which is music, art, and writing. I just want to sleep for long time or just die. I hate it.

I'm 21 and I still live at home, which isn't anything to be ashamed of... but most people doing that have a job or theyre in college. I have been abused by my dad since I was 5 years old, mentally, emotionally, verbally and sometimes physically. I have got it on video, voice recordings, and even live on the phone with my mom, but she REFUSES to take me seriously when I beg her to let me stay with her while I look for a job. I have no money, no one i can stay with, i have no job, im not in college. I have had major depression and anxiety since I was about 11, and as some of you know that can severely halt your growth if undiagnosed for too long, which it was. I wasn't diagnosed (misdiagnosed with ADD) until i was 14 and I begun proper treatment, but that wasn't enough time to help me cope and work through my motivation issues and how id made exactly zero plans for the future. When I was 15 I attempted to overdose because of the abuse from my dad but also my depression that was taking over my life, the only reason I'm still here is I texted my friend about it to tell her a goodbye and she had her mom call my mom, and my mom found me after id taken the pills. They took me seriously for a short time after realizing just how bad I was doing but soon it shifted back to denying everything I said. They took me seriously again after they found out I had started self harming but my mom threatened to put me in a mental institution so i never confided in her again about my issues. (i have been clean for a while). Cut to last July, I had a job for a while but I ended up having to leave due to some issues at the company and while searching for a new job COVID blew up and the quarantine came down so I am still unable to safely search and go work as I am already dealing with plenty of health problems and I cannot risk getting covid19.

Now I am still living with my dad and feeling so ridiculously hopeless, angry, ignored and like a complete and utter failure. I know my family sees me as the pathetic screw up because my siblings went to college on scholarships, now my sister is married with a baby and a great job and my brother is also married working on starting his own company... and im at home playing games all day unable to break my depression cycle.

I dont leave my room unless I'm sure my dad is in his room, I pray every day he will just die because at this point its legitimately the only way anyone will let me cut him out of my damn life. He screams at me and calls me lazy, stupid, faking my depression, fat, etc. Its been like this for 16 years. I have explained it multiple ways to my mom and she still won't listen. I finally admitted flat out if I have to remain in this environment I feel like i could potentially harm myself again because of how hopeless my life feels and how miserable I am here and theres no clear end in sight. She said I cant stay with her because ""our dogs just don't get along :("" her dog is a puppy that isn't violent to my dog and my dog is just a little older than her and has really zero interest in her- they get along fine, they just need to be around each other more than once a month.

When my Grandma died the doctor told that she died from malnutrition . His Wife was a Lunatic Bitch to my Grandma and to my Mom . His family treated my family badly and made fun of me since young age. 

So, When my Grandma Died few years ago , his family completely cut ties from our family and then my Cousin got married and they didn't invite us . So , basically we don't talk because they don't want to have ties with us.

I also found out that My Moms Brother was really sorry and wanted to meet us in his last days but his family didn't let him. When My Dad asked them about when is the funeral they said don't come because they might have Covid-19 too.

So , 1 week passes by and now I find out that many members of their family have the virus but His Wife does not.

,depression,"Note: i am seeing a psychologist- i just want to to rant and see if anyone else feels like this?  


I was a 5 year old boy who didn't want to let go of his mom on the first day of school, i hated it. I drifted around that playground for months with no friends, i was quiet and had no confidence, it was hell. I would watch the adults outside the school fence going about their business and yearned to be older, i wanted to be away from school.  


I would begin to bash my head against the brick wall at recess and lunchtime, not until it bled but so i bruised. The nurse would let me sit inside every day and she would talk to me, at that time i think she was my only friend.I eventually met a kid who had a nervous twitch and thick glasses, his name was connor and we got along really well, he liked me for the quiet awkward kid i was. He introduced me to other people, but they didn't like me, i was ridiculed and i never stuck up for myself.  


I don't know when it happened, it could of been when i started watching cartoons, but i developed this mask to cover my authentic self, the mask was humour, i became a comedian. People began to love me , they didn't bully me anymore, and my friends grew! I loved being the funny man, my marks at school always suffered in my life from this point, because making others laugh was more important than anything, it validated me, it gave me a sense of worth.  


This continued and as the years rolled on  i got better at being the comedian, but to my dismay so did other people and by the time me and my friends got to high school my humour took a backseat to other peoples. I would be racing with other kids to make everyone laugh and become popular, i enjoyed the comedian of the month award a few times, but won it less and began to feel depression and started to have frequent suicidal thoughts, my worth had evaporated.  


I moved to Australia from the UK when i was 13, i could have burnt the mask that was causing me so much pain, but i clung onto it because it was all i knew. The cycle in Australia wasn't as frequent but i noticed that my head would begin to overheat, i began to feel exhausted and mentally tired, i was burnt out trying to be the comedian that everyone wanted and loved.  


I finished year 12 and as a 17 year old i began to party hard, i would  drink heavily to avoid the burnout i was experiencing with my comedy routine and it worked brilliantly, i didn't felt tired  and i made people laugh ten times as hard, it was all fake, but it's what i thought i  needed.  


Things changed when i became an alcoholic and had to explain to the court why my drunken rampage of destruction happened, that lead to me doing $10,000 of damage to an office. I got an 18 months suspended sentence and was ordered to got to AA , i am 4 years sober now.  


You would think my sobriety would help my life and it did to a degree, but the problem was that i can no longer maintain this mask and the burnout returned. It got so bad that making people laugh didn't even make me feel happy anymore, i felt like a prostitute, selling every inch of my soul for small nuggets of validation. 

I sometimes feel like i am losing my friends, because the mask i wear is falling apart, my jokes are repetitive, my resolve to tell them is weakening,and every time i socialise with someone i'm reminded of the fact that the very thing that gives me self worth is crumbling before my eyes and it has given me crippling social anxiety.  


All the friends i have today where made with the mask, my biggest fear is that i will one day lose the mask and then all of my friends, i begin to feel suicidal when i think like this. I went for a walk last week and i felt distraught, i sat under a tree at night  and notice a rope swing tied to the branch, i had to fight the urge to tie it around my neck and jump from the highest branch, the thought of this night is still fucking my head up this week.  


During COVID i moved in with my best friend from school, he loves my humour, but i feel like i have lost my edge and i am becoming boring as a person, my jokes get less laughs and my depression deepens. I suffer with ADHD and it use to feel like a gift,enabling me to chat to anyone and have many laughs, now i am 28 and i feel it just pisses people off. It makes them look at me and reflect how tedious it is to talk to me, i feel like a burden and some days it feels like the world would be a better place if i wasn't here anymore to watch everything i know fall apart around me.   


I don't want to be a quiet, awkward person , because deep down i know i'm still this quiet 5 year old who will end up with no friends eventually, and it makes me feel like ending it all. How can you take off a mask that you have worn for 23 years, how can you change your unhealthy understanding of feeling worth through others, how can you stop feeling like everyone around you is slowly begging to hate you because you are no longer the person who they met when you became friends?

I’ve been overthinking like a fool.

I know that’s not good

But I don’t know what to do to lighten up the mood

,depression,"Hey guys, 

I really hoped that I would never have to make a post in this subreddit again because I thought I was finally done with my mental issues or whatever you want to call them, but here I am.

I'm currently 19 years old, and in my second to last year before starting high school (Dutch education system). I have been trying to pass this year like 3 times now. 

I'm about to not pass it again most likely. There is still a chance that I may pass, but I really doubt it. 

I just don't know what to do anymore. I hate this. I hate not being able to go on with my life. I just want to pass this fucking stupid school year for once. Why the FUCK did Corona have to come and make it so my school turned into one big mess.

I just don't know. I am certain that I will kill myself if I don't pass this year. To give some context, I have been depressed ever since the age of 9. I overcame it mostly last summer, but after losing my grand parents earlier this year (who meant more to me than my parents. I love my parents, but not as much as I loved my grand parents) and perhaps not passing this year, once again, I want nothing other than to fucking end myself.

I lost my grandmother to cancer. I still am not over it, nowhere close. But the way I lost my grandfather was way more painful to me. He sent me my grandmother's inheritance (money), but I was so busy with school that it took me a couple of days to contact him and thank him for sending it.

That was a HUGE mistake. I should've known he was mentally unstable and very emotional because he lost his mind over the phone, and before I could ever make it up to him he killed himself. I am not the reason he killed himself, he just really wanted to be with his wife after 60+ years of being married, but I just never got to make up for it. I should've known, I should've called, but those 19 years of him being there for me even during my darkest times, I threw away by being an absolute fucking dumbass.

But back to the main subject, if I don't pass this year I just don't know what to do. I don't want to redo the year AGAIN. I don't want to go back into health care AGAIN. 

I just want to end it all. I hate work, and I hate this school year.

Everything sucks. Life is boring, I don't have any friends, nobody cares enough to check in on me, if I dropped dead nobody would even notice. I don't matter. I'm overweight, short, fucking ugly, and too stupid to get through the basic level of college coursework. I can't hold a relationship, my last one ended in her cheating and me plunging into a year-long spiral of depression that I don't know if I will ever recover from. I have been diagnosed with PTSD, Major Depressive Disorder, General Anxiety Disorder, and even more shit on top of that shit sandwich. Two of my cats died, my grandmother died of cancer, and my childhood dog got split in half by a speeding truck that didn't even stop. I'd say I want everything to stop, but nothing would even change. I'm just stuck in the minutia of getting up and doing nothing but sleeping and wishing I'd cease to exist.

&lt;p&gt;Everything sucks. Life is boring, I don&amp;#39;t have any friends, nobody cares enough to check in on me, if I dropped dead nobody would even notice. I don&amp;#39;t matter. I&amp;#39;m overweight, short, fucking ugly, and too stupid to get through the basic level of college coursework. I can&amp;#39;t hold a relationship, my last one ended in her cheating and me plunging into a year-long spiral of depression that I don&amp;#39;t know if I will ever recover from. I have been diagnosed with PTSD, Major Depressive Disorder, General Anxiety Disorder, and even more shit on top of that shit sandwich. Two of my cats died, my grandmother died of cancer, and my childhood dog got split in half by a speeding truck that didn&amp;#39;t even stop. I&amp;#39;d say I want everything to stop, but nothing would even change. I&amp;#39;m just stuck in the minutia of getting up and doing nothing but sleeping and wishing I&amp;#39;d cease to exist.&lt;/p&gt;

I'm a 32 year-old guy from the UK and I've not been 100% sure I'm suffering with depression.  


I have been a father for almost 4 years, I've been married for over 2 years and my career is going well. I have a beautiful house and an awesome dog.  


It starts when I fell in love 10 years ago, I moved out of my parents into a small apartment an hour away from all my friends and family just to be closer to a girl. After 2 years we got engaged and 2 years after that we got pregnant, and a while after that we got married, a big elaborate wedding we could not afford. Money problems started, so I had to leave my job which I loved, with people I genuinely loved too. I got a job in London and started working 60 hour weeks, it made me miserable but I am the provider and my happiness doesn't matter as long as my wife and son are happy.  


Fast forward to a year ago, I'm getting angry for no reason, I feel alone as I have 0 friends, my wife and I no longer love eachother, I no longer like going out the house with my wife and son. I have no hobbies, nothing. I'm a different man from a few years and I fucking hate myself for it. I'm always angry.

I already struggle to focus on work at home, my brain is all over the place and I just end up sitting in front of the task rereading the sentences 10 times because they just go through my head and then disappear. It's like a strong mental blockage. I've just been sitting frozen in front of it just to then break down sobbing about it, it makes me feel so stupid and I'm very worried about my final grades. I'm not even sure if it is my depression or my cptsd, but I feel miserable about not being able to do this. My therapist hasn't exactly been helpful. ""That is strange."" Yeah no shit, thanks.

I want to send my professor an email but I don't know how to say it.

I was doing so great before the virus, but then it came and I lost my job, then my class got postponed for a month, and I gained 26 pounds. Just barely I've been able to get the class portion finished and get into the internship portion, I've been under so much stress and it feels like I'm in a depressive tailspin that I can't stop.

I've had major suicidal ideation issues since I was 14 and someone very close to me passed away unexpectedly, but there were still problems with that even beforehand due to multiple shitty father figures and borderline neglect.

Every day I think about ending my own life. Every single time there's a problem or an obstacle or something bad going on in the world I think about how much easier it would be if I was dead or how much I just want to stop existing. The voice in my head telling me to do it never shuts up and I can't even remember a time when it wasn't there.

I know I need help but the last therapist I talked to just wasn't for me and I don't know how to find another one that will work with my family's insurance.

The thought of that happening to me and me saying it doing something like that to my girlfriend scares the shit out of me. I feel like there's nothing I can do but keep going and hope that when I can finish school and move in with my girlfriend that I'll spontaneously get better with the lifestyle change.

I feel like there&amp;#39;s nothing I can do but keep going and hope that when I can finish school and move in with my girlfriend that I&amp;#39;ll spontaneously get better with the lifestyle change.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sorry for the long-ish post, I&amp;#39;m just kind of venting. If you have any advice or support, it&amp;#39;s definitely appreciated.&lt;/p&gt;

,depression,"Hi all, I’m a 24 F who was diagnosed with depression, anxiety, and ADHD about 5 years ago. Over the course of my life I’ve developed very strong emotional attachments to a few works of fiction, and one IRL band, where caring about and emulating them became a primary focus and I felt an intense need to be closer to them. For example, in middle and high school I was very attached to the original assassins creed series, and would wear leather boots and modern clothes with styles that made me feel like I was an “assassin.” On a school summer abroad trip to Rome and Florence I was overwhelmed by being in the setting of the game and seeing so many familiar things, more than I was simply by being in a historically significant place. The fact that there were so many similarities between the story and its settings and real life made it difficult to get distance from the fiction.

Every time I become attached to fiction and it ends, I feel overwhelming grief and confusion. For me right now, I had decided to rewatch avatar the last airbender on Netflix a few days ago. I watched all of the first and second season as a kid but aged out of watching Nickelodeon constantly right around when the third season came out, so I never saw the end of the story.

I have been very isolated from friends in the last couple of years. The peak of my depression was for about two years from 2015-2017 that I honestly can’t remember 60% of, and it’s hard to tell the rest of my memories from anxiety dreams and reality, because I was always hiding in my room or extremely dissociated. I had to leave college and come home because I dropped out of so many classes. So I’ve been emotionally detached and numb for quite a while. 

In the beginning of watching ATLA I felt so much peace, like I was a kid again and I had no problems in the entire world. I honestly wanted to cry from the joy of feeling the release and freedom from so much stress that I carry, because of depression and because of work and home life that are also really stressful and even fucked up sometimes. 

As I got to the third season, I became a lot more emotionally invested in the characters, and the story ending left a gaping hole. Not to mention that like I did when I was a kid, I got super emotionally attached to Zuko. I think part of this is because I haven’t really cared about anyone IRL in a long time and I was really vulnerable to emotions, more than I have been in a couple years, while watching it. So for whatever reason the grief of the show ending, right now, years after it actually did, makes me so sad. I tried to watch Korra and couldn’t bear it since so many characters were dead. Time passing is also a huge trigger for my emotions and sadness because of all the time I lost to depression.

I just can’t help being hyper-fixated right now when there isn’t really a reason to be (it’s fiction, and I know it is) and I think it’s because the emotions I felt because of the show (empathy, joy, peace, admiration) are emotions i really have not had in a long time. The first thing I wanted to do was get out of my rut, go for a walk, try to get in better shape, try to get back to school, but these things have had huge barriers to me for years because of my MIs and resulting fear. So I’m scared that I’m in a short manic period because of the emotions that were unlocked, and that I’m only going to let myself down hard again.

Anyway. This has been a ramble. I don’t really have anyone to share the silly connections to a show that would make these feelings more lighthearted and ground them in reality, so I’m feeling lost and really sad.",t2_36pqjyba,False,,0,False,"Getting over-attached to fiction, feeling immense loss and confusion when finishing it",[],r/depression,False,0,,0,,False,t3_h85qwe,False,dark,1.0,,public,1,0,{},,False,[],,False,False,,{},,False,1,,False,,False,,[],{},,True,,1592076251.0,text,0,,,text,self.depression,False,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hi all, I’m a 24 F who was diagnosed with depression, anxiety, and ADHD about 5 years ago.

,depression,"I’ll use this to vent and maybe someone has any sort of advice.
Just a bit of backstory, I am a 21f, I have been in my studio for the past two months of lockdown basically alone, besides seeing my girlfriend. Besides the postman/receptionist I haven’t had face-to-face contact in 2 months now. I have been calling my friends and working from home which has allowed me to speak to others. There is hope for the future, my best friend is moving down here in August and probably visiting in July but theres still a bit of time till that. I think i’m a bit confused in my relationship, i love this girl to bits but maybe being the only person ive seen for the last couple months has made me a bit irritated by her behaviour, shes really loud and immature a lot of the time but i don’t want to seem ‘boring’ so i go along with it even though i recently haven’t had the energy to. Theres also quite a few problems i had with her, she smokes weed basically everyday but has majorly cut down the amount since i told her that it bothers me around the start of this year. I smoke myself, but never to that extent. She also is on antidepressants and had a lot of shit happen to her in the past, with her family, dad being an addict, siblings depressed and all but i won’t go too much into that. Of course she vents to me and i feel like maybe the sadness rubs off sometimes but i want to be strong for her so i try not to show it. Her friends are also very immature, one of her best friends is a complete stoner living with his mum, and the other is currently getting married to a girl just to basically ride off her money and they’ve also just decided to be in an open relationship which i found very immature as that girl has a kid, but i tried not getting myself involved. My gf does seem quite ambitious, but its been a while and she hasn’t really
tried doing anything besides playing xbox and smoking weed and working (at a care home), i know its a lock down but she was like that before too tbh. She keeps talking about fixing her guitar and eventually playing again, and maybe even getting into a book (she told me she never really reads and i told her she should try it out even tho i don’t do it often when i do it feels very rewarding and makes you wiser). I should point out we are very different when it comes to the way we were raised, i had a very supportive family and went to a good school/uni etc. Some of her friends really seem like inbreds the other day i saw a video of them a few years ago biting off a snails head and it pissed me the fuck off, she was laughing in the back, but claimed to be completely different now and that she was with the wrong crowd. Thing is i know her and the her i know is a really sweet and caring person. The lockdown has also been making my self esteem go down and i made myself sick the other day when i thought i ate too much. Thats happened a few times in the past but i try to control it and not go back to it. I feel like maybe i just had a lot on my shoulders this last year or so.

Every few days i seem to get this wave of sadness/numbness that hit in the evening, and is actually more common when my gf is over maybe because when we have sex more hormones are released (not sure if that has anything to do with it but these last couple nights i cried after sex). It confuses me because generally in the day time i feel good, even really happy at times and i keep myself busy. But it feels like this sadness/numbness is becoming more frequent. The other night when i was on my own i meditated and felt so much better it felt like i fought off that wave of sadness and felt so content before bed. I can’t meditate every night though and still want to know why i’m feeling like this.

,depression,"Nothing changed for someone like me during the quarantine. I didn’t have friends before so it’s not like I missed seeing anyone besides the guy I hook up with on occasion. Quarantine is slowly being lifted, which is fine, but then I’ll be reminded how alone I am again. It’s a continuation of me being pathetic, sitting alone in my room, drinking a beer and realizing I have nothing to look forward to. I can’t even cry anymore. 

People just think I’m dumb or the second banana or too quiet, too good. I just fucking exist. It’s not terrible in the sense that I’m in an abusive place and I truly feel for others that are in a worse situation. Knowing that just makes me feel more pathetic. That I have nothing to offer, the plainest of Janes. It’s not even sadness, just frustration. I’m terrified of making new connections anyway because, what I thought was my closest, and longest connection betrayed me in a way that I think I need to acknowledge really fucked me up. Not that it matters, people just forget I’m there anyway and then I just make them mad.

Trigger warning:
I wore shorts the other day and though it wasn’t like I hadn’t worn shorts before, the lighting I saw on my legs this time caught my attention.

I didn’t have friends before so it’s not like I missed seeing anyone besides the guy I hook up with on occasion. Quarantine is slowly being lifted, which is fine, but then I’ll be reminded how alone I am again. It’s a continuation of me being pathetic, sitting alone in my room, drinking a beer and realizing I have nothing to look forward to. I can’t even cry anymore. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;People just think I’m dumb or the second banana or too quiet, too good. I just fucking exist. It’s not terrible in the sense that I’m in an abusive place and I truly feel for others that are in a worse situation. Knowing that just makes me feel more pathetic. That I have nothing to offer, the plainest of Janes. It’s not even sadness, just frustration. I’m terrified of making new connections anyway because, what I thought was my closest, and longest connection betrayed me in a way that I think I need to acknowledge really fucked me up. Not that it matters, people just forget I’m there anyway and then I just make them mad.&lt;/p&gt;

I stayed for another month in the relationship as every time I tried to leave she begged me not to go as I “couldn’t do this to her while her mother had cancer” which she threw in my face constantly, calling me a “piece of shit” for trying to leave her while her mum was ill (a few of my friends saw her shout at me once and have told me about it since, seeing as I had forgot) I managed to leave the relationship and I got back with my ex shortly after (I know that’s bad, I’m not saying I’m perfect).

But then I would constantly see abuse on her Instagram story aimed at me, calling me “fat” and saying I had a “dad bod” or telling a ex of mine I’m not longer in contact with I’m 4 years older than I am and I was on heroin, which has since made this ex think I’m a creep as she believes this is true...

I see other artists younger than me (i'm 22) getting internships at places like Riot Games or Blizzard like it's nothing. I have no clue how these people are so motivated and consistent to keep posting artwork every single day...

Currently my only income is through commissions. But unfortunately i'm only recognized for my pornographic art. I have 5.5k+ followers on my porn art twitter account, which climbs ever so slightly whenever i post something new. While on the other hand i have a passion project account where i post artwork for my story, maybe one or two pieces every month, with around 100 followers. But nobody cares because it's not sex or fan art.

I can't bring myself to just pump out tons of artwork for my project. I feel like if i did it would maybe get recognized and some people iterested to want to commission for normal art, rather than porn, or at least buy my artwork of the project rather than the porn.

I have to force myself to draw, sometimes i wonder if i should just try and find something new to get interested in, but to be quite honest i think i'm pretty good at art. I just am plain and simply not motivated to draw.

I don't know what to do, it's a point where i WILL NOT get an internship or job at one of these companies because i have no work in my portfolio to show. I'm concerned i never will in time. I feel like i'll end up working some boring job at Best Buy (example) for years until i finally get a big enough following to support myself with my art alone.

I spend 9 hours a day being treated like an absolute subhuman by everybody I encounter. I have no hope for the future and I am on tracks to an early grave.

My job makes me depressed. I hate most of the people I work with. They're petty, odious, stupid little creatures. My wage is terrible and I live in a bad area surrounded by bad people. I don't feel intellectually or existentially fulfilled and I am not even close to realising my full potential. I feel like I have so much to offer but nobody is interested in what I have. I can't pursue hobbies or interests because the emotional dissonance from work drains me psychologically and I spend my fragmented spare time lying on the floor staring at the wall or ceiling waiting for the day to end.

I can't afford to quit because I need to pay rent. During lockdown I began studying another degree in an attempt to break into another industry, so I must keep paying for that. Naturally, since returning to work, I feel very demoralised about this whole thing anyway.

I wish I had the courage to kill myself. I realised when I was 17 that I was never going to be happy but I never realised things were going to get this bad. I have no future. Do you know how hard it is to get out of bed, let alone force yourself to do something you hate for 6 days a week, when you have no hope for the future? You can endure misery if you think it's going to pay off one day. I've sacrificed so, so much already. So much time. So many opportunities. All in pursuit of education that got me nowhere.

I've started exhibiting some rather serious physical symptoms. I can't sleep. My anxiety is so bad I feel like I'm a gentle nudge away from a panic attack all of the time. I have such strong anxiety that I have constant chest, back and neck pains. I have heart palpitations on a daily basis. I feel like it's just a matter of time before I have a stroke or a heart attack.

I've thought about death and dying almost every day since late 2017. It's all I think about. I just want the lights to go out. I feel an overwhelming resentment to the rest of the world for the fate it has bestowed upon me. I feel anger and hate towards anybody who is ahead of me, especially if they're less industrious than I am. Resentment is a difficult emotion. It's even more difficult when it's justified. I feel like nothing matters other than luck, and I've been so unlucky so far that I can never recover.

&lt;p&gt;My job makes me depressed. I hate most of the people I work with. They&amp;#39;re petty, odious, stupid little creatures. My wage is terrible and I live in a bad area surrounded by bad people. I don&amp;#39;t feel intellectually or existentially fulfilled and I am not even close to realising my full potential. I feel like I have so much to offer but nobody is interested in what I have. I can&amp;#39;t pursue hobbies or interests because the emotional dissonance from work drains me psychologically and I spend my fragmented spare time lying on the floor staring at the wall or ceiling waiting for the day to end.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I can&amp;#39;t afford to quit because I need to pay rent. During lockdown I began studying another degree in an attempt to break into another industry, so I must keep paying for that. Naturally, since returning to work, I feel very demoralised about this whole thing anyway.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I wish I had the courage to kill myself. I realised when I was 17 that I was never going to be happy but I never realised things were going to get this bad. I have no future. Do you know how hard it is to get out of bed, let alone force yourself to do something you hate for 6 days a week, when you have no hope for the future? You can endure misery if you think it&amp;#39;s going to pay off one day. I&amp;#39;ve sacrificed so, so much already. So much time. So many opportunities. All in pursuit of education that got me nowhere.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve started exhibiting some rather serious physical symptoms. I can&amp;#39;t sleep. My anxiety is so bad I feel like I&amp;#39;m a gentle nudge away from a panic attack all of the time. I have such strong anxiety that I have constant chest, back and neck pains. I have heart palpitations on a daily basis. I feel like it&amp;#39;s just a matter of time before I have a stroke or a heart attack.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve thought about death and dying almost every day since late 2017. It&amp;#39;s all I think about. I just want the lights to go out. I feel an overwhelming resentment to the rest of the world for the fate it has bestowed upon me. I feel anger and hate towards anybody who is ahead of me, especially if they&amp;#39;re less industrious than I am. Resentment is a difficult emotion. It&amp;#39;s even more difficult when it&amp;#39;s justified. I feel like nothing matters other than luck, and I&amp;#39;ve been so unlucky so far that I can never recover. I&amp;#39;ve slipped through the cracks and I&amp;#39;m too far behind.&lt;/p&gt;

,depression,"Hello all. I (32M) am in the middle of a fairly severe depressive episode and I'm posting to Reddit for the first time ever because I just don't know what else to do. I'll apologize here for the fact that the following will likely be a jumbled mess of streamed conscious thought. Bear with me...

 For some background, I've been suffering from severe depression and anxiety for nearly my entire life. Unfortunately, my mental illness has become the prime definer of my existence, even before I really knew what was going on. I have been in and out of treatment for nearly 14 years now, both inpatient and outpatient. While these things sometimes help, it never lasts for very long as my mood, as well as my perceptive reality, can change at any moment for seemingly no real reason. I also have had issues with trauma related to my upbringing (only child/forced to be primary caretaker for mentally ill (paranoia) mother who eventually dies of cancer in my early 20s) that only works to compound my issue. I have lived a very solitary lifestyle this entire time. It started in childhood and was forced upon me, and I've been trying to fix that my whole life with mixed, and ultimately failed results. Every relationship of any kind has failed.

On the surface I probably seem fairly high functioning and a lot of people wouldn't even notice at first. At least that's usually how it goes. Over time (the few people that have ever tried or wanted to get to know me) as people get to know me more, they eventually lose interest and I inevitably get ghosted. This has been the pattern of nearly every relationship I have ever had. To a certain extent I understand. My mood and personality patterns can be very tiresome to people. No one likes a ""debbie downer"" and even less so when it seems to come out of no where and replaced the person they thought they liked in the first place. On the other side of the coin, my life circumstances and perceived hopelessness is easily misconstrued as me just being lazy. The fact that I am overweight (6'2 280lbs) serves as an easy confirmation bias for everyone. 

When I do reach out for help, I am usually met with eye rolls and quick, thoughtless suggestions. Exercise more, find a hobby (like that's realistic when you have no interests), join a club. As if I haven't done those things. 

My suicidal ideation is constant. Every single day, whether I am in a depressive episode or when I am feeling ""better"". The most frustrating thing is that I do come out of these episodes eventually. I never know how long an episode is going to last. Sometimes it's just a few days, other times it can be months. It always comes back though, and frankly over the last few years I have had a lot more bad days than good. So when I am feeling better I feel like I have to make up for all of the bad decisions and lack of life progression. It's exceedingly difficult as it seems like I have a week to make up for 3-4 months worth of an empty void, where I did absolutely nothing but be constantly miserable. 

Anyway, this is getting long and I know the internet doesn't like long so here's my plea:

I've just spent the last 5 hours locked in a mental spiral of wanting to kill myself and I just needed to reach out to someone, something, anything. I don't know what I expect out of this and I certainly don't want to fall into the ""just making a pity party"" trap. Fact is, I've tried everything and my life isn't any better now than it was 14 years ago. My future is bleak. I have minimal support and they are not very helpful. I feel unlovable, undesirable, and unwanted. I crave intimacy and closeness with others, but have never (ever) really attained it.

,depression,"I have never been more tired. 

I'm mentally exhausted. Lockdown has changed my job into a 24/7 nightmare and I feel like Sisyphus every day. It just never ends. I'm trying to keep routines and put hard stops on my work hours, but it just piles up or they ask for unreasonable time outside of what I'd usually give (8 hr workday normally). I love my job (most times lol), but I'm just empty. I'm still anxious about it all the time though. 

I'm physically exhausted. I throw up every morning. It's just bile, but it really makes every day harder. I'm planning on going to the doctor, but I've been nervous with everything going on. I have other compromised health issues that make me vulnerable to infection. My insomnia is horrible and I wake up to panic attacks or just violent vomiting. I think it's honestly stress. I know I need to go and I will, I'm just scared. 

I'm emotionally exhausted. I had to hurt and leave someone I loved, because they hurt me. They crossed every boundary I had and sexually assaulted me. I don't hate them, but I can't even let them hug me or be close to me without feeling honestly terrified. I know it's hurting them to be broken up, but they don't seem to really understand or internalize the damage their actions caused me. I feel like I'm raw and open and bleeding out. I'm healing, but every time I make a step forward I'm flung backwards. I'm not acting like myself anymore. Insert yellow wallpaper reference here. I heard they tried to kill themselves after we split. I desperately want to reach out and give kindness. I don't want them to not live, I just can't have them be a person in my life that way again, if at all. Why can't they see that? It breaks my heart, I still care about them and love them, but I just cannot be in their life like that after what they did to me. I think about it every day and I'm gutted.

I'm exhausted spiritually. I have always struggled with depression and anxiety. I have PTSD from my happy childhood. This isn't new. Healing is a well traveled, messy road my feet are always traveling. I'm just tried of this path, this journey. I need things to change, and I need to change. I'm ready, but I'm also so empty I have no energy to do the things I know would help me. I am in therapy and my therapist is honestly an incredible, wonderful gift in my life. I have so much to be grateful for, why can't I just let myself stop dwelling on the past? 

I guess I'm just putting it out there, hoping it'll help to put it somewhere other than my unicorn journal. I don't need anyone to fix it for me, but I just thought about kinship. If you're struggling too, and you're tired, I just want you to know I see you. Please don't give up. You are sunshine and some day things will be better.

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m mentally exhausted. Lockdown has changed my job into a 24/7 nightmare and I feel like Sisyphus every day. It just never ends. I&amp;#39;m trying to keep routines and put hard stops on my work hours, but it just piles up or they ask for unreasonable time outside of what I&amp;#39;d usually give (8 hr workday normally). I love my job (most times lol), but I&amp;#39;m just empty. I&amp;#39;m still anxious about it all the time though. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m physically exhausted. I throw up every morning. It&amp;#39;s just bile, but it really makes every day harder. I&amp;#39;m planning on going to the doctor, but I&amp;#39;ve been nervous with everything going on. I have other compromised health issues that make me vulnerable to infection. My insomnia is horrible and I wake up to panic attacks or just violent vomiting. I think it&amp;#39;s honestly stress. I know I need to go and I will, I&amp;#39;m just scared. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m emotionally exhausted. I had to hurt and leave someone I loved, because they hurt me. They crossed every boundary I had and sexually assaulted me. I don&amp;#39;t hate them, but I can&amp;#39;t even let them hug me or be close to me without feeling honestly terrified. I know it&amp;#39;s hurting them to be broken up, but they don&amp;#39;t seem to really understand or internalize the damage their actions caused me. I feel like I&amp;#39;m raw and open and bleeding out. I&amp;#39;m healing, but every time I make a step forward I&amp;#39;m flung backwards. I&amp;#39;m not acting like myself anymore. Insert yellow wallpaper reference here. I heard they tried to kill themselves after we split. I desperately want to reach out and give kindness. I don&amp;#39;t want them to not live, I just can&amp;#39;t have them be a person in my life that way again, if at all. Why can&amp;#39;t they see that? It breaks my heart, I still care about them and love them, but I just cannot be in their life like that after what they did to me. I think about it every day and I&amp;#39;m gutted.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m exhausted spiritually. I have always struggled with depression and anxiety. I have PTSD from my happy childhood. This isn&amp;#39;t new. Healing is a well traveled, messy road my feet are always traveling. I&amp;#39;m just tried of this path, this journey. I need things to change, and I need to change. I&amp;#39;m ready, but I&amp;#39;m also so empty I have no energy to do the things I know would help me. I am in therapy and my therapist is honestly an incredible, wonderful gift in my life. I have so much to be grateful for, why can&amp;#39;t I just let myself stop dwelling on the past? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I guess I&amp;#39;m just putting it out there, hoping it&amp;#39;ll help to put it somewhere other than my unicorn journal. I don&amp;#39;t need anyone to fix it for me, but I just thought about kinship. If you&amp;#39;re struggling too, and you&amp;#39;re tired, I just want you to know I see you. Please don&amp;#39;t give up. You are sunshine and some day things will be better. They&amp;#39;re just not right now, and they may not be for some time. It&amp;#39;s hard to stay positive, but I bend every atom in my body to try to do so, because it&amp;#39;s what keeps me from the brink. I won&amp;#39;t go back there, not after all the work I&amp;#39;ve done. I hope you won&amp;#39;t, either.&lt;/p&gt;

,depression,"Before him.. I didn’t think about this stuff. I didn’t feel this stuff.. I was so dull.. this man opens me up in this world and then he lives me here to deal with all of this on my own...  

How could you do this to me...? I put my trust in you.. the trust I was never able to put in anyone. You lie to me about something I said I didn’t even care enough for to lose you. I would have went through anything to keep you..  

I have met so many people.. but never have I felt the connection I did with you. Not even remotely close, and never will I feel close to that again. Even if it were once possible, I refuse to try again. You have broken my heart, and you will keep it for no one will ever take that place. I will not allow it. This is how much I liked you..  

You told me that you were going to kill yourself if I did not meet you.. I thought that I found someone as alone and fucked up as I am... I was so afraid to meet you because of this. I already knew that I liked you when all of my years I have not liked anyone. I knew you would hurt me because nothing in my life ever goes well in the end.  

James, you leave me here alone in a world that I thought I had you. You leave me to feel anything for once in my life, despite my disputes.. you gave me the only happiness I have ever had, the only moment in my life that I can look back at and know that that was the best of it all.. for this I am grateful.

&lt;p&gt;How could you do this to me...? I put my trust in you.. the trust I was never able to put in anyone. You lie to me about something I said I didn’t even care enough for to lose you. I would have went through anything to keep you..  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have met so many people.. but never have I felt the connection I did with you. Not even remotely close, and never will I feel close to that again. Even if it were once possible, I refuse to try again. You have broken my heart, and you will keep it for no one will ever take that place. I will not allow it. This is how much I liked you..  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You told me that you were going to kill yourself if I did not meet you.. I thought that I found someone as alone and fucked up as I am... I was so afraid to meet you because of this. I already knew that I liked you when all of my years I have not liked anyone. I knew you would hurt me because nothing in my life ever goes well in the end.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;James, you leave me here alone in a world that I thought I had you. You leave me to feel anything for once in my life, despite my disputes.. you gave me the only happiness I have ever had, the only moment in my life that I can look back at and know that that was the best of it all.. for this I am grateful.  &lt;/p&gt;

,depression,"I'm so mad at myself for being depressed over something that many people consider immature. I have no idea on whether to call myself depressed because I've been told that my problem wasn't a big deal at all. The thing with me is I have a very bitch face and a lot of people misunderstands me for it, I'm sure that I'm not the only one going through this but I'm just over it. Yes, sometimes im very thankful that I have it I can avoid people and situations but everything has a down side to it. I've lived with this face ever since I was born, yes I do make an effort to change my resting face by smiling at people when they pass( to appear less ""bitchy""). With this face of mine I've been misunderstood a lot of times. Now this ""depression"" I have has been permanent though it's in phases. I would have trigger points about it. That just happens to be apologizing; I know that it sounds stupid writing this also makes me hate myself that something this little makes such a huge impact in my life. Everytime it triggers it is when I try to help, not to be narcissistic but rather I think of myself as a very loving and caring person. I'm very affectionate even though it is not physically and I try my best to help people. However it's always being taken for granted and when they get what they want the blame turns to me. Again back to my face it's very easy to misunderstand and the worst part about my problem is that no one ever comes to tell me face to face, it's always thrown around and talked around. I used to not care until people I really care about forces me to apologize to the other because I apparently hurt their feelings, I do as I'm told as they really care about the other person. This makes me question myself because no one ever really asks me my side of the story and ignores whatever I feel and continue to pressure me into apologizing. In the end I do as I'm told but later on I find myself crying about it because it's happened sooo many times and the past repeats itself again and again and everytime a new misunderstanding arises I think about the past again. I hate myself because when I think about it I laught at myself for being pathetic because this is immature of me since I'm not usually like this. I've tried to talk to others about it but it just repeats and I'm told that it's not a big deal. But for once I wish someone would come and ask about the whole story and about my feelings cause it's hard going through it again and again. The pressure of apologizing to someone you intended to help and someone you care for it hurts. More than some may think; it fucking hurts to know that your good will would always be taken for granted and instead of being thanked for someone just has to stab you in the back and pour the whole blame into you. I'm sorry if this sounds immature but it really has a sensitive spot in my life since it's been happening my whole life.

I just wanted to let my feelings out here. I'm sorry if some may think this is immature. Being threatened, pressured, and forced was what hurt me the most. If u are going through the same thing as me and crying yourself to sleep all the time please understand that u will get through this, we just need to learn how to handle it and make it through take what ruins you and make it into something that will help you grow and get stronger.

I dont want to interact anymore I just want to wake up without the extra voice beating me down. Speaking of sleep every single dream i have had lately is like a fucking movie made to purposely torture me when after waking up my head cant tell what part of the dream is real or fake. So here I go spewing my bullshit antics at the crowd this wasn&amp;#39;t no cry for help I just want to be alone&lt;/p&gt;

,depression,"Hello, around 3 years ago when I was about 17 years old my mother out of the blue started being very quiet she never went out of the house and sometimes was very paranoid.

She took of smoke detectors because there was a red light on them I assume she was scared of it for whatever reason, and once said that someone had followed her to our house in a car but when asked about it she just said ""I don't know"", she very often was very very quiet and I heard my parents discuss her mental state pretty often which resulted in her just crying.

Long story short she tried committing suicide (she only tried it this only time never again) while we were all sleeping but we found her and she survived.

After she got out of the hospital she was recovering (and still is some injuries) so around a half year after being out she started seeming normal again, she started to go out again was happy, talked more and was pretty much like she had been all her life.

Up until around 3 months ago that was the case, now she hasn't gone out of the house again, not even to take out the trash, she is very very quiet and seems lost in her thoughts.

An example of that is that I sometimes speak to her and she only responds with some words or a tone, also I don't know why but some weeks ago when we were eating I told a joke and everyone was laughing but my mother looked at me in a very weird way as if she didn't understand it or as if joking wouldn't be allowed, yesterday the same thing happened when my father made a joke about me (which was funny) and my mother got very mad at my dad for whatever reason I don't really understand.

She does not work and only does the work at home but because of covid me and my sister are at home and now because she started always being so weak my sister and I take care of the housework.

When I want to go outside I always tell my parents that I am going outside but now for whatever reason my mother started having very delusional thoughts, I asked her about why I shouldn't go outside with my friends but she always says ""I don't know"", if she says something weird she always says ""I don't know"" if confronted about it.

The only thing she does right now is sew and sometimes I ask her ""Why not read a book?"" but now I fear that I might make her mad or something I don't want to mess her up mentally.

Recently she covered up the laptop camera with tape and I am really scared that she maybe again has paranoid thoughts just like she had when she took of every fire detector 3 years ago.

The problem is that my mother and my father are very traditional religious and conservative they don't ""believe"" in psychotherapy, my mother would rather pray than get true help for her mental problems.

If my country recovers from covid and everything starts opening up again me and my sister will be in university most of the day, my father will be at work and my mother will be at home without anyone talking to her or comforting her which god forbid might lead to her feeling lonely and wanting to committing suicide again also if its not that my mother would emotionally be destroyed if my grandma dies (she is very old) because beside us its the only part of her family she has.

Does anyone reading this please have some advice for me?

,depression,"Hello, I’m very new here and I was just looking for advice.
I’m 20 years old and I’ve been struggling with depression for about two years or maybe longer I don’t even know anymore. I believe it’s the culmination of an abnormal childhood, birth defects(8 fingers, no thumbs, no wrist movement, no radial bone in right arm etc.) and social problems that come from it. I still live a fairly normal life (friends, go to school, club sports etc.) however I have lingering thoughts of killing myself everyday and struggle with chronic loneliness. I’ve been in and out of counseling for two years with temporary results. After getting tired of feeling this way I told my general care provider and he gave me Prozac 20mg. I took it for about 8 months (April-December 2019). My suicidal thoughts and constant loneliness lingered so I decided to stop taking them.

I’m 20 years old and I’ve been struggling with depression for about two years or maybe longer I don’t even know anymore. I believe it’s the culmination of an abnormal childhood, birth defects(8 fingers, no thumbs, no wrist movement, no radial bone in right arm etc.) and social problems that come from it. I still live a fairly normal life (friends, go to school, club sports etc.) however I have lingering thoughts of killing myself everyday and struggle with chronic loneliness. I’ve been in and out of counseling for two years with temporary results. After getting tired of feeling this way I told my general care provider and he gave me Prozac 20mg. I took it for about 8 months (April-December 2019). My suicidal thoughts and constant loneliness lingered so I decided to stop taking them. I’ve been doing okay recently however my thoughts and loneliness have just been voices in my head I’ve tolerated coexisting with. Is it worth trying to start a new antidepressant or up my previous dosage of Prozac? I just don’t know anymore I feel broken and can’t even comprehend how depressed I really am. Thanks to whoever takes the time to read this and answer.&lt;/p&gt;

,depression,"I started a reddit to post in this group. Honestly, just want a space to share where i'm not scared of someone trying to make me better after. It's why i've stopped talking to friends and family and try my best to don the charade of joy. They're smart enough to see through it, just not the whole way through.

I've been going in and out of severe depression fro the last fifteen years at least. I turn 29 at the end of July. For so long it was this bobbing in and out of depression, from actually enjoying life to being unable to find any energy to even take a shower and constantly thinking about different ways to end my life. From jumping, wrist slitting, pills, or a gun. I tried to take my own life a year and a few months ago. My psychiatrist had prescribed Ambien in conjunction with my Bupropion, in case a side-effect of anxiety caused me to lose sleep. I sat down with a cigar, my favorite beer, and drank all I had, which was a surplus. I woke up over a day later from my two best friends banging on my door. There was puke and I'm pretty sure I sleep walked because my bathroom was covered in piss and I had bruises on my shoulders from possibly bumping into walls. They had no reason to think I was trying to take my  own life the night before, nor did they go into my room or see anything, and i had cleaned up the bathroom before i let them in. I just hadn't picked up my phone and they know I get sad.

I'm extremely lucky, I have friends... real friends who although I don't see every day or talk to often I can open up to them, enough to count on more than one hand. I have family who I know will feel a hole in their life if I do decide to take my own life again. Part of me think that's a narcissistic thing to say. Maybe. Recently I bought a gun for the sole purpose of pointing at my temple and pulling the trigger. I sleep with it next to my bed now. Honestly, if it were not for Netflix and video games I think i might have done something about that now.

Was recently given a joint, smoked some. Very little, although I used to smoke heavily and often, I've become a lightweight. Getting high made me realize just how little fun it is to exist in my head. How little of a friend I am to myself. I have been trying for a long fucking time to be a friend. To be someone who doesn't inexplicably hate himself. I'm honestly not sure if it's possible. As many times as I've heard people say it, it's becoming harder and harder to believe.

I've got no reason to feel this way. Nothing I can point at and say ""this is the shit,"" ""this is the shit that causes the shit."" But there's not. This is just the way I am. I've tried so many things. I've tried the meditation, the yoga, the exercise, the good eating, simply showing up to things I said I'd show up to. Even the relationships have been great. I've been with some amazing women. But it always comes back to depression. Always back to this shit. Sometimes situation brings it back, other times it's just the ebb and flow of it. I have felt the ebbs and the flows. I have experienced actual joy, excitement, enjoyment of things, awe. All the things people say make life, I'm happy I did. This hasn't been a joyless life.

Earlier this year, I thought I had it under control. My work schedule was full. I was doing this new work out routine that's designed to help me with my back pain. I was eating well, sleeping well. Doing all those things that had helped me before, and consistently. I've always had this feeling that I'm just running from something that will never stop chasing me. There was one time, before I attempted suicide, where I looked at my couch and felt actual fear. I knew if i sat on it, I wouldn't move for the rest of the day and get lost in my head in a bad way. I went on a run. I thought ""as long as I keep moving, doing something, staying busy, I won't feel that way."" I literally fucking ran from my own depression. It's kind of sad and cliche, but fuck it. This quarantine helped me realize again that all I'm doing is running from something I can't outrun. I went right back into ignoring phone calls, alienating myself. I stopped seeing my therapist, stopped taking my pills. I've called out on work and probably lost clients because of it... sometimes, I start to feel even the slightest bit better and then I start to feel ashamed of that. Ashamed that I felt so damn sad and ashamed for feeling even a little better. Embarrassed. Weak.

I've known for years that my life wouldn't eventually end by my own hands. I think to myself it's better to do it sooner rather than later. The longer I wait, the messier it'll all get. Now, it'd be clean as possible. I live by myself. I just moved and mostly everything is still packed.

I am not asking for help. I am not asking for advice. I just wanted to tell someone, somewhere what's been going through my head. Sorry for the essay.

,depression,"A couple of months ago it was really bad. I genuinely wanted to die. I know people say they don't want to die, they want to be dead or they just want to escape the pain, but i genuinely wanted to die. I was gonna do it one day because I was just so done, but I was so physically and mentally tired and wasn't ready because I just wanted to sleep. I went home and the next day we went into quarantine. I know quarantine has been bad for most people but it stopped me from doing it the next day or day after. Not sure if that was a good thing.

In quarantine things got a bit better, only a little but I didn't want to die anymore, just escape the pain. That's lasted for about two months and I can once again feel that I want to die again. Genuinely. I don't care anymore. I'm trying to do well on my tests and grades to not disappoint everyone all over again but it all feels so overwhelming. When I go to school, the entire day I hide my face because I know how gross and ugly I look. I don't want to repulse people or see their dirty looks. This has been going on for about 4-5 years and I feel so incredibly mentally drained all the time.

There was a period last year where things improved significantly and I thought I was better for a while. I have now concluded that it didn't really leave, just lessened. My mind feels dull and grey, numb. My emotions feel almost far away? Like the huge wall of numbness is blocking me from them. I still feel happiness sometimes? But it feels more like a repressed temporary amusement. I don't actually like the feeling. It feels wrong.

I am 13 years old and almost 14. Can't wait to hear about how I'm just a dramatic and edgy teen. I've honestly doubted myself because other's situations have been much worse than mine so I don't feel like I have a right to feel this way. Sometimes I feel like I'm faking all this which makes me loath myself even more. I can't begin to describe the hatred I have for myself. I am/was going through a very unique family court situation. The final decision has been made of who I stay with. Finally. After NINE years. I hate court. My whole life has literally revolved around it.

I can't remember what it feels like without this numbness. I literally can't remember, I'm not exaggerating. In primary school I thought there was something wrong with me because I never felt happy. Never. I can't imagine how people can be so energetic and excited when it all just looks so boring and exhausting. The only way I can describe what the world is like and what I feel is just this: Tired, so so tired. I'm so tired. I feel like I'm so old. Like I've experienced enough exhaustion for a life time that can't be regenerated, now it's time to go. It's just getting worse, i feel like I genuinely want to die again. and it only ever gets worse.

I don't know why I wrote any of this. This is not a call for help. Maybe I'm just putting my thought down. I feel like because I really just don't care, I just want to see what happens, what peoples responses will be. I have so many more thoughts and this barely even grazes the surface.

I (27F) recently ended things with my boyfriend of 3 years, while we’ve remained in some contact via text. we haven’t seen each other in over a month and probably won’t ever again. mostly due to me, i guess. we’ve talked about trying to work it out but i think i’m going to drive him further away because i truly feel as if i’m becoming unhinged. 

After we broke up, I ended up moving back into my parents house. which has been okay. we’ve never had the best relationship, but I thought this time with me coming back it would be different. it was different. we were getting along, having dinner together every night. it was actually nice. i thought finally i could have THAT relationship, something close to it. my parent’s are older so i feel i probably don’t have that much time with them and i pissed away their good years by being a brat. i really thought things would be good... until today. 

I got a phone call while i was at work basically telling me due to unforeseen circumstance I was going to have to leave. I really don’t want to go into details because that’s another story for another time ... but the gist is someone was have to move in ASAP... and I was going to have to go because there is a very complicated relationship between and that person. my parents chose that person. they told me to figure it out for myself. 

i finished my shift, was a complete wreck the whole time. i cried all day. get home to pack my things and... “figure it out for myself.” 

I drove around a while before finally ending up at a hotel with my dog , Nixon. I guess i’ll be here a few nights... I couldn’t stay with my any of my friends because i have him, but i couldn’t leave him there! I’m nervous about him staying alone in such a strange place but i have to work all weekend. It makes me feel so guilty for ripping him out of two homes where he loved my boyfriend and loved my parents. 

I’ve been laying here alone just sobbing because i seriously don’t know what to do anymore. i’m sure the people next door love me. i feel like i’ve lost everything. Nixon has been laying with me trying to console me. it’s actually so sweet but makes me even more upset because i can’t stop thinking about what i’m going to do if anything happens to him. he’s all i have now.

,depression," 

So I'll spare you guys my life story but about 2yr ago i had gotten into a relationship with a girl i had dumped about a year before (I was stupid i will admit but, she was a once in a life time) and when i had dumped her i was too dumb to realize that i had hurt her especially since we were so young and it had hurt her mentally and soon enough after we had gone through a very weird year of school when she decided she wanted me again, of course i wanted another go at it because we had great chemistry. and so we tried again, after about a month of awkwardness we warmed back up to each other again and we had changed a lot from the last time we had seen each other but had the same vibe and she was still who she was. But about 7 months into the relationship i had seen cuts on her arms… and.. i still feel broken, too this day seeing the face of terror as i caught a glimpse of it but i'm stronger than i look so i had walked her home and stayed with her a bit and i thought i made her feel better but i could never know. Skip forward to know and she has been clinically diagnosed with anxiety (i am too) and depression for her i don't really feel like i can ever really help her when she's sad because I've never experienced what she is going through, and yet when i call her to say good night and she’ll just tell me to be there for her when she is down and out, then gets mad at me when i don't have anything to say or i can't make her feel better and when i try to do something like get her spirits up or tell her that she is more that she makes herself out to be (which i feel like i've done that athousand times) and she just drags herself down i try to tell all the positive things i can and try to take her mind off of everything and she just doesn't seem to change, i tell her to keep fighting and she tells me she is, but i don't see it but her tears make me believe her and i want everything thats good for her and nothing else and when she calls me balling at 3am im fine with that, but when i put my soul in to what i say and what i feel, she just says that i don’t know how she feel, BUT WHEN “I” ASK WHAT SHE MEANS SHE JUST FUCKING SAYS IT AGAIN. I'm not one to get angry and especially at her but i keep this from her to spare her sorrow days and the time she is going through but it’s getting worse since she had to go on a very far trip and she can’t let go of her stress with me in person so she keeps getting worse, 

every time i call her it ends on her crying or her mad at me for some reason and 50% of the time i don’t even know why, it may be because i'm a smooth brain but i just want help with taking care of a person like her i feel like i'm going insane every time i stand there idle as she is literally dying inside everyday of her life. I may be stupid for this but i don’t know anymore but when i say to her that “you have the power to change herself you just have to put you all into it” she says that i don’t get her and that she doesn’t choose to be this way but i don’t think shes faking i just think shes not ketting go of this side of her and just lets it consume her but i don’t want to say try harder because i’ve said that before and… she tried to kill herself and at that point i thought i should leave her to lift the burden but shes told me that if im gone then she would try to kill herself again i just don’t know what to do anymore help

(im one to have strong will so don’t worry about my health i’ll probably forget about it in a few days but i feel like i’m worlds apart form what i love most, i plan on marrying her and you guys may think it’s stupid but it’s what i strive for so please help me so i can make that come true, and if there is some one out there like her please help me because i genuinely do not understand how she feels)",t2_17iu5w,False,,0,False,Sorry if this isn't what i should be posting but i need help,[],r/depression,False,0,,0,,False,t3_h81obl,False,dark,0.67,,public,1,0,{},,False,[],,False,False,,{},,False,1,,False,,False,,[],{},,True,,1592056377.0,text,0,,,text,self.depression,False,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;So I&amp;#39;ll spare you guys my life story but about 2yr ago i had gotten into a relationship with a girl i had dumped about a year before (I was stupid i will admit but, she was a once in a life time) and when i had dumped her i was too dumb to realize that i had hurt her especially since we were so young and it had hurt her mentally and soon enough after we had gone through a very weird year of school when she decided she wanted me again, of course i wanted another go at it because we had great chemistry. and so we tried again, after about a month of awkwardness we warmed back up to each other again and we had changed a lot from the last time we had seen each other but had the same vibe and she was still who she was.

,depression,"Before this pandemic happened, I had everything going for me. I had a decent job, I had a good group of friends, was going to attend a graduation party for my niece and was even looking forward to going on a dream vacation to Connecticut this year. I have autism and felt as though I was progressing the furthest I ever had at any other point in my life. 

The virus ruined all of that. Now I’m out of work and can’t find another job (I’ve been looking for remote work for 4 months now), I’m not going on vacation, I’ve been losing friends and am severely depressed. I also feel like I’ve regressed as far as my autism is concerned and lost all of the gains I made before this happened. 

My depression has also been pretty severe because I regret my past. I wish I had done more in the past knowing what is happening here right now. Instead of staying home, I should have gone out more and explored the world better but instead I foolishly stayed cooped up in the house after work most days during the summer, and since I couldn’t drive and my mom was going places with her boyfriend at the time, and was working, I had practically no opportunity to go anywhere. I had one friend at the time who is still my friend today. We barely went out and didn’t do anything, and I remember being rejected badly by a coworker I had a major crush on at my previous job. I also struggled immensely with making friends at that time, from coworkers to people at college. I messed up my social life so badly back then. 

It took me three years to find the job I was taken out of due to COVID 19, and now I worry due to a poor economy it may take years, even a decade to find another job. I’ve been home sleeping most days as I don’t want to even get out of bed and deal with this situation. I have a therapist but he isn’t of much help. 

I wish I had grown up in the past. I feel like if I had been in my 20s two decades ago, I may have had a better life than the one I’m leading today. I would have at least had an opportunity to make something of myself before this happened. 

I also don’t see an end to this so I feel like my life is over before it even began. All the more reason why I wish I hadn’t just sat home everyday after high school or early college and had actually done something productive with my life. I wish I had gone to CT or another decent vacation in the early 2010s but I was so unproductive and my mom was so busy with other projects that we couldn’t spend time together.

,depression,"I've gone through a ton in my life, not enough for a single post. From these horrid experiences, I've been jaded for most of my life but was still passionate about things and had hope for the future.

Recently, I had to put down my loving cat, and that has devastated me more than I could've imagined. I graduated with a BA in History though it took me almost 7 years to get it because of my mental health issues, and other issues with Asperger's. I'm at a job that is unrewarding, uninspiring, and I'm severely underpaid for someone with a similar level education and experience. When I look at my peers, they're all doing so much better than me.

,depression,"I am a 32 year old woman, relatively successful in my career, still reeling from a breakup 9 months ago with the person I thought I'd be with into old age, the person I thought I'd have children with. He left me for his career and now, in spite of 5 years of love and happiness, pretends I don't exist. To go from feeling so intensely connected to someone, so deeply in love until the final day of our relationship to nothing still traumatises me. I wake in the middle of the night, heart aching, mind racing as it plays through memories of him.  


Earlier this year I had to receive surgery to remove a large tumour from my uterus, and a lot of endometriosis was found. My dream to have children may never be realised as a result, and in spite of the surgery I still have pain every month that debilitates me, leaving me in bed on intense pain medication.

I planned to travel overseas to start my life again. I sold everything I own to setup this new life. I wanted to run from my bad memories, the places that reminded me of my past relationship (everything does), I wanted to reinvent myself. Then Covid happened and I can't go anywhere. I am homeless, sleeping in a single bed, living out of a suitcase at my parents place.

It's been over a year since I last sought out mental help and I honestly feel like I'm enabling myself to get worse. I went off my meds (Zoloft, Seroquel) in February with a plan to try out something new but I stopped pursuing that due to the pandemic-I didn't want to take resources away from people who needed them more than I did.

My brain feels empty and so so numb, when I don't feel numb I'm overwhelmed with the deepest feeling of sadness and isolation and all I can do is cry. This isn't anything new as I've always dealt with severe depression but I always felt like I was on the path of getting better, whereas now I'm at a complete standstill. When I think about this it feels like I'm being crushed and I just want to die.

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s been over a year since I last sought out mental help and I honestly feel like I&amp;#39;m enabling myself to get worse. I went off my meds (Zoloft, Seroquel) in February with a plan to try out something new but I stopped pursuing that due to the pandemic-I didn&amp;#39;t want to take resources away from people who needed them more than I did.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My brain feels empty and so so numb, when I don&amp;#39;t feel numb I&amp;#39;m overwhelmed with the deepest feeling of sadness and isolation and all I can do is cry. This isn&amp;#39;t anything new as I&amp;#39;ve always dealt with severe depression but I always felt like I was on the path of getting better, whereas now I&amp;#39;m at a complete standstill. When I think about this it feels like I&amp;#39;m being crushed and I just want to die.&lt;/p&gt;

,depression,"My university friend group is tightly-knit, and we have very little drama. Everyone’s easy-going. We just drink and play video games and make jokes. There’s one relationship in the group: L and my best friend.

I have individual friendships with a lot of them, but my friendship with L was awkward. I had liked him at one point, before he got together with my best friend, and both of them knew about it.

Our last few nights together, everyone was sad to be leaving, and I got to talking to L about his depression. I’d known that he felt sad for a little while, but I didn’t feel like it was my place to say anything about it.

Here’s the thing: I’m high-functioning. I act very happy-go-lucky. I seem like I have my life together. I doubt many people suspect how I feel, and if they do, they don’t understand how deep it goes. And that included L.

That night, he was the first person I’ve ever told that I had seriously considered suicide at multiple points in my life, as a reciprocation for what he told me. He cried when I told him that people care about him. We hugged.

I left feeling like we’d bonded, platonically. I thought we understood each other better. I checked in on him a couple of points since them. Short texts to make sure he was fine.

I’ve always been careful about not overstepping because I care about my best friend, and I don’t want to intrude on their relationship.

But I found out that whenever L’s been angry at my best friend since then, he’s used our friendship to try to make her jealous. He tells her that I text him, without giving her the context. He tells her that we’re “close,” that I “get him” more than her.

I couldn’t even begin to unravel the situation without telling my best friend about my depression. About how bad of a place I was at two years ago. I had to, since he’d betrayed both her and my trust so severely.

I’m so angry about it still. All the nights that I cried myself to sleep. The time I nearly passed out from trying to cut. The plans I’d made to die when I was 18. The times that I ended up in the wrong place because of public transit and wondered if I could just get even more lost. The fact that I’m sort of scared of fast trains because the urge to jump in front is so strong sometimes.

He used it all. Just to make his girlfriend jealous. I hadn’t told ANYONE about some of that stuff before. I thought he genuinely got it.

My best friend’s forgiven him because she’s the kindest soul I’ve ever met, and my other friends don’t want the drama, so I can’t be mad about it. I’m pretending that I’m not. No one’s noticed. I don’t think he even has. I just feel so angry. So betrayed.

And I feel lonelier than ever. My best friend trusts me, since I had to out my mental illness to her, but it was a near thing. She actually said she was glad he opened up to me, since she wants him to talk to someone. My friends who know about the situation don’t want to hear me rage, since it’s resolved in their eyes. Everyone just wants my high-functioning persona, the one that doesn’t rock the boat. I guess I’m just venting here, since I can’t anywhere else.

I feel like God just spins a wheel and that dictates your entire life. You could cast into a rich family but with shitty parents, a poor family but with the nicest parents the world could offer, a middle class family that gets divorced, fuck it you could even be fucking abandoned by your parents and sent to an orphanage.

You don't get a say in where you're going. Your just going there no fucking questions asked. I got cast into a middle class family with a nice dad and shitty narcissist mother who has shames me for every little fucking thing I do wrong. She makes fun of me and even beats me but acts like a good mom outside. She even had the audacity to call herself a mini god. I feel like a failure since I suck ass at everything.

You could cast into a rich family but with shitty parents, a poor family but with the nicest parents the world could offer, a middle class family that gets divorced, fuck it you could even be fucking abandoned by your parents and sent to an orphanage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You don&amp;#39;t get a say in where you&amp;#39;re going. Your just going there no fucking questions asked. I got cast into a middle class family with a nice dad and shitty narcissist mother who has shames me for every little fucking thing I do wrong. She makes fun of me and even beats me but acts like a good mom outside. She even had the audacity to call herself a mini god. I feel like a failure since I suck ass at everything. I feel really depressed and I want to kill myself but I don&amp;#39;t even have the balls to cut myself. I try to get the suicidal thoughts out by saying &amp;quot;hey there&amp;#39;s lots that are coming up in the future (like Jojo part 6 animated and MHA season 5) if you kill yourself you won&amp;#39;t experience them. I fantasize about a world where I killed myself or a world where I&amp;#39;m good at things and I&amp;#39;m a success.

I see two people I thought were friends, one typically on my commute and one at my work. 

Friend one: 

So one of my friends asks how I am and I just say ""good"" even when I'm not, but she isn't there like I am for her. She talks me up and says we're close but I have have said my peace to her and listen for her without interruption. Is it bad to feel like she thinks of me as one of her closest friends when I don't feel the same? When I feel bad I'd just want to be heard, not given advice on 'what I should do' despite how I don't want the options they give me to support me, I just want to be heard. Part of me feels bad in this regard, as I have stated I can't be as open to trust things with her as she does to me, so it's almost exclusively me listening to her and never the other way around since when I tell her things (and we've discussed it to the point I flat out said I wouldn't tell her any more things on my mind), she ends up not thinking and sharing them to others when I'd like it to be between us (anxiety about the future, money woes, etc.) I suppose I do view us as friends but I get or almost feel like I want people who tell me or assume we are best friends when I don't view her the same as bad thing. 

""friend two"": This ""friend"" doesn't really have to interact with me but she does anyway, and I dunno if it's for show. I'd like to tell her off but telling her not to act like she cares seems like a better alternative than the profanities I'd rather utter. She's kinda ignores my messages and all and at work puts on a happy face regardless of her own feelings which is nice and all if you want to be left alone/not questioned, which I get but I don't bother putting up a facade. We've had some good talks in the past but part of me thinks that's all they were and I don't really dig the attempts to talk to me anymore as I'm some sort of 'charity case.' I probably view this in a more negative light than I should but I suppose me sharing when they said ""they can handle it"" and seems to be slowly distancing themselves from me except when they feel bad &amp; see me in person.

Like, if I’m sad, really sad, it’s like whenever I’m with another person I just instantly put a mask on and then I’m happy again and can joke and laugh. Even if I’m in a bad mood and I tell the other person that I’m actually in a really bad mood the second I’m with them it’s like I put a thick mask on. There’s nothing wrong about being happy, but the problem is that I’m not. Sometimes I’m really sad and I should allow myself to be sad. Not that I should be sad all the time but putting on a fake mask isn’t the best either. 1. Because when I get home to myself I relax and I feel so fake because I can relax again and take off the fake mask and all the sad feeling just boils over and I feel like such a fake person! And 2. Because it’s really hard for my friends and others to understand and take me serious when I tell them I’m sick and don’t feel good because they can’t see it. Which has caused huge issues for me and I’ve lost friends because they couldn’t understand that I was sick when I was “happy” when I was with them.
And I’ve spent a long time in therapy trying to work on taking in the mask but it’s hard.
I just get so “mad” and frustrated when I’m actually trying to open up and be sad and show my emotions and people just say “don’t be sad” or try to make a joke or make me laugh. I know they don’t mean anything bad with it, but it’s no wonder I don’t know how to show my emotions and how I actually fell when people try to make me laugh every time I’m sad. Sometimes you should be allowed to be sad. Again, I’m not talking about all the time and being super depressed, but sometimes all you need is a “that sucks” and to feel validated that it’s okay to bed sad! Not a “don’t be sad” or “you’ll get through it” because that’s really not validating to the fact that you are sad at the moment. Of course I’ll get through it, but don’t ever come to me and tell me you don’t understand why I’m sick and that I don’t share my emotions then, when whenever I try I get shut down with a “don’t be sad” comment. 

I’m sorry that this has become more of a rant than anything.

,depression," 

Some   background: 

At age 15, I fell in love with a girl at first sight. Her name was let's say Julie. I first saw her sitting on a couch at our   high school orientation for an odd new type of school. I was hesitant to   go to this school, I saw her and I thought I want to be with her. She   was seeing someone else, we became best friends. 5 months later she   broke up with her boyfriend for me, we were inseparable for the next 3   years or so. Something she would always say to me that bother the shit   out of me was ""don't love me too much I am going to die before I turn   20."" I loved her more than I should have and she loved me, our families   got along great, she came on a trip to Paris with my family which was   one of her life goals. During my junior year/her senior year we were   great, she was talking about college. We both knew long distance would   be very difficult. She was graduating high school and I was starting my   senior year, she had plans to go to college.

She   broke up with me before my senior year started so that we didn't have   the pain of long distance. It broke me. I would lay on a daybed in the   office of the apt I was living in alone (longer story than I care to   share) It felt like I had a hole shot through my chest removing my   heart. Not being over dramatic, I felt paralyzed, sick, lost, hurt   beyond all words, mostly just dead inside.

My   senior year started whether I was ready or not, people gave me pity and   talked about her to me constantly, we had a group of mutual friends  and I  found out she was not going to college that year and it hurt all  over  again. She was partying and dating around. About 4 months later I  was  asked on a date by one of our mutual friends  named Kathy, who was  kind  of in competition with my ex, she was very attractive and I liked  her a  lot. We had one date and had sex. Kathy asked me to go to an  event with  her that I knew Julie would be at. I felt like I was being  shown off to  make Julie annoyed or jealous. So I did not continue the  relationship  with Kathy. I decided no more dating, I hung out with  friends and tried  to move on, halfway through my senior year Julie  began mentoring a  junior at our highschool and was around 2 days a  week. She would try to  talk to me or start conversations and I being  petty and hurt would  refuse or pretend to be too busy to talk. She knew  I slept with our  mutual friend Kathy I assume, she was slightly more  cold and closed off  than I remember her. My chest would hurt. I wasn't  ready for her to be  back in my life in any way let alone as an  acquaintance or friend.

Another   mutual friend of Julie and mine asked me if I wanted to get back   together with her and I said ""no, she could die for all I care."" I did   not mean this in any way I still loved her and would have waited for her   forever. 3 months later she died. She died at a college party of an   accidental drug overdose right before he 19th birthday.

Right   before I graduated highschool. While I was living alone, I was dead   inside all over again after starting to pick up the pieces of our break   up. I had nothing left. I do not remember feeling a single emotion, I   did not cry I didn't feel sad. I felt NOTHING. Not like down or   depressed. I felt nothing. Nothing. I would wake up drive myself to   school, take my classes. Go home and play videogames sometimes until it   was time to go to school again. I closed off from friends other than 1   or 2 who are still my best friends today. They would just sit a play   games with me. We didn't talk about anything related to Julie's death.   The funeral service was announced and my mother went with me. I saw   pictures of me and her together I saw her extended family who all knew   me. Then I saw her mother, and the wail of grief that came out of her   saying my name, shattered my nothingness. And I felt everything. Pain so   unbearable I broke down for hours, sputtering though the service   holding her mother, seeing her brother and her father all of our   friends, the pictures. My mother had to leave. She left me with one of   Julie and my mutual friends we'll call her Kayla. She drove me home. She   sat with me for the entire night I think, I cannot really remember.  She  held me and talked to me and was great. I decided I was going to  drop  out of highschool, I did not give a flying fuck about anything. My  good  friend said he would help me finish school, he would do every  assignment  for me he would pick me up and drop me off, all I had to do  was get in  the car. My friend saying that was all I needed. I  graduated, I did as  much as I could muster everyday, I drank, smoked  weed, took pills, and  used drugs to cope. Tried to feel as little as  possible.

This  past week: I heard  a song on YouTube the singer looked and sounded like  Julie, and sang like Julie, singing a  song about a missed love, and everything came rushing  back at me like  it was happening again, I am engaged, I have a great  business, I am depressed about the country right now, but I have been  very fortunate  to keep my work. What kind of specialist can help me, I  am afraid my  new counselor may not be enough, I had one session and  could not get  into what was bothering me yet, I am unsure about  everything. My  anxiety is through the roof, if I cannot get my  depression under  control I am going to miss important work deadlines.

All   I can think about is that, I believe the last words I said to Julie   were ""you don't have to talk to me every time you see me."" And I had   said ""she could die for all I cared"" those two sentences have haunted me   for almost 15 years. I know I cannot un-hear them or unsay them.

For   almost 15 years I have had sadness and depression about Julie, but  this  past week it has disabled me, what do I do. It is affecting my   engagement, my fiancee, and my work. Nobody knows that those are the   last memories I have with and about her. I have kept them to myself and   it is eating me alive now. I cannot bear to tell my family or friends  or  anyone.

,depression,"Hi, guys. I’m from an economically declining country, but my family has never had any financial difficulties thanks to my dad and his job in law enforcement. He’s a loving father, not abusive or evil at all, but I can’t help but think how our country’s political system is so rotten that it’s impossible to work in his field without being corrupt, and our finances indicate that he’s earning more than his official salary. I don’t think he’s involved in anything more controversial than bribery, for which our country’s police is commonly known.

I feel increasingly uncomfortable with the fact that my dad is paying for my expenses. I’m 23 years old, and the idea of emancipation is the most enticing thing. But I chose to study in the arts, which coupled with our country’s declining economy, leaves me with either the necessity of him supporting me financially while I can get to stand for myself practicing what I like, or giving up on my professional career and working a miserable job indefinitely. I also have to say that thinking about his job paying for my expenses gives me a massive amount of stress that messes with my ability to focus on creative endeavors.

I’ve been thinking about this for the past 5 years, and the current media bombardment of hate against law enforcement is making feel dizzy every time I look at his picture on the wall and see him pridefully wearing his uniform. My friends from art school are increasingly involved in protests against police and the ACAB movement, and most of them know I’m the son of a police officer, which makes me feel judged every time the social justice topic comes up (although they never directly criticize me for my dad). I also have more material possessions than them, since, as I already stated, my country’s economy is in shambles. I feel bad for wanting to play videogames in an expensive console (can’t feel the hype for the ps5), or driving the car my dad bought in my name to school (taking the bus makes me feel better, even if it takes me half an hour longer).

I feel like I’m a coward for not just cutting any financial ties with my dad and dropping out of school to work as a waiter or something, yet I sometimes think that would be dumb since I’d be losing the opportunity of taking advantage of my financial position and trying to build something good and worthwhile (which I think is my dad’s plan, since he himself complains about our government and believes he’s just following orders from people he hopes sometime will change for the better). But I feel like that second part is just my cowardice speaking, my fear of facing the hardships of life for myself, since thanks to my dad I’ve never had to work out of necessity. 

I don’t think that I could ever end my own life, the thought seems impossible, but the fact that I’m thinking about it worries me.

,depression,"I have been having a really though time lately and I don’t know if that’s going to lead me into another depressive episode. I don’t have anyone to really talk about that to, I feel like I’m a burden to my best friend. We haven’t been talking much lately but she has been a lifeline for me in the past. I generally only have very Surface Level friendships and being able talk to someone about the darkest things in my life has been helping me not to completely lose my grip of reality. I feel like I’m spiraling, I don’t have any hope in the future, I just try to make it through the day without losing it. I feel like I’m stuck in the small prison cell that is my mind.

,depression,"I’ve been feeling a growing depression overtaking me for years now. A dark despair that ebbs. I don’t have anyone to talk to about it because I’m so ashamed about being emotionally/mentally weak. I can’t let anyone know my insecurities because I fear they’ll know how pathetic I truly am. 

1. I am so damn lonely. I have “friends and family” and I call and text them...but they never call me, check in on me. When we see each other in person they seem disinterested in what I have to share or say.  I’ve realized that maybe we aren’t as close as I thought we were.  I feel like I don’t matter at all.

2. I feel like a failure. I’m a high school drop out, I’ve been fired from almost every job I’ve had, and went to online college. I try my hardest at my job but I feel like sometimes I just don’t get it. It’s so complicated and I make so many errors despite my best efforts. I fear I will never be able to be a person who has their “shit together” and excels in life.

3. I have no idea what my life’s purpose is. I see so many people online and irl that have this drive and passion, and I try my hardest to explore mine...to no avail. What is my life’s purpose? To pay taxes to make sure the roads are paved? I feel unfulfilled and misguided.

4. I hate my appearance.  I’m 30 years old now and time is starting to show. Extra fat everywhere, wrinkles, fallen face, saggy cellulite body. I try to diet and exercise, but I have no self control. I can do it for a few days and then resort back to over eating and laziness.  Since the pandemic hit I’ve started a diet/exercise routine probably 5x different times.

5.  I can’t overcome my addictions.  Cigarettes, alcohol, sugar and overeating. I’ve tried quitting probably 3x in the past 3 months. I can do it for about a week and then fall off the wagon. I feel so little happiness from my life that my vices are the only thing that gives me pleasure. 

6. Anxiety. I feel so overwhelmed with worry, fear, self consciousness, or being out of control that sometimes I shake, sweat, get dizzy spells, can’t breathe, get heart palpitations, and tunnel vision. It’s has caused problems at work, because I have to stop whatever it is I’m doing and go for walk or get fresh air. My bosses ask what’s wrong with me, but I’m too shamed to tell the truth.

7. I have no skills. I try to learn to paint, play drums, draw, sew, garden...but I just can’t develop the ability necessary to excel at these skills. I am very envious of talented people and wish I were one of them. I follow them closely online and practically idolize them.

,depression,"I used to be a sensitive and anxious child, I cried a lot and was able to empathize with people easily. I could never connect to people though, and I had no friends. I wasn’t exactly bullied but there were older kids who used to mock me for my height and weight. When I reached my adolescence I just... broke and I haven’t been the same since. 

Over the years, I started feeling less emotions and it became harder for me to empathize with others. I recently turned 18 and I barely feel emotions anymore, and when I do they only last for a couple of minutes — additionally, I only seem to feel anger, annoyance and sadness, but they don’t last long. I’m often just... I don’t even know how to describe it... Empty? Numb? Nothing? I don’t know. I just don’t feel anything. 

My traumas don’t hurt me anymore, I think about them, poke the wound, and I don’t feel anything. Years ago, I cried myself to sleep almost every night and could barely think for a second about my traumas. Nowadays they don’t bother me anymore, they’re not unpleasant, they just are. 

My empathy has also decreased considerably. I don’t care anymore. It used to be easy for me to /know/ and relate to what other people feel, but not anymore. I find it difficult to read people now, and I just don’t care about what happens to others. I don’t feel guilt or remorse anymore - I lied to my parents about having passed all my classes this semester when in reality I only passed one class, I could had never done something like that in the past but now? The lie slipped easily and I don’t feel guilty about it. 

I haven’t experienced happiness in months, and even then I only experienced it for a short while. 

I go about my life faking smiles and love for my family. I don’t care about them.

I could never connect to people though, and I had no friends. I wasn’t exactly bullied but there were older kids who used to mock me for my height and weight. When I reached my adolescence I just... broke and I haven’t been the same since. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over the years, I started feeling less emotions and it became harder for me to empathize with others. I recently turned 18 and I barely feel emotions anymore, and when I do they only last for a couple of minutes — additionally, I only seem to feel anger, annoyance and sadness, but they don’t last long. I’m often just... I don’t even know how to describe it... Empty? Numb? Nothing? I don’t know. I just don’t feel anything. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My traumas don’t hurt me anymore, I think about them, poke the wound, and I don’t feel anything. Years ago, I cried myself to sleep almost every night and could barely think for a second about my traumas. Nowadays they don’t bother me anymore, they’re not unpleasant, they just are. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My empathy has also decreased considerably. I don’t care anymore. It used to be easy for me to /know/ and relate to what other people feel, but not anymore. I find it difficult to read people now, and I just don’t care about what happens to others. I don’t feel guilt or remorse anymore - I lied to my parents about having passed all my classes this semester when in reality I only passed one class, I could had never done something like that in the past but now? The lie slipped easily and I don’t feel guilty about it. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I haven’t experienced happiness in months, and even then I only experienced it for a short while. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I go about my life faking smiles and love for my family. I don’t care about them.

,depression,"To whoever reads this, thank you and hello. I had a look through the sub rules, but apologies if I get anything wrong with this post.

I'm struggling and I need to vent. I'm (m30) and I'm in a complete slump following a breakup with my then girlfriend back in February. For this post, I'll call her S

I'd been with S for nearly two years and it had been the best time of my life. I was coming off two successive relationships that had been a disaster and left my self esteem at near rock bottom. After a while of being alone, S joined my team at work and soon after made it clear that she was interested. We struck up a relationship soon after and it was like a breath of fresh air. She really helped me regain my confidence and helped me experience lots of new things. I was truly in love and for a long time, she was eager to spend any possible moment with me.

In the last 6 months of the relationship, we began to argue with some regularity about work given our contrasting attitudes towards work matters. I know.... work relationships are a bad idea, especially when you sit next to each other in the office, but I guess you can't help who you fall for. It would be incredibly rare that we would argue about personal life, but neither of us left our jobs, so the arguments continued.

We went on a work trip over Christmas and stayed in the area an extra night to have some time together and we had a great time with one exception. During that extra day, she felt bad and after spending a long time in the bathroom, she showed me a giant congealed blob of blood. Unfortunately, I would learn a few weeks later that S miscarried while we were on the trip. The memory of seeing it in her hand still haunts me.
The miscarriage knocked me for six as I've wanted a family for a long time. Even before we were together, S had never expressed too much desire for parenthood due to health complications that would make carrying to term extremely difficult. However, that seemed to change at some point, as I fondly remember the conversation we had regarding it where she said being with me had changed her mind and that she hoped it might happen with me one day.
I hid my anguish about the miscarriage from her, as I wanted to be the strong, supportive one, but I felt like a zombie for a while and she outwardly brushed it off as 'one of those things'

We broke up in February after an argument about how she felt like I didn't think she was good enough at her job. I tried to reassure her that I did, stating 'of course I think you're good enough' but this caused her to take that comment literally as though I was suggesting she was ONLY good enough. Clearly the frequent arguments proved too much and she ended the relationship. 

I steered clear for a couple of weeks to let things cool down. Soon after I returned to work, we went for a drink to talk things over. It seemed to go well and we did various things like compatibility tests to try to figure out what the other looked for in a relationship. A few more work arguments occurred although we would continue to do things together outside of work to make an effort. Around 6ish weeks ago, her attitude completely changed and she was no longer interested in trying to talk things over, despite having done so just a day prior.

Tonight, I've found a post from her on reddit expressing happiness that the UK can now form social bubbles as this would allow her to finally have some intimacy with her 'other half'. I confronted her, as she had started spending a lot of time during lockdown with 'a friend' around the time she stopped trying to talk things over with me. She said she made up the 'other half' comment 'for internet points' (which I don't believe) but that she was interested in the guy.

I cry about losing her and the miscarriage almost every single day and have frequent nightmares about it. I don't have a big social circle to rely on for support and my aspergers (albeit I'm extremely high functioning) makes it incredibly difficult to make friends. Those friends I do have haven't proved to be very supportive. I poured my heart out to a friend last month, telling him the entire story and he never got back to me.

I've tried to build new interests to find something to overcome the dark thoughts but my mind is constantly on her. I feel like I have nothing to live for as I view my prospects for happiness as extremely low and I honestly wish I could do something about it. The only thing that has stopped me is knowing that it would destroy my family if I did do something drastic. As a result, I wake up dreading what the day is going to bring and feeling incredibly isolated.

In an alternate universe, this summer I would have been in a new house, with S and our child. Instead, I cant move (because of covid and other factors costing me a promotion I'd previously had a secondment to) and I'm on my own having lost the latter two.

I feel like I'm at rock bottom. Any advice on combating the dark thoughts would really be appreciated. Apologies this was such a long post!

I never feel fully awake, I always feel as if I&amp;#39;m in someone&amp;#39;s way, I always let people walk all over me, I feel like my creativity is garbage, etc etc. I know it sounds like typical shit but I really don&amp;#39;t know how to kick the feelings. I&amp;#39;ve even been exercising, gotten sober, have a wonderful girlfriend, and yet I still never feel good about myself at all. And just the sheer amount of times the word &amp;quot;I&amp;quot; has been used in this post makes me sick.

One of the issue with depression that I've seen mentioned with depression is a lack of energy.  I'll walk at a decent speed on the treadmill and it occasionally will help a bit.  While I'm walking I'm always thinking about how I should be going harder but even that doesn't make much difference.  
I have rarely ever had issues with energy (I got to bed around the same time every night).  I just sit around letting my mind drive me crazy with negative thoughts and feelings.

I was diagnosed with ADHD as a kid but I don't see much of that while depressed (I'm guessing that the depression could mask that aspect?).

&lt;p&gt;And not only that, part of the perfectionist me dislikes other people who talk too much about themselves, but the whole point of an attention whore is to talk about yourself, so whenever I talk about myself I view myself as having the traits I don&amp;#39;t like while at the same time feeling the need to express those traits or it feels like I&amp;#39;m nothing but a bystander.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I can&amp;#39;t rant to anyone without feeling like shit because I realize &amp;quot;why the fuck would they care&amp;quot; while at the same time I pray to God that they really do care because I haven&amp;#39;t had any sort of attention in almost forever. Sure I post and get upvotes, but the upvoters aren&amp;#39;t upvoting because of &lt;em&gt;me&lt;/em&gt; it&amp;#39;s because of my &lt;em&gt;content&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#39;t know if any of that made any sense, and it&amp;#39;s fine if you downvote I get it, I would too. But I just wanted to get this message out somewhere.&lt;/p&gt;

My depression makes it very difficult to get through work weeks. It seems like after a year at a job I'm completely over it. It drains me. Mentally and physically. I don't really like getting close to co-workers for some reason either. I am more introverted. I'm now back in college to get out of the field I'm in (while also wondering if any field will make me happy). I go home and do school work after work. I also eat like shit because of lack of time and energy. While it is positive that I even signed back up for classes, it also makes my anxiety go ballistic when I think about working full time to keep up with bills, keeping up with school, and trying to keep my head above water, both mentally and physically (self care). I also have to upkeep the home I rent and do other normal life tasks, etc. (Exhausting in it's own right). The state of the world is also killing my spirit. It's sad but I'm basically hoping for the rapture. I take welbutrin. Seems to help somewhat with the depression. Idk. It's the only one I've tried. I am engaged, and feel like if I can't find out how to be happy, I will lose her. Again, more anxiety. It's difficult to find joy in anything. I've thought about suicide for over a decade but came to the realization I couldn't put that pain on my loved ones, so I grin and bear it for them. I also have low self esteem. I drink about everyday. Sometimes 1 beer, sometimes 8 and a shot. I use cannabis to unwind and fall asleep since my brain never stops going. I'm not even sure what I expect to gain from posting this.

Ready to get married, plan for kids.

I lost it all. 

It all started with a bad move at work. Changing teams. This stupid feeling of never being fully satisfied that accompanied through all my life made me do this.  Once I realised what I had done I regretted so badly, as the new reality was so much worse than what I had. From there it was a slow, steady and cruel downhill of an entire year. I couldn't sleep. Then I was dead at work. Started to have issues to relate with new colleagues especially boss. I was missing the old ones so badly. Then I've seen a doctor. Started therapies. Took pills. I've tried three different pills and two different therapists. Had time off. Simply could not recover. And then it was over. After losing the job everything deteriorated. Moved back to home country which is in real bad situation. Relationship is not the same, actually it seems just a matter of time until it is over.

for those of you who've never experienced real happiness. This is for you. Keep searching. I believe one day you'll find it. When you do. The most important thing. Recognise it. Look around you. Be grateful. DON'T BE LIKE ME.

the worst feeling ever... the painful memories of a happy life. It was so great, so perfect, that it makes so hard now... I wish it had never existed. I truly wish i hadn't flown that higher if the end result was this unbearable pain.

the worst feeling ever is when you become just a glimpse of what you once was. And the memories come back to haunt you. Every day, every night. It just gets worse.

,depression,"For the past.. I don't know how many years, I've just found myself getting worse and worse, in terms of motivation, positive thinking, attention span, accomplishments...

I used to write so much. So many short stories and books now I can barely write a page. I can hardly keep my attention on reading a book without my mind trailing off and me finding myself just... on my phone. Mindlessly.

I used to be good in school, straight A's, bright future. I found out yesterday my final for my one and only college class was on Wednesday. I felt so shitty, the lowest of dirt, just... a failure. It kind of knocked me back into reality and I realized ""Holy shit, I've made no real effort towards school or life in general since my junior year of High School what the fuck am I doing with my life?"" I begged the teacher to give me another chance. She let me retake the final and I honestly cried when I read that she had. I don't deserve that. 

I could blame it on Covid, or being laid off because of it, but I think I've finally come to accept there's something seriously wrong with me. I constantly think about what I want to do, how I want to better my life, and I never manage to drag myself to actually do it. I'm sick of it, I'm sick of myself, I'm sick of my inability to do basic functions, even talking to someone on the phone gives me dread. Maybe I have anxiety, maybe it's depressed, maybe I'm even ADHD or Autistic but SOMETHING is wrong in my brain, except... 

Every time I think I'm going to finally look for a therapist or counselor or psychologist I get scared that... maybe I'm just lazy. Maybe if I just manage to DO the things I always think I should be doing it'll be fine. I shouldn't waste a professional's time with it especially when I have such a blessed life with people who love me and others have actual serious issues- but wait, isn't that a SYMPTOM of mental health issues??

Why does my brain shout at me for every single thing I do wrong, encourage me to do all these things I SHOULD be doing to better myself, then immediately when I look up therapists and counselors it says ""well, actually... you're overreacting, you're just lazy."" And then it's just a cycle of believing I have something wrong with me and then telling myself I'm fine because I'm not suicidal and nothing's especially wrong with my life, except for the fact that I'm miserable and horrendously incapable. I need to get out. I need to do SOMETHING productive that actually MEANS something. I need to exercise, get to bed early, cut back on smoking, get serious about school, and stop goddamn crying about shit.

&lt;p&gt;Every time I think I&amp;#39;m going to finally look for a therapist or counselor or psychologist I get scared that... maybe I&amp;#39;m just lazy. Maybe if I just manage to DO the things I always think I should be doing it&amp;#39;ll be fine. I shouldn&amp;#39;t waste a professional&amp;#39;s time with it especially when I have such a blessed life with people who love me and others have actual serious issues- but wait, isn&amp;#39;t that a SYMPTOM of mental health issues??&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Why does my brain shout at me for every single thing I do wrong, encourage me to do all these things I SHOULD be doing to better myself, then immediately when I look up therapists and counselors it says &amp;quot;well, actually... you&amp;#39;re overreacting, you&amp;#39;re just lazy.&amp;quot; And then it&amp;#39;s just a cycle of believing I have something wrong with me and then telling myself I&amp;#39;m fine because I&amp;#39;m not suicidal and nothing&amp;#39;s especially wrong with my life, except for the fact that I&amp;#39;m miserable and horrendously incapable. I need to get out. I need to do SOMETHING productive that actually MEANS something. I need to exercise, get to bed early, cut back on smoking, get serious about school, and stop goddamn crying about shit. I don&amp;#39;t know if I can do it alone or if I&amp;#39;ll need help, if I even could be brave enough to ask for help besides this reddit post... &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Are you in a cycle too? Did you break out? Are you breaking out?&lt;/p&gt;

,depression,"I am 18 years old, turning 19 soon. But I don't feel 18, I don't feel like an adult yet. The way I act is very childish. I have never been able to be independent, ever since I was young, Ive depended on others. I suffer from anxiety, but back then, I only thought I was shy. I would never be able to do anything on my own, and still can't to this day. I've had depression ever since I was in 7th grade, but it's also genetic, since my mum also suffers from it. I have also been diagnosed with high functioning Autism.

When I was a child, I couldn't do anything by myself, I depended on others. For example, I would only do something if my sister would be there too. I wouldn't be able to do anything alone. The person I depended on would always change though, growing up with my sister, it would be my sister that I would want to be around in order to do anything. But then it changed to my friends, I had to be with them all the time, especially during class. Which caused me so much stress because I wouldn't always be in the same class as them. I ended up having so many panic attacks when I was away from them because I couldn't function by myself. In 12th grade, I had 3 friends (including my boyfriend) one of them eventually left the school, this ended up cause a lot of trauma for me. Back when I was in 7th grade, I lost all my friends and was alone most the time. That's when I started getting extremely depressed. That depression has never ended. So when my friend left, my life went to shit again. I had all my classes with her, and only her. My other friend didn't hang out with us anymore because she didn't want to hang out with a couple because that's just awkward for the lot of us. It was just me and my boyfriend. Because of all this trauma I experienced during this time, I clung to him. He was all I had and I didn't want to be alone.

 As of now, my boyfriend is still the person I depend on, I don't go to school anymore. We hang out all the time and when he can't I have extreme panic attacks because I don't know what to do with myself when I'm away from him. I don't do well alone, I get flashbacks of what happened in the past, when I was left alone. I experience suicidal thoughts daily. There isn't a single day that goes by, where I don't hate myself. I don't know what to do, I know this is all wrong and unhealthy, I know that. Its just so hard. I feel like my Adolescent days have messed me up so bad. I feel like I haven't had the time to properly grow up, maybe that's why I feel this way? I really don't know. I just wish I'd never been born at all. I don't know what to do.

,depression,"I've struggled with depression for as long as I can remember. My entire formative years up until this point now. I believe it stems from a lack of community and lack of personal connection I feel with any people at all due to bullying and ostracism in high school for no real reason but that's besides the point. 

I (26F) have always had to pull myself out of holes. It always amazes me when someone says a friend came and forced them out of whatever pain spiral they were in because I know no one is coming for me. It's ingrained in my mind somehow that this depression is a me problem and I shouldn't rely on anyone else to help me or fix me. Logically I know it's not weakness to need help but honestly it doesn't make any difference because no one is coming regardless. 

I feel like every experience in my life has been tainted with the sadness. It's like a thick tar enveloping and seeping through any and all cracks in the moments and corrupting them. Usually I can enjoy things but as of late I feel like I'm drowning in this vast ocean of fucking black tar. 

I've tried everyday my whole life to fix my problems. I am extremely active and intelligent (probably a touch narcissistic) and have never let my depression effect my work, studies or productivity. I would call it high functioning I guess. When I couldn't cope in high school I threw my 4.0 GPA and college acceptances out to the wind and enlisted in the Marine Corps. I thought that change- that structure and community- would make it better. It didn't. I took up skydiving while I was in and have continued it for years and while its a quick adrenalin fix I'm labeled with my pain as soon as I have my parachute picked up from the ground. Because of skydiving I know I don't want to die, plummeting with your head pointed at the ground at 180 mph gives you a choice, and I will always choose to break away and deploy. 

I'm in the middle of I think the worst depression crisis of my life. I've always felt bad but I've never felt this bad. I've never just cried randomly or gotten so overwhelmed I sit on my kitchen floor sobbing for 2 hours. I was used to the every couple of days intrinsic thought of hey just drive off a bridge or something but now these thoughts surround me and suffocate me. I bought a little anchor for my stand up paddleboard and all I could and still think about is tying it to my foot and throwing it overboard. The biggest deterrent to this is that it is likely not heavy enough to keep me down. I exercise a lot and now when I do I just keep crying. I biked 12 miles the other day and cried the whole time. It's been like this for weeks.

I'm at the end of my rope, and when I say this I truly wholeheartedly mean it. I can't cope with anything and for the first time my work has begun to suffer for it. I reached out to the VA for psychiatric care and the earliest they can get me in for a therapist is july 15th and for a psychiatrist is july 30th. Imagine reaching out in the worst crisis of your life and them telling you to wait over a month. I've since reached out to my university and they gave me an appointment for today.

I can't do anything to make myself feel better anymore. I went shopping for new clothes because I lost 30 pounds since august (intentionally) and turned in my larges for smalls. That in it of itself feels really good and for the first time ever I looked in the mirror in the dressing room and really liked what I saw. I hadn't really looked at myself in a long time and I was impressed. This somehow made me feel worse. 

Why is it that everyone has these friends, these communities, people that care and this priviledge is denied to me? What is fundamentally wrong with me that I am not allowed a place in the world other than the grave I've been digging for 13 years?

Edit to add: I'm going to school for biochem because I want to be a psychiatrist, because I love helping people with their mental troubles. I'm all of my friends pocket therapist and I wouldnt have it any other way. 

I try to talk to people about this but they say things like 'you have so much going for you, look at your goals and accomplishments!' Goals and accomplishments dont prevent people from being sad, I am a living breathing example of that.

,depression,"I am a boy with 2 main things in my life, videogames and volleyball. Last winter i was diagnosed with osgood's sclatter ( repetitive strain injury on my knees ). Only problem with this was that i am one of the best U18-players in volleyball in my country and i have got invited to many of my country's international-volleyball-team's training camps.
But because of the strain injury. I coudn't even train in my nearby volleyball team. Because of this, i have sat on my computer for many hours a day playing with my friends, because that is the only thing that keeps me away from my thoughts. And yes, i have went to visit many personal trainers and i have gotten good exercises from them. But i have been too lazy to do them. At first i did them actually a lot, but now i stopped doing them because i didn't feel the exercises we're helping with my knees. Also my motivation to volleyball went down a lot. And everyday my father asks me if i have done the exercises, and i forget to do them always. After he asks that and i answer: ""no, i have forgotten about them."" Insted of getting positive comments like: "" ohh, i hope you don't forget them tomorrow."" He starts saying: "" you are useless, you will never be good at anything."" Or something simular. And everyday i cry myself to sleep thinking that i am not good enough for this world. And everytime i get some motivation from _______ , but i forget to do the exercises, he starts calling me useless and then my motivation levels go down from 5% to 0% again. And many of you would think that: "" why isn't he just going to stop playing volleyball?"" The problem is that i know i've got gifts for this sport so i don't wan't to stop. This has gotten so bad that i have gotten suicidal thoughts and i have cried myself to sleep everyday for the last 5 weeks. I am tired of this. What should i do?

,depression,"I've just found this account. I'm still hating my life. So take this wall of text...
I still haven't accomplished what I want. Things got quieter/calmer, got plenty of time to meditate on the issues, but in no way got better.

--&gt; My parents needed help, so I went back at their home since a few years (multi-family home). 

They're getting old, they're alone and they're starting to have health issues. I planned my whole life to move away and fulfill my dreams in another country where my friends are, visa planned and everything.
Now I am fucked.  
Lost friends, no gf, dropped uni (medicine), no job, have no time to improve i.e. no e-learning.  
I'm doing all the chores a big farmhouse needs. Think huge land, think huge house, think not enough money to be on autopilot... as I'm not a millionaire it's hell. On top of that, there's pretty much everything to fix, from house stuff to land/lawn/tools/machinery. Add that's in the middle of nowhere.  
My time is fragmented, there's always something to do at the worst time.

I am at home, I could enjoy it but I don't feel at home. It's a weird feeling.  

So much going in my head that I lost the tranquility I'd need to start a project/online job/course and stick to it.
My brain is constantly crashing either by the long to-do lists/stuff to fix/chores or frequently clashing against my ""wannabe life"".
Every time I think about my wannabe life things just get worse as I get bad-tempered quite easily. Maybe this is why I prefer to be alone most of the time, no matter how much harder the job will be.
Hate the place, I've lost the old friends I had here as I lived elsewhere for the last 15 years. Now many either moved or have families.  
Hate the dullness/monotony of a small town in the middle of nowhere.
I have literally every object I could desire. I'm living in a beautiful house, but I am so sad you couldn't believe it. I'm doing it day by day, but I'm swearing like a sailor...
Do you know that feeling when you realize you own every object you thought you really wanted, yet you aren't enjoying it as they don't really make you happy or you aren't happy to enjoy them? Multiply it by ~1000.  

I've literally put my life on hold, for a while. I am right now not able to steer it in the direction I'd like.  

I've got no big money, no gf, no hobbies.  
My friends now are all doctors, lawyers, realtors, and such, living the high life 100k plus.  
Sometimes I hear them complaining of such small things like they were huge issues, ""first-world problems"". Fuck, they should try what I am experiencing daily. It makes me mad, and that's why I don't even reach them anymore.
  
I should leave the country and enjoy life, but I think it as too selfish now that my parents need help.
So I'm stuck in a tunnel I can't find a way out. My brain screams run away, my heart says you cannot do it. And this happens every day from the moment I wake up.  

No absolutely any kind of job opening available in quite a distant radius, now with covid is even worse than ever.
I'm doing some small jobs online just to get some money and not to completely burn my emergency fund, as I don't want to live completely off my parents' money.

But it's hard. It's mentally hard to keep track of all of this. I think I've reached the bottom of emotions, really I feel can't go any lower. 

I've been so accustomed to this situation that I am becoming emotionless. 
I'm not going out anymore as I feel I have nothing to say and I'll get bored quickly. 
You know when you talk with friends about life progress/work/marriage/kids that kind of talks...

I'm not self-harming or into drugs or anything, I discovered through these difficult times that I'm stronger than I thought. 
I kinda know that I've reached what's my lower level of emotions and I'm bouncing on it. It's a good robust support.
But it's still hard and weird when everyone in the room is happy and you are the only one not smiling. And this happens in every room...

I’m walking through the cold blizzard in the winter and I can’t even see where I’m going anywhere and it’s so cold and I’m so tired and everyone has left me or disappeared and I just want to lay down and rest for a little while but I know that the snow and cold will freeze me, but as more time goes on I forget more and more why I’m still trying so hard to make it through this storm, or even if the storm will ever let up

Toxic relationships can be explained like this:you have a shitty poker hand but you would rather stick with your shitty hand than risk getting a new one that could be even worse and just pray for anything you can get out of your hand

It’s better to be a punching bag that gets used than a punching bag that gets thrown out because it can’t do it’s job. It’s not possible for punching bags to get hands and become real fighters but it’s An analogy so who knows

I’m different (friends name) I don’t do things like everyone else I don’t smell things like everybody else I can’t solve problems or fit in like y’all and if that’s something that bores you after awhile then I’m sorry but I can’t change to be like everybody else

The three stages: something happens and I get super worked up and pissed and oh my god my life is over I’m fucked. Part two is fuck I hate myself I hate my life fuck me
Meeting with whoever, talking it out with whoever, thinking it over and motivating myself and deciding I’m finna do better with my life. This can come from wanting to do better, self loathing becoming your a piece of shit you need to get your act together, or help from others
I feel like there’s no point, I lose the desire to get motivated I don’t want to do it anymore and I just want to give up, which cycles back to wanting to give up on stage 1 creating an endless cycle.

,depression,"I’ve been admitted into the psychiatric hospital 2 times in the passed 4 years. I wanted to keep it at 2 but I don’t know if that will be happening, I can feel myself going insane again. 

I have nothing going for me. The only person I loved, who said they loved me back, was lying to me. According to them they never really loved me and they simply used me to satiate their craving for a relationship. I’m a joke to everyone.  I don’t want to live as a joke.

But it was hard clearing my mind; My thoughts run rapid like a white river.

Unrestrained,

best left untouched,

but used as a bipolar campaign.

I use to have a dam.

One that worked,

and could have stand for another decade.

With big bold words,

painted on its walls.

""I have no problems;""

the saying said,

and in return to finish this motto,

""You have no problems.""

It felt like lies,

parroting these words that hurt,

and have others say the same things worked.

For it kept the walls maintained,

and strong.

Until one day the dam crumble,

with no cause.

There's a little voice who conspired it,

to be an inside job.

But conspiracy won't save or rebuild the dam.

For the man-made lake flooded the world.

The system that tried to take back control.

Couldn't stop the poison sinking into the soil;

feeding the trees and the wildlife

who depend on this water to live.

The strong currents of these emotions,

pulled me under it's rapid white surface.

No one could see or find me right then,

I'd be miles down river dead or by chance breathing.

Being pushed and bashed,

against the boulders.

Scrapes and bruises,

appear on my skin.

Broken bones that snapped like twigs.

The air in my lungs burn,

as I try not to breathe in but it will be replaced,

with what I tried to keep out.

25 seconds seems to be my limit.

Adapt to change is better than remaining the same,

but this dreamer turned into a fish; a salmon.

The season will come,

when I'll have to make the journey up river again.

Back through the memories.

Inside an old reverie.

Hoping by chance,

I won't get caught in the jaws of a bear,

or be lured away by a fisherman's bait.

Pushing my way up in the deepness of my pain,

Until I reached the end.

The cycle then begins again.

Why?

Because I've died from the exhaustion,

Never stopping until I met the goals end.

It's a cruel nature to live in,

but there are positive things that happen.

My body,

will rot with nutrients,

My children,

will grow and start the story again.

It's a rebirth,

of living and dying.

Lying and crying.

Holding back what should never be said.

It's better to hold your tongue than let a sharp edge slip.

Repressing my emotions,

not to feel.

A decision made not to heal.

I want to escape the fate I placed myself in,

This environment,

that's my oppression.

At the same time,

my own aggression.

We're not the same,

you and I.

This empathy we feel,

is probably all we'll have.

This song and poem will be said,

to be the same,

Yet, our lyrics are different,

the tunes and beats.

Maybe they'll switch.

We both know it was organic,

what we wrote and feel in the moment.

The mental illness I have,

is a drug and disease.

I already don't trust anyone,

so why should I speak?

They keep comparing me to them and others.

I'm not the same,

if I am.

Then why am I not cured like them?

I think it's time I finish what I wrote.

My eyes are red from the salt.

I pick the worse time to cry.

I thank you for reading,

so, for right now.

,depression,"I'm depressed. I'm in my mid 20's and I've been so since I was a teenager. It wasn't a constant stream of it, it was more like peaks and valleys, but nontheless it was there. The thing with it is that it just gets worse. The peaks that used to be the tops of mountains now are barely hills and every new valley is deeper and darker than the one I passed before.

The worst of it is that I know is something inside my head. There's something inside that I must fix in order to reach a plateau . A sunny one. Because I know what I have to do in order to reach it. It's not really that hard, I've done it a number of times already. But I just can't be bothered to. The effort seems too big and the results will fade with time. I will let them fade because it's comfortble and easy that way. Maybe I'm just used to it. Maybe I've just done it so many times that is in my nature. Maybe I'm just looking for a struggle and since I can't seem to fin it outside my head I create it inside of it. The problem is when finally something happens outside and I'm not up to the task because all my energy is focused inside of me. And I just see it pass me, as other things have passed me before. And here we are again, sinking deeper and deeper into the botomless pit. Thinking I'm trying to swim to the top when in reality I know I'm barely moving my feet. I like the darkness, I don't want to like it but I do. And I like it because every second I listen to it I take another step down. And there's nothing I want more in this moment than to go down.

Funny thing isn't it. Winter came and brought with it what it always brings. Last year I went as deep as I'd never went before and thought I'd learned from it. I did, but not as much as I thought. But now here I am. Thinking of walking that path again in hopes of achieving god knows what. Who am I trying to fool, I know exactly what I'm after. 

I've always thought of myself as a collection of I's, my native tongue doesn't have a distinction between Me and I as english does and I believe the latter makes more sense, I wanted to make that clear but for the sake of grammar I'll use me from now on.

Each different me has different objectives, and they fight for the control of my mind. They are not different from me, they are me.  They are carried by emotions and they are mostly blinded by them so its hard for them to see the bigger picture, they need me for that. But they don't always listen and I don't always want to fight against them, and to be honest sometimes I just let them free, even in situations in which I know I shouldn't do so. Right now I've let one of those I's to control my head, the witty snake crept on me and whisper by whisper convinced me to lower my guard and let it in. And now I'm numbed, and my will is lost and I just want to hear it's sweet voice whispering inside my head saying how useless I am. And by doing so I'm making it's point true. And I'm guided by him even deeper.

I usually write posts like this and never post them, I think that I write them more for myself than for anyone else but I'll change that for today. Maybe is that naiff hope that someone will give me the key to open the lock and break free of these chains or maybe sharing it is a step in the right direction.

But they don&amp;#39;t always listen and I don&amp;#39;t always want to fight against them, and to be honest sometimes I just let them free, even in situations in which I know I shouldn&amp;#39;t do so. Right now I&amp;#39;ve let one of those I&amp;#39;s to control my head, the witty snake crept on me and whisper by whisper convinced me to lower my guard and let it in. And now I&amp;#39;m numbed, and my will is lost and I just want to hear it&amp;#39;s sweet voice whispering inside my head saying how useless I am. And by doing so I&amp;#39;m making it&amp;#39;s point true. And I&amp;#39;m guided by him even deeper.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I usually write posts like this and never post them, I think that I write them more for myself than for anyone else but I&amp;#39;ll change that for today. Maybe is that naiff hope that someone will give me the key to open the lock and break free of these chains or maybe sharing it is a step in the right direction. This last one bothers me because I have friends that care for me and I should be talking about this with them and not with strangers on the internet, but I don&amp;#39;t have the balls for it. Maybe this thought will cause enough anxiety to go and talk with them.&lt;/p&gt;

 It had phases were things were calmer and I could deal with it. 13 years later, things are not better.
Since months ago got out of a toxic relationship. I loved him deeply, and would do anything for him. He was violent. Funny how things are. I guess that's what I thought love was. Started out light I guess, my through the years it escalated. I don't even know what to say or feel about it all honestly. He gastlighted me a lot. Made me feel like I was exaggerating. That it was my fault. I tripped. I made him mad. And then would come the honey moon phase. The person who made me feel like shit was my savior. My brain, trying to get away from the situation, started to depersonalize. This started happening 3 years ago. There is a lot I don't remember. Most of the violent episodes per say, I don't remember. I remember seeing the angry look in his eyes and then feeling the pain.
I wasn't always violent. We had good moments, has probably everyone does. We lived together 4 years. No one knew the entire time. I tried to kill myself and thought of killing myself during that time. And after. Kinda wondering how would it be now.
Since I broke up, the depersonalization stayed. Acompanyed by PTSD, and anxiety attacks and ofc, the depression (this was diagnosed by my therapist).
There are days were I still can't leave the house. Spend my days crying, not understanding if I have any worth or not.
Thought that finishing my college degree would help and make me feel better. Worked for that. The day I knew I had graduated, feel genuine happiness for about an hour. Then, the same emptiness.
What is the point? What am I fighting for, if I end up feeling the same? I just wanna quit. 
Tired of not being able to breathe, this constant weight on my chest. Depersonalization in and out, and not being able to control it.
Being with someone, on a physical level, and needing their approval. Feeling unworthy. Ugly. Ridiculous. Hearing my ex's voice in my head saying ""you are a piece of shit. You disgust me"".

Sometimes I ask myself ""why am I like this?"" and I just don't understand. 
My Asian parents don't understand either..they say I never talk to them but I tried a lot of times: I told them that I can't make friends because of my social anxiety and they replied ""you're just weird and too introverted and nobody wants to be friends with you,stop embarassing us"" and when I told them I wanted to see a therapist they said ""why are you seeking attention?

The funny thing is that I always stay alone and definitely do not seek attention,because it scares me even just to look someone into their eyes.

I pratically finished highschool: the 17 of this month I&amp;#39;ll have to do the final exam and because of the pandemic..it will be an oral test with all the school subject+a ppt  presentation and let&amp;#39;s be honest..I haven&amp;#39;t started to study yet and anxiety is killing me...the main problem is one:  it&amp;#39;s an ORAL TEST and I suffer from social anxiety,I&amp;#39;ll probably panic and stutter,my mind can&amp;#39;t work things out. I have mixed feelings rn and don&amp;#39;t know what to do..this world and this life are disappointing me so much..I want to end it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sorry for this long and confused post,I just wanted to vent out my feelings.&lt;/p&gt;

,depression,"Sorry for bad language. I am from Ukraine and used to live all my life in Russia. Earlier my skill was better, but now I have to catch up and Reddit helps me a lot with this.

So.

Now it’s almost three years I had strongest feeling like I just forgot how to live life as normal person. Three years ago my mother had stroke and whole family just rejected to help her, except me. 

Back to these days I lived in a small city in Russia — Belgorod. I had a job that I really liked, but the salary was just enough to live in this city, so my help was insignificant. Even with the financial support of my friends (about them later), I had to get into huge debts, and I still pay some of them. I didn't know then that some *close* people would be very dangerous and soon I would start receiving threats. My mistake was to give too optimistic deadlines. This continues until now, although it is easier for me to bear such episodes now.

But that's not the point, and I'll get over it sooner or later anyway. Or no. Whatever.

The point is that I have lost all control over my life after the stroke. I was often filled with anxiety for my mother and for myself. Often there was no explanation for this anxiety at all, and this made me even more afraid. I started having panic attacks. I broke up with my girlfriend and moved back to Moscow, where I tried to restart life on a more positive note. But even here there were constant problems.

A new job in the studio seemed like the job of my dreams, but I received my salary once every 4 months (I quit 8 months ago and still haven't received all the money). Since I am from Ukraine, it was a difficult task to get an official job, so I can’t do anything with situations like this. However, for the first two months, I did feel that my mental state was improving. I saw good old friends and tried not to be alone for too long. Once I even opened my *club* for reading fairy tales aloud to unknown people via Discord. I just like to read aloud, even though it didn't work out very well at first.

And then everything came back with a double. 

I've been crying in the mornings for two years now. I've lost all interest in life and I just don't know where to go. It's hard for me to get used to the fact that I don't want anything at all. Even worse, I probably wouldn’t want to. In recent weeks at my new job, I came to the office on weekends. There was no one there and I just sat all day alone, looking at the wall and thinking about how great it would be to finish everything. Just in one moment. I was out for a smoke and stare at the sharp fence below, wondering how much it would hurt to fall on it. And this thought was so commonplace and so clear that later I would feel uneasy again. I’ve learned that I don’t afraid to die anymore.

Of course, I wanted to see a therapist, but almost always there was no money for it. One day my good friend offere me MDMA as great thing (it was), so I tried without hesitation. After two years of my illness it was beautiful reminder that I can really love myself and deserve to be loved. On the next day I cried again, but the next two weeks I was in really good mood. I didn't continued taking drugs because of fear of addiction (my father died from heroin overdose and used me in my childhood to hide it from police. Long story), but at least it kept me from jumping on that fence earlier.

Right now, my life is taking place in an apartment. Not because of COVID, but because I feel so comfortable here in my room. I still cry in the mornings. I work from home 24/7 to avoid being alone with my thoughts, but sometimes I have to give myself a break — then I watch a movie or have a drink (twice a month maybe), thinking about a better life, if it works at all.

I began to distance myself from my friends. Sometimes I do not write to them for 2-3 months busy with work, and then return as if nothing had happened, but for them it was strange. They just got used to me and can't trust me the way they used to. Almost all of them are already in the past, and I can't blame them for that. That’s life, as Sinatra singed.

This post is not a cry for help, but now I feel like I have spoken something out and I feel a little better. That's good for now. I still have a little hope for better days — the days without anxiety, threats, problems with job and everything else that makes me suffer every second after I wake and before I sleep. 

In fact, I really don’t know what to do, but I learn to be optimistic step by step. To enjoy the little things. Hope we’re all will learn these things someday, because we have no reasons to be bad to each other. And what is really important — I learn now how to be a good person. It feels like I've betrayed a lot of people, and that shame is probably my biggest problem. It's hard for me to love myself, and without that love I can’t do anything right.

,depression,"Happy moments feel like heaven, sad ones feel like hell. If you dare to say something different, your ""S.O."" would be upset and make you suffer, then gaslight you. 

I want to remember how to be happy again. But I can't forget how I got raped when I was a child, how I tried to kill myself, how I started having a talk with myself daily like a crazy person, how I stopped contacting everyone around me and isolating myself. I can't forget how I lost my best friends and faced racism in this new country. 

&amp;#x200B;

You can't imagine how many times I came to this sub to write my story and just stopped. Crying feels good for a moment, then you're all alone. Every happy moment is around me, it doesn't make me feel anything at all. Family is around me, can't feel anything. Therapy didn't help and made me more insecure. ""You should take those meds""...

&amp;#x200B;

I did. I failed a lot of my subjects and had to work harder than ever. Stopped taking them and left my previous toxic relationship. Started feeling great, then got hit with the ""why are you alone here?"". I'm just carrying the insecurities and traumas from my childhood and partner. I can't solve it on my own, but I don't want anyone to cause me new ones. ""We"" got hooked into each other, then gaslighting, toxic behavior started. Now, I need to cry a lot and force myself into healing again.

&amp;#x200B;

I can't trust my family nor my friends. ""Stop feeling sad"" isn't gonna change me. I experienced how to be ugly and beautiful, to be poor and rich, to be powerless and powerful, from bad to good. I don't want to leave to understand what I could accomplish. My bright future? It's awesome, yeah. Then what? I have little info about every basic thing. I'm unable to provide myself any emotional support. I couldn't grow up in a right way. Even my father wasn't there. 

&amp;#x200B;

Crying is an endless loop. Feels good, then you start thinking, then you start crying again. Masturbating is also good, but you get addicted. You start having issues, pimples, shitty thoughts, side effects, etc. Taking meds is also good, but once you try escaping... It's a living hell. Talking to someone is also good, until they start analyzing you and treating you based on your given info or start using it against you. Doing my hobbies, hitting the gym, everything else feels good, but it's temporary. 

&amp;#x200B;

I think I lack affection and love. I lack physical touch. Even my ex wasn't near me. It was a long-distance and she cheated on me and made me feel horrible. Even the current one isn't near me, there's a travel ban. I asked her to talk to me instead of leaving me alone because she joked about ""ending the relationship"" just to tease me. What affection, if my partner can't even match any love. 

&amp;#x200B;

I can't imagine the times I gave my love to my ex, when I thought she's the one. 5 years went into the drain. I'm exhausted, what's next? Why should I keep going? Achievements feel great for a moment, then what? My therapist said I should pretend everything is okay and do what I have on the list and just not think about the future. 

&amp;#x200B;

So basically, I'm playing dumb and just ignoring my crisis. Even If I explain my whole situation, it's gonna only make me feel worse and pity about myself.

&lt;p&gt;How could I have ever thought that I could do better with my life? I’m literally just a fucking failure. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first time I failed, I thought, maybe this is just a lesson, that everything doesn’t come as easily, that I need to try harder. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But I realized it’s just that just scoring right below is a metaphor for my whole life. Having something right in front of me so close and knowing that I could never get to it.&lt;/p&gt;

Now yes like any couple we argue but our fights are loud and sometimes I call her names and she does the same a lot of cussing and just screaming. We live together she plays over watch and has her own friends group and I have the same two guys I’ve know for years but she changes friends group always but majority are other guys she claims some of them are gay whatever one day I had to work late and she claimed she was going to a friends house to spend the night I said sure I’ll see you in the morning or later on. Well I got home and someone like me plays negative scenarios in there head I look through her things, computer and what not and I find she has been having a relationship on the side we are still only dating but at this point have are at 5 years together and our own apartment I was in so much pain I cried all night and I was blowing her phone up of course no answer she had screenshots of the conversations she had and he gave her his address well a address I decided to go to it and there was no one. She shut her phone off and I didn’t know what to do I was frantic going nuts balling crying I just didn’t know 

Finally she showed up to work still drunk I went in and told her we need to talk she left work we went home and I told her I know what she’s been doing behind my back and she kinda just shrugs it off and it hurts because she doesn’t care we fight and then she brakes down and decides to stay with me I say ok like a dumbass.

&lt;p&gt;Is this normal? I just want to be good-looking and loved by my peers, social media makes me think even more negatively because I see how beautiful everyone is and how good of a time they&amp;#39;re having...&lt;/p&gt;

,depression,"Hi there people of reddit. 

I have made a blog post about depression. I know how painful it is. I also know what it's like to gain a sort of zest for life again. 

I feel like my life purpose is to show people that life is worth living. I guess this is my first step towards doing so.

Have a read if you wish. 

I really hope it helps in some kind of way. 

Just know that you are loved and that life is 100% worth living 

Thanks 

Francesco.

,depression,"Hello, everyone. How are you guys doing?

I'm not so good. It's been a long long time now. Of course the last couple of months have been weirder, harder, and got me where I am currently.

Sorry if this is long. I decided to not post a lot of times  because this is not interesting at all, but I decided I should at least vent. 

Depression killed me. Not literally, sure, here I am writing all this... But I am definitely dead. Or the person I should be, at least. 

I have been dealing with depression and its correlates for more than 10 years so far, and the endgame is... I look around me and I could have been so much more. I had will. I had passions. I was good at so many thing. I still am, somewhere under all this garbage. I could write wonderfully! I was so goddamn smart. I believed in myself, at least a little bit. I wasn't so sure I am indeed a failure, but now I am. I wasn't so sure I would be sad no matter what, but now I am.
 
Time carrying this stinky, messy, loud goat called depression crushed it all. I can't do... Anything. 

I only need to write my thesis to get my degree, but I can't. I don't see why. I sit in front of my computer and I cannot write. It's been 1 year and a half, now, and every single person involved in the process is frustrated. All my colleagues moved on, they did it. I didn't. I just hate myself.

Similarly, I need to find a job. I am 26 years old and I'm currently unemployed without a single idea of what I should do. It's so difficult to grasp something I would be good doing, or would enjoy. Of course somehow it never works out for me. I don't have the confidence, or the curriculum, or the experience, or the courage to apply. I also don't seem to think anything at all would suit me or would make me happy. I look at all my friends working and I wonder ""how did they do it?"".

All the things I think could make me at least a bit happy are so, so, so unattainable and distant. 

With time I lost the will to talk to people. It's so hard to maintain a good friendship. And it's my fault.
I have no degree and it's my fault. 
I have no job and it's my fault. 
I have no pleasure and it's my fault.

I am sitting in a park and the day is so beautiful, but why can't I enjoy it? Why am I so sad and so distraught all the time? Why is it so hard to see a way out? 

And don't get me wrong. I take medication and see a therapist weekly. For years and years. That's why I am not literally dead, I guess.

My mum has had depression for 5 years. This is the first time she tried to kill herself.

Last night she came into my room and told me to take care of myself and my dad. I thought it was weird out of the blue.. and I told her everything is okay, nothing will happen to her and that I loved her. Those are the last things I said to her before I went to bed.

,depression,"I have a really complicated situation that I really can't see any solution to, so I'm turning to Reddit...

I'm at a loss. I feel like nothing is worth it anymore. I feel like I am a no one and that I have nothing. That I have no one.  I have no motivation to do anything, literally. I'm barely eating and drinking water, started smoking again. I stopped working out, reading books, living healthy altogether. I've been having many suicidal thoughts - I have three different plans... It just feels so easy to get out of this mess... I lost my job, my girfriend broke up with me in March and since then, it's only been getting worse. I have no one - except for my family, who I fight with every time we see each other. So I don't have them either. I've been seening a psychologist as well but to no avail...

On the other hand, every now and then I get these bumps of motivation. I feel like I can do anything and be anyone, I'm as happy as I've ever been and just want to enjoy life. I feel like eating healthy again, working out, looking for a job and doing something with my life. And then it all fades away. In an instant. I start feeling like I might as well just die and everything will be, well, unsure whether better or worse, but at least different. And I'd really take those odds... I don't know. I am grateful for a lot of things but for me, thinking about it and repeating it out loud just changes nothing. My psychologist and everyone, really, has been saying - ""Just give yourself time, you'll get over it"". And  yeah, I'm not crying because of that breakup anymore, but now I want to die. It's been three months and it's getting worse.

It's mostly because of my girlfriend, though. We didn't officially break up, we just took a break. And we did that before, it's no different this time. Whenever things got rough. I know, it's not the best way to go, but it works for us. After every one of these breaks, it felt like it's not going anywhere again. And then it did. It's no different now, but again, it feels like I lost the love of my life and I don't know what to do... Everyone just says that she wasn't that great and I admit that there were 100 things right and 1000 things wrong about her, but that's who she is. Everyone's saying that there's other girls at least just like her, if not even better but I just can't imagine that. I can't go outside and meet people either, not this year anyway, because of what's happening.

I've tried planning my day and just working on myself but it always only works for a really short amount of time and I fall back in this thing. What should I do? I don't want to kill myself, but if I see no other option, I'll just go ahead and do that... I want to get that motivation, start working out and jogging and hiking, eating healthy, reading, working a job that I actually like, I want to spend time with my family and ammend things and I've really tried but it never works out.

,depression,"Im not sure what I want to achieve by posting this but I probably want to know if other people share the same Feeling and maybe a few tips on how to handle my feelings.

Im 23 and basically I can't remember a moment where I was REAL happy. Im german so my english is not that good and its a bit harder for me to explain but ill do my best.

Basically my only feeling of happiness is ""hey its pretty cool"". 
Even as a kid when I was like 10 and my parents gave me videogame console on christmas I could not feel any real happiness (like a kid jumping around,being happy etc) it was just ""cool"". 

(Money and things doeant make anyone happy I know but thats basically stuff where most kids go crazy).

And basically this translates in every other Situation..

When I finished school with actual good grades it was just ""cool/okay"", when I found a new good job it was just ""cool"" and in a week im gonna write my final exam,ive learned 3 hours daily for the past 4 months and even if i get good grades.. I wont be super happy,its ""cool"" then.

Id describe the ""cool"" feeling as the following Situation : You found a Dollar on the street,it gives you a lil smile on the face but wont make you go crazy basically because you cant do anything with the dollar anyway.
Its like people rate their happiness from 0 to 10 but I simply cannot go over 5.

Personally im fine with feeling that way,i never went crazy because i were that happy and thats okay,so I cant miss that. But people around me are going crazy,like my girlfriend. She expects me to do a backflip whenever I see her. But I simply cannot feel THAT happy just because I see her (or any other friend). I really love her and I love to see her but I cannot simply be super happy just because we see each other.

On birthday or christmas I see myself acting happy over the presents because I do not want to dissappont anyone.

&lt;p&gt;Personally im fine with feeling that way,i never went crazy because i were that happy and thats okay,so I cant miss that. But people around me are going crazy,like my girlfriend. She expects me to do a backflip whenever I see her. But I simply cannot feel THAT happy just because I see her (or any other friend). I really love her and I love to see her but I cannot simply be super happy just because we see each other.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On birthday or christmas I see myself acting happy over the presents because I do not want to dissappont anyone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Theres not a single moment in my life where I had tears of happiness in my eyes,not a single moment where I said &amp;quot;I&amp;#39;ll remember this Situation&amp;quot; because of a good reason.&lt;/p&gt;

,depression,"This is my last resort because I have no one to say this to. I'm a 16 y/o female and I feel like I have so many things going for me but my joy for living has faded and I don't care about anything anymore. I was born in a third world country with verbally and sometimes physically abusive parents who fled to America to build a future for me and get me here safely. At the time of me living in another country, I was happy because I thought that everyone's lives were dull and I just had to deal with it. when I turned 11, I began to learn stuff about my past that made me realize that I had a shitty childhood and those memories were repressed (examples: grandpa and uncle were killed by a gang, grandma stole $40,000 from my life savings to try to save them which didn't work, mom was beaten and raped by her father, dad was physically/verbally abused by his entire family, etc). Once I started making friends in my school I realized it was not normal to have such a traumatic childhood and that this was the reason I never truly felt happy. Throughout middle school, I was bullied and I felt misunderstood. When high school started I became pressured to take on the hardest classes and activities because my parents and everyone told me that doing them would make me successful. While I didn't believe them, I still did them because I was basically bullied into doing them. By sophomore year of high school, I started to get severe migraines and my mom only took me to a neurologist when I started to faint because of them and being so stressed. Now that I'm a junior in high school, the amount of work I had to do throughout the day caused me to repress my feelings and not have to deal with them. I had to be at school and volunteer from 7am-7pm most days which gave me a way out of my family life and also a reason to neglect my mental health. I became super competitive with everyone and closed myself off because of the culture in my school and the pressure to get into elite colleges. When I came home from school, I would sleep from 7pm-10pm to avoid my family and wake up when they went to sleep just to do homework and go to school. I became a robot but every time I tried to tell anyone they would say ""you did this to yourself"" or they just wouldn't understand. Yes, I chose to take on the challenge, but that doesn't mean I don't deserve to get a break or to have a good support system. When school ended because of corona, I suddenly had no responsibilities so essentially two years worth of ignoring my mental health and suppressing memories came to me and now I feel more numb than ever. I recently tried to ask my mom for a therapist when quarantine is lifted, and she told me that I haven't experienced any trauma and that I should be happy to be in America. I already know I have symptoms of ADHD, depression, PTSD, and anxiety and if I were diagnosed with what I have it would help me learn how to be happy despite having those illnesses. She then refused which means that I can only get a therapist if I pay for it. My parents also want me to marry a rich man and have children just to make my future husband not leave me. Later on I realized my mom had me because her family forced her to and also so my dad would not leave her. I kinda understand them because they come from a country where the sole purpose of life is marriage and children but I don't want to live that way. I want to travel, practice medicine, and live a happy life with a significant other. I personally am not a fan of children, but my mom says they are the only reason for people to keep living. when I told my mom I want to be a surgeon, she told me to be a nurse because that is a man's job and I need to stay home to take care of my children. My family abuses me, I constantly have to do schoolwork and extracurriculars, my friends don't understand me, and I don't know what to do anymore. I don't want to die because I'm scared of what comes after but I also don't want to live. I sleep 13 hours a day just to avoid everything/everyone.

,depression,"I have this friend. Everybody knows her as a resillient person. She assumes an aura of mental fortitude, and is readily open to listen to others ranting about their own problems. She is jokingly called by many of us as the psychiatrist friend. I myself have ranted to her about my problems way more than I should. When I attempted to commit suicide, she was the first person to told about my plans. Since I know about my friend's mental issues better now, I've stopped or at least tried to stop venting out to her about my problems.

I've always worried that she isn't as strong as she claims to be. That she is just hiding her own pain for the sake of others. Time and time again, I told her that she should vent out to me just like I do to her since it is only fair. Or maybe, she should talk about her feelings to her parents, or any friend whom she can be 100% honest to. However, she has said that she doesn't want to be a burden on anyone, so she never says anything about the bad things she feels.

Her willingness to help others extends even to guys in our university's anime club. Not to offend any otakus out there, but because my friend showed kindness and listened to their problems, they've grown attached to her to the point that some have fallen in love with her, causing jealousy issues within the club. Of course, this stresses her out, but she doesn't want to admit it.

I don't want to antagonize the anime club, but I have a feeling that my friend is uncomfortable with the guys there. She constantly tells me that while she is willing to listen to the guys ranting and laying their emotions bare, she doesn't trust them at all to open up about her own emotions. She fears that the guys might use her emotions against her in some way. Personally, I think she should leave the club, not necessarily because the guys are bad people, but because she needs some sort of mental clarity. None of the guys in the club know about this and are unaware of her true mental state. 

I told her as a last resort that if she doesn't want to talk to a friend or a family member, she should go to the student counselor or go to therapy. But then, she says that she doesn't want to depend on therapy to fix her problems because she is afraid that she will become dependent on it forever and never become better. I want to believe that this is not true, but I do not know how to convince her that therapy is worth it. She even mentioned that the cost of therapy might badly affect her parents since they would have to spend on her medical bills.

She has given so many excuses on why she doesn't need to seek help and I am at a loss on how to help her.

&lt;p&gt;You are like an ant that is marked by &amp;#39;death&amp;#39; pheromones. They simply throw you out and then rationalize it to avoid their conscience from poking them. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You manage to crawl out of your grave. There is an option there, you can go back to your old life. But now everything is different. Why bother with any of this, if they will run away from you like a bunch of mindless animals whenever you&amp;#39;re in pain? Everything is goddamn fake. We are just bags of meat mind controlled by our instincts.&lt;/p&gt;

,depression,"Sorry for the english.

I don't know if this is the right place to post this story, but here it goes.
I (22M) had a difficult time growing up since I got cancer when I was about 14 years old.
I got pretty shy and really didn't care about anything at the time, my parents were always super protective, rarely leetting me go out to parties, etc.
I didn't care at first, but time goes by and today I see myself with apathetic with no emotions, no will to live.

I'm going to a psychiatrist for about 1 year, taking my meds for depression, anxiety (plus the pills I take for cancer).

Currently I work in a good place, go to college of engineering, have friends, play guitar, games, etc.
But none of this ""fills the gap for happiness"".
The question I want to ask is about woman, since I don't have experience and confidence because of my past.
A date, a romantic partner can help me go past this moment and start enjoying my life?

,depression,"It got real bad. My lowest point for sure. Never felt more alone, and isolated. Started thinking of all the ways I could end it. I was just over it. Out of nowhere, a friend messaged me. I ended up telling him about feeling suicidal. He revealed he went through a similar thought pattern in the past as well, and pointed me in the direction of a crisis line to call. He made me promise him to exhaust all my options first before continuing on with my current thoughts. 

I finally gathered up the courage to call, never cried more in my life. I felt bad for the social worker who assessed me, as she had the difficult task of making out what I was trying to say through my heavy sobs. Cried for basically the entire assessment. She deemed my case to be urgent, and got me booked with a psychiatrist the next day. And also referred me to a suicide prevention counselling clinic place called the SAFER program. 

First time speaking to a psychiatrist, was so nervous he wasn’t going to be nice for some reason. He turned out to be nice, to my relief. Told me I had a depressive disorder. So basically depression. Prescribed me two types antidepressants. One of them is primarily for treating my insomnia that I’ve developed over the years. 

Actually, before the appointment with the psychiatrist, I got a call from SAFER who also booked my first therapy session with a counsellor. Then proceeded to cry some more during the psychiatrist appointment. Who also was super concerned about my case. 

Spoke with the counsellor from SAFER for the first therapy session a few days ago, went great. Still cried, but not nearly as much as during the assessment with the social worker. I’m supposed to keep going with therapy now for once a week. For the foreseeable future. 

Even just talking to these 3 different people really helped make me feel just a little bit lighter. I think the meds are also starting to do it’s thing. I don’t feel the urge as strongly, but they’re definitely still there. I still have thoughts like, you know, I could just end if now but running in front of a speeding car. Or jumping in front of a train. And then it’ll all be over.

But for now, I’m hanging on. For now. I’ve been telling myself to sleep on it. Every time I have a suicidal thought, sleep on it. Let’s see if I still feel as strong about it still the next day. And usually that urge or thought feels less intense.

,depression,"Yesterday, I broke off a casual relationship that just wasn’t working for me. The guy clearly didn’t care as much about me as I cared about him, and the lack of balance was making me really upset and causing me to question my self-worth. I stayed with him for longer than I should’ve, though, because I convinced myself that being in any relationship at all was better than being single and feeling hopeless. I’m 21, and this is only the second relationship I’ve ever been in (and the first wasn’t that great either). 20 years of constant rejections by crushes who could only see me as a friend absolutely destroyed my self-esteem and caused me to latch on to any guy who would actually go on more than one date with me.

,depression,"It's been happening for a couple of weeks now. I haven't been able to sleep for more than 4 hours straight.

I don't think it began happening after anything in particular, but I always do end up waking up due to the same thing: some kind of negative thought/dream. It's gotten a lot worse recently because my puppy that we had for over 10 years just passed away. It happened very suddenly, so we didn't get the chance to make her last days special. I've been feeling a lot of guilt, just wishing that I would have made her life better overall, especially these last few months that I didn't even know were her last.

I feel a lot of guilt about a lot of things. I never know how to forgive myself for the mistakes I've made or the things I thought I should have done better. I live too much in the past, and then feel more guilt about not doing more in the present. It's a vicious cycle and I have no idea how to end it. I don't know how to be happy anymore, just how to distract myself from feeling sad *all* the time, but I guess I can't escape my problems in my dreams anymore.

I'm not sure how to take the world off my own shoulders. I've had the attitude that I needed to be there for others, yet put myself on the back-burner my whole life. I think it started by listening to my mom gripe about my dad and trying to tell her everything would be okay and never telling her how sad it made me that their marriage was so loveless. This was my whole childhood, and it still goes on (if you're wondering why no divorce, my mom told me she'd consider it if only we had enough money to afford one).

I don't know how to care about me. I'm starting to not even have the strength to care for others. It all seems so exhausting. I choose to be numb sometimes instead of worrying about others' problems now (and certainly instead of worrying about my own).

,depression,"I thought I should record this here in the hopes it might help someone else.

I'm 45 and have dealt with depression for decades.  I've had adverse reactions to every medication I've tried, and spent 20 years trying to numb everything away with alcohol.  I'm nine days away from two years of sobriety.  

I'm single, never married, never had kids.  I've had a few relationships but they just didn't last.  I'm not an easy person to live with, and at 45 the idea of a relationship exhausts me.  My last romantic relationship was twelve years ago.

I should exercise more.  I'm overweight and out of shape.  It's just not worth it to get healthier.  Honestly, why?  For who?  I have no desire to live longer than I need to.

I don't think I'm ugly but there's clearly something about me that is either unattractive or registers as 'off' about me.  It sucks.  I'm used to it.

I have a good job.  I have a home that's larger than I need.  My bills are paid.  There's food in my cabinets.  By all accounts I should be happy, or at least content.

Yet I break down every damn day.  More than a few times each day.  I get overwhelmed and the lonliness and despair sinks me low.  I struggle to put it aside, but I do, and then I keep moving on.

Some days I marvel at how much time has passed and how long I've hung on.  I wish I could see it as some sort of super power but it's not noble or brave.  It's just weird and pathetic. 

In my teens I decided that I wasn't going to check out mainly because it would have destroyed my mom.  I decided to wait until both she and my dad passed and then quietly slip away.

My mom is now in hospice and my dad is a wreck.  I don't really feel anything except maybe a sense of relief.  Once she passes away it'll just be my dad left.

Once he goes I'll pick up the bottle again.


I'm sure it'll be fairly quick and I'll finally find some peace.

So, we have a family friend who we'll call Dave. Dave has been living at our house for almost a year, he's been friends with my dad since they were in their 20's. It was cool, we would play guitar everyday, split a six pack every now and then and just hang out. He became one of my closest friends, despite him being 52 and me being 20. A few months ago him and my dad got into an argument, (Dave accused my dad of stealing from him and said he's a loser for being unemployed) but everyone was in between them including my little sister so it didn't end in a fight. Before he walked away he promised my dad that he would kick his ass.

Seeing that upset me and Dave even told me he was sorry and that he wouldn't hurt my dad. I told him it was okay and then cried myself to sleep. Dave started staying with my uncle who turned the garage into a little house so Dave didn't leave, I would hang out with him sometimes but not as much as before. He said he missed being with us, I said I wished things would just go back to normal and about a week later they did. Dave and my dad put things behind them and everything was cool.

I'm gonna speed through this part.
A week ago Dave moves into a motel for unrelated reasons and starts doing lots of meth. My parents borrow some money from him to buy groceries and stuff. Days later Dave sends my mom an email saying he wants to take her out and buy her any clothes she wants and take her out to any restaurant she wants, he says there's another way for her to repay the money but he has to tell her in person and if she agrees it had to be done right then and there. My dad obviously thinks this is weird.

Last night, Dave sends my mom a text saying he wants to talk to her and ""keep a promise"" with my dad. We all knew what that meant but when he showed up to the house we tried to keep things chill since nothing was stated outright. He asks my mom to talk and my dad walks with them, Dave says it's a private conversation and my dad says ""why do you need to have a private convo with my wife?""

Dave gets aggressive and says ""if you have a problem do something about it."" My dad tells him to relax and I hear a punch connect (I was standing around a corner listening). Mom starts yelling at Dave to stop and I see him holding my dad and punching him, adrenaline kicks in and I jump on Dave's back and start choking him and somehow manage to throw him into the front yard. We're all yelling at him to leave but he rushes my dad and again I start choking him, he lands a few elbows to my ribs which pisses my mom off and she jumps in, which only succeeds in getting herself punched in the face. I snapped and threw Dave down again and my dad beat the crap out of him. The cops were called and Dave was arrested since he started everything. 

I know that I was just protecting my family and I'll fight anyone who hits my mom but I can't shake this terrible guilt inside me. Why do I feel so shitty? That was obviously his intention when he came over, so why do I feel like I did something wrong? Why do I want to apologize when he attacked us? Why do I want to ask my parents to drop the charges?

,depression,"I need your help inderstanding my boyfriend (who has depressing episodes) better. I’m not looking for professional advise, but rather intel from experience. 

my boyfriend and I have been together for 7,5 years. During this time he has had some bad weeks and 3 very dark depression episodes while with me.

When he was 15 he was diagnosed with depressive episodes in combination with add. After this help he didn’t receive any more help in form of therapy and medication. 

I myself do not have depression (i do have anxiety and can relate to some extent) and have been trying to be as supportive as I can be. 

So this is where my question comes in: On three seperate occasions he has had bad dark depression episodes. In all of these occasions a very stressful thing was happening in his life. And in all of these occasions he turned on me and became very negative about me and our relationship; didn’t see any hope and was on the brink of breaking up. 
After his stress gets resolved, he is able to climb out of the dark spell and feels completely different about the relationship.

Right now we are on spell nr 3, and it’s a very bad one. Once again; i am the culprit of all evil. (Note; he never gets agressive or condescending or anything, just doesn’t see anything good about me or the relationship). This time round we have just gotten the news that after 1,5 years of looking our offer on a house has been accepted and in 2 months we move in. I think this is where the stress comes from.

What i want to know is if anyone has experienced something like that? He only does it to me and focusses his negativity on me. 

This is the third time now, and i’m just emotionally exhausted from being in the dark on my relationship, especially when we sign a contract in 2 months.. i made him talk to his parents (yes, even when he’s a grown ass man) and made him call his gp to schedule and appointment with a psychologist for the first time in 12 years. I’ve been nothing but understanding because i know he doesn’t do it on purpose.

What else can i do ? He pulls away from me. And do you think that his depression causes his doubts, or that his doubts seem to come out when he gets depressed?

I’m at a loss and want to help him (whilst also being heartbroken myself- for the third time..) i need to know if i’m being toyed around. He himself can’t tell me, he can’t see clearly right now.

,depression,"Their are 2 kinds of depression, a clinical one which you have no control over which is a chemical imbalance but is rare. The other is a self inflicted one, trust me when i say that your mind is trying to get you out of working hard and developing yourself which is otherwise known as depression as most know it today. What I'm saying is just fact but you won't believe me because you just have to experience these things and figure it out for yourself, sooner rather then later i hope.

Another thing i have found is that the generic “talk to someone” response you hear about online is what you %100 must do (with someone you trust most. srs if you dont want to talk to a parent then fucking dont, just someone you trust. A doctor is a good last resort if you have nobody which is also just fine)

When i was a little younger i didn't understand why but now i see that i was so naive (which is natural ofc) and their actually was a big problem in my life that i wasn't adressing.
It's sad because i personally missed out on a lot, not because of others even though i had every reason to blame them. It's actually because i was too weak to bite the bullet and do the emotionally difficult thing and seek help but rather hoping someone would come save me.

We both moved to Texas 12 months ago, completely away from all friends and family, for work. And it has been a long and depressing year. Being away from her loved ones has effected her so much more than we could have imagined. So today she is leaving to go back home and heal. Her mom and brother are landing at the airport now to help her drive back to Washington. 

This isn’t a goodbye, it’s the start of a new chapter that will include much needed healing so we can move on from here and be so much happier together. But there is no time frame, obviously we don’t know how long she’s gonna need. I really am truly proud of her for doing this and In no way do I actually not want her to go. 

But the thought of being alone in our house all day, with literally zero friends or family that even live in this state is absolutely killing me. I’m terrified. I’m so scared of everything right now. I love her more than anything in this world, and I know she loves me just as much. But I can’t help being extremely scared right now. I have cried more today than I think I have the last 10 years combined. 

It probably sounds selfish, but I’m so scared she’s gonna go back home and become complacent. That she isn’t going to want to come back. I’m trembling at the thought of this morning being the last time I get to wake up beside her in bed. 

She is my best friend and I just don’t know what to do without her. And I will admit that is part of the healing process and part of the problem we face. We rely on each other for literally everything. It’s not healthy to have to think of another person before you make any kind of decision about whatever it may be. 

I truly do from the bottom of my heart know that we can get better. We can better ourselves and in turn better our relationship. Neither of us want this to be the end, not even close. We’ve both done soooo much good for each other. But nonetheless I can’t help but be scared and feel like I’m stuck in a pit that I can’t get out of.

I can’t eat even though I’m hungry, I can’t find joy in anything around the house because I want to be able to enjoy it with her.

,depression,"*Note: I’m not diagnosed with depression. I’m just generally pretty apathetic about my own wellbeing and the world around me, and I’m also beating myself up for my mistakes. Also I’m an ungrateful, self-disliking, lazy, terrible person being a crybaby and throwing a tantrum about why I can’t always do what I want. Urgh, whatever.* 

I didn’t read it.

I just broke down, cried, hid the letter, tore up a piece of tissue paper pretending that it was the letter but it wasn’t so that I could stop crying more. The symbolism kinda worked.

I know it was nice because it was from a church acquaintance (let’s call her Riley). I used to go to a church group with Riley and other people with my age (I’m 19). We’d go to church together, listen to the Pastor saying God loves us or some shit, then we’d hang out until night to eat dinner together. Dilly-dally, talk and walk for a little bit. Maybe talk about the bible sometimes but not all the time. She was in that friendly church group, someplace where there isn’t really judgement. A place where everyone in it was assumed to be a friend.

I low-key quit that group because I thought a very close friend (let’s call her Sandy) had left me behind a few months back. Because I didn’t see Sandy for months and she wasn’t responding at all to much of my texts (which weren’t a lot tbh); even though that was our only mode of communication. So by association, I couldn’t trust surface-level friends either. The friendship were tiring and slow to grow and maintain. So I didn’t trust that group who called me a friend for no reason other than the fact I just happened to be there. Why should I? I couldn’t hang out with them on any other day other than church days. I bet most of them wouldn’t miss me, heck I wouldn’t, I don’t expect them to and I don’t want them to.

Then, Sandy and I made up. She was just going her own emotional problem stuff and was shutting out the world. She wasn’t telling me. I understand why, I’m in her place now. I’m just embarrassed by myself and my feelings and I don’t want her to know.

By then, it was assumed that I had already left the group, so I still didn’t go back to it. Why bother? Nothing fucking matters. Did I mention that I’m a bit of a nihilist so that I can build a wall of apathy around me and have nothing hurt me anymore? Sometimes it works and sometimes it doesn’t. It does succeed into making me look like an inconsiderate asshole sometimes tho! :D

Fuck.

Then Riley sent the letter to likely check up on me, in a more meaningful way than a text.

I don’t know why she cares. No one should be caring about me.

I understand why my family cares about me, they’re family and I show that I (sometimes) care about them. Also make them laugh sometimes.

I understand why Sandy and my second best friend care about me, they’re like my sworn family, the sisters I never had.

I understand why over the years, my past teachers and school-counsellor cared about me. It’s their job.

But I don’t understand Riley and her letter, this show of caring. I don’t get it. I don’t want it.  
 

No one should be caring about me I don’t deserve any of that.

It triggered some hurt for some reason, maybe it’s the self-loathing.

I wish I gave her a wrong address.

I’m sorry about complaining. It’s supposed to be a good thing.

I’m sorry. I know that I’m blessed and lucky to have people care about me.

,depression,"I'm not going to try again, but nobody I know truly gets it. I doubt even you guys do

Sure, I used to lurk here years ago and see myself in most of the posts, but since then I have gotten formally diagnosed with depression and sought professional help with aid from my parents ~~because I was too pathetic to do any of the heavy work myself at that point in time.~~ I worked on finishing 2 full meals a day so I could gain weight, went out for walks, had school and library visits to look forward to, started medication, stopped lurking on subs like these, leaned on my dad when times got rough, found an unexpected joy in cooking, and combated my perpetual exhaustion by napping as often as possible. (Unfortunately, I learned the exhaustion's usually spiritual.)

The past two years have been very good for me and 2020 was going to be even better.

Pre-April, I was burying myself in my interests while on track to high school graduation (albeit a late one) and I was working out 5 days out of 7. Now? I've been languishing because I've been stuck *for ages* in the exact type of situation my therapist warned me to avoid. With no school to structure my schedule around after they were all shut down, or friends I can bring myself to physically hang out with given the circumstances, or access to gyms or therapy even before everything went to shit, and plenty of assaults and rioting in my home country I've regressed to a bitter shell of my best self.

I have veganism forcing me up in the mornings and current events here have pushed me to stop being so shy about activism in general (especially when it comes to the police brutality plaguing the country) so I'm going to be attending a protest set in two days from now if I can find a friend to bring, but beyond that my life and routine are stuck in limbo.

I didn't do it for the uncomfortable and empty reach-outs and platitudes I ended up getting. I did it because it hurts to exist when I've had a taste of how great life can be.

I checked the scale and saw I was 110 now which isnt too big of a deal. Over the course of the last few months now, my weight has still continued to plumit. When I came back home from spring break I was 107... Now that I have moved back home, finished freshman year, and work two jobs, I checked again to find I weigh a measily 97 pounds. Truely I am very alarmed. You may be asking, what is my relation to food? Before, I would eat like an normal happy person, indulging in snacks and eating my meals. With college, work, and depression, food really leaves my mind. Others with depression a lot of the time reaide in food but thats not me. A lot of the time food is a pleasure only obtainable if all work is done (my mentality was to finish my homework first THEN eat, or go to work FIRST then maybe eat). A lot of the time the pain of being hungry felt SO much better than the pain from depression, which is why not eating felt good to me. Now that I have lost so much and have done research to know that I am medically underweight terrifies me. I am doing better mentally, but I am still struggling to remember that I do need to eat. I don’t punish myself by starving anymore but I think my body has gotten so used to going hungry for so long its forgotten how to tell me when I am hungry. My question to anybody reading this is has anyone gone through anything similar? Most importantly, how did you over come this?

—————————

For all of you, us. I’ve lived a lifetime in my castle, and sometimes it is only moments. 

It’s a place too many of us in 
r/depression 
and 
r/alone 
know too well. 

The stories I could tell. 

The hotlines are good, or the one I’ve called (RAINN) is. In moments of desperation, it is... not sure how to complete that sentence. Do you?

I’m here people, with you. I can tell you I get it, but the reality is that my moment is mine, and your moment is yours. They are different but the same. 

“Castle” is an adaptation from the “Queen’s castle”, which I wrote for another. 

This I piece together from us. Therefore it is for you, for me. From all I read here, from a lifetime in my castle. 

The riddle doesn’t have to be about the meaning of life. There are so many doors into the room, but once inside the room there seems to be no way out. 

I can only tell you what I’ve learned over time. I have learned that life is worth living, but the only way to find out is to live. The first step to living is choosing to live. We have lost to many. Stay with us, please. 

The philosopher who had the biggest impact on me in my life is David Foster Wallace. He wrote a short book titled, “This is water.” He doesn’t tell us the answer to the riddle. He tells us that we get to choose how we think. He told us this from experience, because he too had a Castle. 

To the Kings and Queens.

We lay in bed and we talk about things to avoid her anxiety, and usually around 9 or 10pm she is too tired for sexy times which by no means is a problem, I just miss it so much. I want her to be better, I want her to be happy and I feel helpless. She takes effexor for depression and buspar for anxiety and I suppose the prospect of losing her father is taking over her thoughts. But I am being as gentle as possible, laying with her and making her laugh. But late at night I worry about her, I know she won&amp;#39;t do anything drastic but I just want to see her smiling face.&lt;/p&gt;

,depression,"Hey, am a 16 yearold guy and I'm lost.

To save peoples time from reading everything I wrote, just... what is this empty feeling, where no matter what you do, you just dont feel happy.. as if you're empty or plain, things you loved doing simply doesn't work. Drowning myself in friends and distractions dont work either, I'm confused school never taught me about this or depression,.

If anyone can help, please, I'll accept anything.

I can write a background story if it makes more sense, or needed... but I've never felt this way, it's terrible fuck..

I feel nothing, nothing is enjoyable to me anymore.

Friends, girlfriend, games, hobbies, usual activities ALL of that is meaningless to me. I dont care anymore this world is just... not enjoyable.


See I dont think of suicide or self harm, I dont even feel sad I just simply no longer feel like life is enjoyable.

I sit and watch my friends have a good time, my family spending time together and smiling, over things that are funny or sweet... but to me, its meaningless.

Do I have depression, what is this feeling of eternal emptiness, I cant stay angry at anyone.. my own girlfriend broke up with me for her old ex because I wasn't the same, and she later told me she cheated with me with a guy who I had doubts about a few months prior... and in that moment I was okay, I didnt care...

I didnt feel sad, or angry... just plain.



If I could describe this feeling, it's a flat feeling.. of boredom, nothing is able to fill it, I've tried everything at this point.. I pretended to like these girls I knew, messed around with plenty of them, and even resorted to using several heavy drugs in HOPE that maybe I'd kickstart my emotions in order...

No, they did nothing, the drugs my parents were addicted that made them soooo happy, did nothing for me.. no matter how much I took of them, or how shitty I felt when I had to come down and stop.
(For note, I'm not addicted, I dont care about drugs, they didn't work)


I've never went to the doctor's for depression simply because it's been going on for so long that I just blocked it away, no body would ever think I had depression.. I cant tell them.. how would I? The guy everyone comes to when they feel as if they hit rock bottom, that they ""fucked""up for good, no...


Man it was so easy to laugh and pretend I had fun, fuck.. I loved seeing my friends laugh and smile, they were experiencing something I wish I could feel, I wish I could be the kid from grade 9 who only watched anime and jacked off for enjoyment, yet now all I do is sit and listen to music to fend off the feeling if boredom and the quietness.

My grades haven't dropped, I've maintained my 80s-85avg in school, nothing about me is struggling.. it could be my parents who are addicts that are hurting me, but I just dont feel like it is, I'm not sure what the fuck this is.. and I cant go to any of my friends or family for support, I live in a life of lies to protect the ones I cared about.. that's the one thing 






I'm sorry, I dont want to waste anyone's time with a long message, honestly man.... I wish other people never felt this feeling, I hope all of you can overcome it because holy shit it hurts man, it hurts so much to lie everyday to my friends and family and pretend as if everything is fine just to make sure they're okay, to lie to break off close relationships so that my friends are fine, I never want to be a burden, I've always been the guy everyone went to for advice, my smile... laughs, I was such a weird funny guy, always doing stupid shit that sacrificed my own reputation JUST to make my classmates laugh, I liked helping others.",t2_6eapi1dm,False,,0,False,"I'm lost, what am I doing...",[],r/depression,False,0,,0,,False,t3_h7ijvv,False,dark,0.67,,public,1,0,{},,False,[],,False,False,,{},,False,1,,False,,False,,[],{},,True,,1591988072.0,text,0,,,text,self.depression,False,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hey, am a 16 yearold guy and I&amp;#39;m lost.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I can write a background story if it makes more sense, or needed... but I&amp;#39;ve never felt this way, it&amp;#39;s terrible fuck..&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I feel nothing, nothing is enjoyable to me anymore.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Friends, girlfriend, games, hobbies, usual activities ALL of that is meaningless to me. I dont care anymore this world is just... not enjoyable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;See I dont think of suicide or self harm, I dont even feel sad I just simply no longer feel like life is enjoyable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I sit and watch my friends have a good time, my family spending time together and smiling, over things that are funny or sweet... but to me, its meaningless.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Do I have depression, what is this feeling of eternal emptiness, I cant stay angry at anyone.. my own girlfriend broke up with me for her old ex because I wasn&amp;#39;t the same, and she later told me she cheated with me with a guy who I had doubts about a few months prior... and in that moment I was okay, I didnt care...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I didnt feel sad, or angry... just plain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If I could describe this feeling, it&amp;#39;s a flat feeling.. of boredom, nothing is able to fill it, I&amp;#39;ve tried everything at this point.. I pretended to like these girls I knew, messed around with plenty of them, and even resorted to using several heavy drugs in HOPE that maybe I&amp;#39;d kickstart my emotions in order...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No, they did nothing, the drugs my parents were addicted that made them soooo happy, did nothing for me.. no matter how much I took of them, or how shitty I felt when I had to come down and stop.
(For note, I&amp;#39;m not addicted, I dont care about drugs, they didn&amp;#39;t work)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve never went to the doctor&amp;#39;s for depression simply because it&amp;#39;s been going on for so long that I just blocked it away, no body would ever think I had depression.. I cant tell them.. how would I? The guy everyone comes to when they feel as if they hit rock bottom, that they &amp;quot;fucked&amp;quot;up for good, no...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Man it was so easy to laugh and pretend I had fun, fuck.. I loved seeing my friends laugh and smile, they were experiencing something I wish I could feel, I wish I could be the kid from grade 9 who only watched anime and jacked off for enjoyment, yet now all I do is sit and listen to music to fend off the feeling if boredom and the quietness.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My grades haven&amp;#39;t dropped, I&amp;#39;ve maintained my 80s-85avg in school, nothing about me is struggling.. it could be my parents who are addicts that are hurting me, but I just dont feel like it is, I&amp;#39;m not sure what the fuck this is.. and I cant go to any of my friends or family for support, I live in a life of lies to protect the ones I cared about.. that&amp;#39;s the one thing &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m sorry, I dont want to waste anyone&amp;#39;s time with a long message, honestly man.... I wish other people never felt this feeling, I hope all of you can overcome it because holy shit it hurts man, it hurts so much to lie everyday to my friends and family and pretend as if everything is fine just to make sure they&amp;#39;re okay, to lie to break off close relationships so that my friends are fine, I never want to be a burden, I&amp;#39;ve always been the guy everyone went to for advice, my smile... laughs, I was such a weird funny guy, always doing stupid shit that sacrificed my own reputation JUST to make my classmates laugh, I liked helping others.&lt;/p&gt;

,depression," Hi I am 39 years old I am tired of living through life like this I'm on disability the unable to work because of PTSD severe chronic depression severe social anxiety which makes working nearly impossible to be around others and just to be able to try to do a job I also have dyslexia and learning issues which make working even harder especially if it's something I've never done before. Companies don’t want someone who is really slow at trying to learn and who has no education.

I have a tooth that needs to be recrowned and its the #19 tooth, I had the #30 tooth same spot on the right side removed and if I get #19 removed, I won't be able to chew as it is the only tooth I have I can really chomp down on food and yet I can't afford the $1200 for a new crown on it so I have no option but to get it removed for $400 

I have spent show years trying to get my GED, and I have spent many years trying to get a job my own place a vehicle and a good woman to love me. I have lost my parents when I was in my early twenties I only knew my dad for a few months before he passed away when I was 23, when I was 25 I lost my mother I don't know if it was from suicide or if it was from health issues.

I have no family no friends, what can we do have they don't want anything to do with me or I don't want anything to do with them because of how toxic they are to me. I have spent many years homeless and have been through a lot of stuff and seeing things nobody should see. I am currently renting a room from a sixty-year-old woman and if she dies I will end up back on the streets.

I have been trying to find a place to live I've been called up for several apartments low income, but every time it comes time for me to take one something comes up that keeps me from being able to get into one. I bought a car a few years ago and got scammed out of $2,000 to USD. I've been trying to save for another car but every time I do something comes up that takes my savings  or pushes me further in debt.

For the past 10 years I have applied for jobs never had an interview, I have spent trying to get my GED  and have been unable to. I've had tutors I've had teachers,  I have had study groups and one-on-one sessions. but even with all of this I have not been able to get my GED my education is on a second and third-grade level in almost every subject and I have to learn from 2nd grade to 12th grade I can't do that.

I spend my time watching movies, TV shows, listening to music, I don't even have a game system so I can't even play video games which I actually used to enjoy doing. It's been years since I've played a video game I can't afford the consoles or the games. and the computer I have is not strong enough to be able to hold video games or to be able to handle playing video games.

I used to enjoy fishing camping used to enjoy archery, I even used to go bowling every other Friday night which I can't do anymore either. I even used to love going to the golf courses and hitting up the golf ranges and just shooting a bucket of golf balls I found it peaceful and relaxing but I can't even afford that. 

I have done many things for work which was cash under the table and it was all manual labor. I have done everything from fixing fences building concrete slabs building porches building staircases as well as building walls and fixing holes in the walls even putting in new flooring or replacing flooring. I have done many other things as well as boxing for a few months I drove a semi-truck for a few months but my anxiety gets so bad to the point I could even drive them anymore. I can't do the work I used to do because of arthritis in my lower back and rheumatoid arthritis in my knees and feet.

I consider myself weird and nerdy by I consider myself a homebody but I do like going out time to time that prefers to stay home. I have put myself out there in the dating scene for over 8 years, during those eight years I've had women catfish me pretending to want to be with me, leading me on as they loved me. then they would fake their death on me or they would just ghost me. I have had women telling me I was a joke worthless useless had nothing to offer a relationship and I shouldn't even be loved and no one would want to be with me.

I have been trying to build myself a life and been trying to get on my feet but every time I do things come up that keep me down and knock me back down and I just can't keep doing it anymore. it feels like every breath I take is just razors cutting through my lungs attracting me apart inside. I am tired of struggling to breathe. I am tired of trying to fight to build something out of my life. I am tired of spending every waking moment of my life alone single unloved unwanted.

All I wanted was to find a woman to love me and accept me and treat me right. I don't ask for much just a simple life, all I want is just one or two friends a nice woman my own apartment and a vehicle that's it. but it feels like I'm trying to reach to live on Pluto and it's like it's trying to ask for a billion dollars and to become the president of the whole world.

I am tired I am worn out I am exhausted I have nothing left in me to give nothing left in me to fight I can't do it by myself anymore alone no support no one helping me constantly fighting and fighting and getting nowhere except right where I was when I started to try to fight to build something I can't do it anymore so today when a woman that I rent bedroom from leaves I will end up ending my life.

My parents always wanted 3 kids and after my sister was born, they had a baby named Britney but she died while she was growing in the womb. Then came my older brother and me. If she didn't died in the womb, then I wouldn't be here and become a burden on everyone. I have dreams to better my life and making it big one day and becoming rich, but the problem is that I am a baby boy, lazy, unmotivated, and a ""bitch"" according to my sister's asshole fiance. Since 2009, my life been shit. I attempted suicide because I feel everyone hated me and nobody cared about me. Transferred at the beginning of 7th grade where I didn't connect with the people and I wanted to be popular, so I said shit in order to be cool. Hung aroung fake people while the people who seem to like me (including 5 girls to be exact) were ignored by me. Then my mom died in 2013 and my life hasn't been the same. I went to high school and it fucked me up in plenty of ways, although I discovered new music and a video game that pretty much kept me alive. In high school, I fell in love but long story short, she rejected me and I was obsessed with her, even though she had a boyfriend and when everybody was telling me to leave her alone, I didn't. Thankfully, I ended my friendship with her but I did it in a stupid way because she had sex with her boyfriend. And she told me that I made her life in high school a living hell. It was my fault, I didn't see what I was doing to her at the time because I was selfish and only cared about what she was doing to me. Anyway, my OCD Contamination took a turn for the worse and it still affects me to this day. I was in the bathroom for 2 hours and washing alot. Things seem to be better in 2017 until it was 2018 and that was a shitty year. I was acting up in community college and got kicked out of a class for interrupting lectures in African American Studies by asking questions and asking dumb questions (my fault), I liked a girl and we got together but she really didn't like me. She was a poor gf and basically used me for attention. She never came to my house because she didnt like the neighorhood. We made out and she said that I hurt her, despite I asked before doing anything and she always said ""yes"". And then my dumbass hooked up with a guy with no protection and that fucks me up to this day. I was taking medication for my OCD and I stopped afterward to get on PEP and not get HIV (the test came back negative, thankfully). I also cut many of my ""friends"" off, although I ruined like one friendship because she wasn't into me and she had a bf. I don't know why I thought that was okay at the time but moving on. Another girl I liked didn't want to hang out with me just to find out that she was pregnant later that year, although she told me that she didn't want a relationship in the summer of that year. And now, I screwed up some opportunites to intern or be in a mentorship program because I didn't submit the required things in time or I was too late to respond. My dad always call me a screwball because I screw things up. I guess he is right. I hope I die soon although I don't want to die. Me dying is for the best anyway. I dont want to kill myself but I just want all this to end. If I known my life was gonna be like this, I would chose to be an animal or a object instead. Better yet, another person. I always wonder why would life take my mom away from me instead of me? Its clear that im not shit and im a burden on people. My mom was a great person, lovely, and a popular person who loved a good time. It will alwaya be fuck life as long as i live. If i dont die by 2023, I swear, im gonna kill myself or something.

The owner said it's so I can realize my potential &amp; do more artistic things with my skillset, but I really loved my responsibilities getting people in to see their therapists when they needed to. I was the front office manager at a Psychological practice with a dozen providers, &amp; I scheduled appointments &amp; made sure everyone had all the copies/paperwork they needed &amp; stocked our supply cabinets &amp; also as a side job cleaned the whole office building on the weekends. 

I'd never held a job for half a decade before. It was my favorite one I'd ever had &amp; by far the most rewarding. My life is about to be so different &amp; I'm trying not to be sad &amp; see it as an opportunity instead of grieving the loss of what I thought would be my career for quite a while.

,depression,"Hello everyone,



I'm 25 right now and tbh, I just live from day to day. I don't really have goals, I barely have anything that sparks a fire in me.



I always had dreams of being respected, loved, admired and all that stuff.

Because my real life was not like this, I lost myself in fantasies, addictions and anger.



Sometimes it's incredibly difficult for me to just accept the point where I'm at, because I get so overwhelmed by self-loathing and constant questions like ""why does everyone experience love and sexuality and you're still a virgin?"", ""even if you do sports and do something about you, what does it even gonna change? You're still the same person, so perhaps she or girl x just doesn't like you that much""  and all of that.





There's a girl I really like, she has a boyfriend but I felt we always had a good vibe and also decided that we wanted to hangout together.

But sometimes I feel like this interest is just on my side. I mean, she likes my post and she is kind and everything, but it's not like a real friendship or a real contact and it makes me freaking sad, because the idea that she might not be part of my life honestly makes me really suicidal right now.





I know it's stupid to focus your entire life on one girl, and people tell me there are other girls, but I want her.

I have never met a girl in my life before that I think I liked that much, when I think about her I could cry because I don't know what to do.




Sometimes I would just love to send her a text that I love her and I wanna be with her, but I'm afraid that might ruin everything.



But the worst is that I always assumed to be in her friendzone, now I'm not even sure about that.
We text occasionally but I feel like the main interest in that comes from my side. And sometimes she doesn't even reply or it takes some time. Which makes me question how important I am to her.




The thought about not being a part of her life or her not being part of mine drives me insane.


I feel like whatever I do, I come second and I'll never get what I desire so much. I often feel like I will never be the guy that I want to be, which is why I hesitate to actually change anything.


Because I don't have the guarantee that it will work out.
Sometimes I feel like I could become the absolute best version of myself, what would it serve if she's still not interested?



I know I'm just surrendering to my emotions and wish-thinking right now, but that's just how it is..:(




The closer I get to 27 and the more I think about my boring and depressing life, the more I feel like I just wanna leave this world with a message for her and for the people that cared for me.



I don't wanna die really, but I can't deal with the feeling anymore of not being enough. Of feeling insecure.
I'm sick and tired of feeling anxious, sad, lost, hopeless.




All my life I've been searching but even if I find what seems to be the right place to stay, it's not mine.

Nothing is in fact mine. Everything is just there to collapse again.

I feel like whatever I want, I'm never enough just by nature.


There's always something you gotta do. Tbh, the main reason why I wanna do sports is to get this girl (or if it doesn't work out, other girls). I'm sick of being the guy that is always a bit off, always introverted and insecure. I hate life for being a rollercoaster.


People tell me ""don't worry, you'll find the right one"". But I think she is the right one. And even if she's not, I still want to make the experience somehow.



I finally want to be part of THAT life, the life that almost every normal person seems to experience. I know myself and I know how often my mood just collapses and I fall back into old patterns.



I have no reason to fight if I don't know that it will work out.

At this point, I just want out. I just want a good life. I just want to be the one that gets to be with her. The hero of the story.

But the older I get, the more I feel like I'm just a background actor, the guy that plays a small role in other people's life.




Perhaps enough to be a friend, never enough to be more than that.


Seriously, I'm so sick of it all... All the time passing by and I'm getting older and older and I'm still waiting for a better life to come. It will never come until I change something.

Some days I can kind of feel them coming on because I'm irritated, there's thoughts and I'm kinda agitated, that's usually followed by an episode of really intense depression with crying, being absolutely upset, not being able to think clearly, high tension/stress, fast heart rate, suicidal ideation… I've always compared it to a thunderstorm in my head. Then maybe an hour or two later it's just over from one minute to the next and I'm not able to understand what was going through my own head just a few minutes before and why I was so upset. I was never able to pin those phases to any specific situation or things currently going on in my life, although I briefly thought they were related to migraine. When those phases are over I always suddenly feel very calm, very hungry and I have a headache

I took medication to treat my ADHD that I've been diagnosed with for almost 8 years and I quit with 15. Just in time for the weed to be my alternative.

I experienced heavy domestic abuse, my father tried to kill me and later he left. After he left, I lived with my mother and the guy and the guy after that and the guy after that  in like 5 years. 2 of them where abusive aswell. When I was 7 I moved to my grandma1 then the medication started. Grandma1 has experienced heavy child traumas and couldn't show any affection. She treated me like garbage and we lived like garbage so I really felt like garbage. Everytime I would get a bad grade in primary school I was so fucking embarrassed that I started to just not tell her.

,depression,"Every day that passes I hope is my last. I know that's a horrible thing to say but over the last while it's how I've been feeling, I look up to my ceiling and wonder how I'd look hanging from my roof.

A lot of it stems from loneliness. I'm at university, so I went in expecting to find my best friends there, and while yes there's a general group of friends I fell in with, I'm not as close with any of them as they are with other people in our group, for instance over this lockdown period I don't think any of them have actually wanted to keep talking to me one-on-one other than sending me a meme every other week or just using me for answers for any work that the uni have sent out. I don't think I've made any truly close friends at university that I can call my 'best friends', just that im part of a group, and don't get me wrong there's nothing wrong with the people in it at all they're great folks, it's just that there are people all of them have that they can rely on within the group and I don't have that, and there have been a number of times over the semesters where I have broke down because I genuinely had nobody in my life I considered a close friend.

A lot of it stems from my physical health too. I played football since I was 5 for my local team and it was great to play all through underage level. Although after I left U18 I have not played a full year of football, I've had hip injuries, hamstring injuries, back injuries to name a few, but most recently I had a major surgery on my arm, which is another long story I have had ongoing issues with for 10+ years and had numerous surgeries on before, it seemed like this one recently would be the one to fix all the issues I've had from it. With the problems the surgery fixed it has created more, which results in the arm being painful everyday, even to this day, meaning I can't do a lot more things than I could before. I was in a cast for more than 2 months, I'm still having physio from 2 physiotherapists, I can't do anything that puts the slightest amount of pressure on my arm and I have started to question whether or not this surgery was worth it, due to the fact that if I hadn't had the operation nothing would have changed and, instead of being exiled from the team because I haven't been able to train for nearly a year, I would have been part of the squad like normal, and I wouldn't be having these issues where my anxiety about going back and feeling like I don't belong to that group of lads is through the roof. I'm so scared to go back because I just don't feel worthy to be there due to the fact that I haven't been there all year and I will be judged for something that I couldn't control the outcome of.

I dunno whether anyone would be able to help me after this rant, and I know all this is so so much of a bullshit reason to be so depressed and miserable, but something happened over the last week in my brain that looked at things and genuinely thought about wrapping them around my neck and   hanging myself, and over the last few days especially I haven't been able to sleep, I've been shouting at random times out of sheer anxiety, it's gotten to the stage where I genuinely think I'm going to do something that will hurt my family and I would like some help if anyone can",t2_5aw1btu8,False,,0,False,Suicidal,[],r/depression,False,0,,0,,False,t3_h79dmm,False,dark,1.0,,public,5,0,{},,False,[],,False,False,,{},,False,5,,False,,False,,[],{},,True,,1591947499.0,text,0,,,text,self.depression,False,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Every day that passes I hope is my last.

,depression,"I never post things on any kind of website really, but right now to better myself I think I need to say something. Since elementary school till now I’ve felt like I’ve been ghost. Drifting in a desert full of potentially wonderful people living there lives, without knowing how to connect theirs to mine. I’ve been having to deal with depression since I was 12 and believe it’s because of this. 

Eight months ago I think this came to a crux, setting off a wave of panic attacks I’ve only started to fix now. Despite pushing to better myself it feels like fate keeps slamming my fingers to throw me back into void I’ve spent most my life in. At late 19 after a bunch of good therapy and well working medication, I was finally getting enough energy to do stuff again. However this was short-lived. Due to the sudden drop of my old medication, five days later I had a massive migraine which seemingly only lasted a day. Unfortunately lasting side effects occurred leaving My eyes too sensitive to do anything for around nine months. I was basically bedridden. 

It felt like all those years were thrown away for a new hell. Despite the new depression medication, being in your room for that long gets to your head. I started feeling down again. But I managed to get through it with patience and yet another medication change (yay). So at the start of summer vacation with migraines fixed and my depression being handled I was finally doing something again. It was just one small online class but it was something! I was proud of that. The hardest part of my life seemed to be over. :D

Two weeks later I was in the emergency room. I had my first panic attack on the way to a concert I said I would go to with my twin and his friends. Despite being told that anxiety and depression go hand-in-hand, I innocently dismissed this, thinking I had it a bit different because I’ve never felt much anxiety before. Turns out I was just REALLY good at bottling it up over the years. But a bottles got to pop, and boy did it pop. 
For the first two months, anxiety so bad I couldn’t drive for more than a minute or else I would get a full on panic attack causing me to barely breathe then leading to me actually crying, for fear of passing out and crashing. For the first three months anxiety so bad a normal breathe that wasn’t shallow was a godsend. Mini panic attacks that made me feel complete dissociation with the world(not fun). And to top it off a second trip to the hospital, because my awful anxiety amplified a migraine leaving half my body slightly numb. A little numbness is usual for migraines but this was different. (I thought I was having a stroke haha.)

I’m going to honest, this completely broke me. I’m so tired.
Although right now I am grateful that my anxiety has been warded off mostly. I’ve recently assessed my situation, and after looking back up for the first time in a while it seems like emotionally I’m back in a hole... At least it’s a different one eh? 

The reason why I’m saying all this is because I figured out most of this is caused by my loneliness. In middle school when I started feeling depressed the only friends I had were my brothers friends. I would hang out with them at lunch time, but that’s about it. Although that seemed to keep my loneliness at bay. 
My depression became clinical in the first months of high school. This is also when my brothers friend group split and went separate ways leaving me truly alone for the first time. After lots of reflection over the years, I now know that my depression becoming clinical was not as random as it seemed. 

Then we come to the panic attack. Simply put my loneliness just came to a head. Me and subconscious couldn’t deny my reality anymore. Being in a small car with people who weren’t my  friends driving to a concert where I knew I was just going to feel alone in a crowd was the tipping point I guess.

Don’t want to jinx it, but I think I’m climbing back up again. I feel so incredibly behind on everything, yet after all this emotional pain I feel like I’ve lived a lifetime. I’m so young yet I feel like the only energy I have left is to sit in the sand and enjoy other people doing there thing. But I guess I’ve always been doing that. 

Oh well, despite this strange feeling of self entropy I’ll carry on. 
Cas f**k it!

Which is cool, but she has no evidence, she just points to a disaster and says ""The bad Bob did that"" and idk thats not sayin much.

I just gotta remember on how dismissive of my suicidal thoughts she was when explaining them or how she let our family cat die. If this ""good bob"" is so good, then why didn't he help the love of his life out of the shack she and ""his children"" were living in with the alcoholic dad who sleeps with whores weekly? Fuck, my brother was so badly bullied the only time he mentions it was when he's piss drunk, fuck, those kids stripped him naked one time. Bullying causes serious shit that affects people later on in life in big ways, so were was this ""good bob""? If he was so rich why didn't he help my brother or I when we were being bullied? Chasing off harpies? Yeah, thats mom's view of all young women.

She calls me dumb sometimes, but if she's so smart, then how does she:

-Keep falling for guys who treat her like shit

-Keep  making friends who later turn into shit

-Keep losing basic shit in her mountain of shit(shes a hoarder)

-Let the family cat die when we had the choice of bringing him to our new home

-Have kids when she just lives in a shack with wheels(runned down rv)

-Proceed to poorly raise the youngest(aka her successor to the universe, aka me) to the point were they have no ability to handle basic responsibilities

-Not cut family that is toxic to her out of her life sooner

-Not remember names of places or people and remember where they are or who they are

,depression,"So in the past sixth months the following things have happened. I’m a 32 year old male. (For context I was abused mentally and physically as a child/teen by both my father and stepfather and have struggled with anxiety most of my life. Now I fear depression)
1. My grandmother who was the most important person in my life finally lost her battle with cancer. I’m devastated but I’ve had to basically hold everything together and take care of everything that needed to happen like funeral arrangements etc. I feel like I haven’t had tune to mourn. 
2. My fathers alcoholism had finally caught up to him. He fell in a drunken accident and hurt his spine/neck. He laid on the floor for almost two days before someone found him. He lives alone. If he lives he will be at best a paraplegic. He is currently fighting off a body wide infection and withdrawal from the booze. He is in and out of consciousness. He has burned all the bridges in his life so I have been dealing with being his proxy even though we were very limited contact. He has no one else. 
3. I come from an extremely religious family. I have decided to not follow the religion anymore as of five years ago. I’ve been dating a woman for a little over a year and things are starting to change. My family won’t acknowledge her because I’m dating outside the religion. They barely speak to me anyway.

4. December of 2019 my business partner and I finally opened our business after a lot of time and money invested into getting things up and running. Things were going good and appearing to be promising. Then corona happened. We had to close for almost three months. We are back open now but I don’t know if the business is going to survive the hit we took in the three months we were closed. It halted our momentum. I’m afraid we will have to close. 
5. My girlfriend was just laid off from her job and she is freaking out about it. It has put a huge strain on our relationship and I’m trying to be supportive but I’m so low myself it’s hard to help her.  
6. My mother pretty much blames everything bad that has happened to me on me leaving the religion.

I’m a 32 year old male. (For context I was abused mentally and physically as a child/teen by both my father and stepfather and have struggled with anxiety most of my life. Now I fear depression)
1. My grandmother who was the most important person in my life finally lost her battle with cancer. I’m devastated but I’ve had to basically hold everything together and take care of everything that needed to happen like funeral arrangements etc. I feel like I haven’t had tune to mourn. 
2. My fathers alcoholism had finally caught up to him. He fell in a drunken accident and hurt his spine/neck. He laid on the floor for almost two days before someone found him. He lives alone. If he lives he will be at best a paraplegic. He is currently fighting off a body wide infection and withdrawal from the booze. He is in and out of consciousness. He has burned all the bridges in his life so I have been dealing with being his proxy even though we were very limited contact. He has no one else. 
3. I come from an extremely religious family. I have decided to not follow the religion anymore as of five years ago. I’ve been dating a woman for a little over a year and things are starting to change. My family won’t acknowledge her because I’m dating outside the religion. They barely speak to me anyway. Her family struggles with accepting me because I have such a different background and upbringing and have had trouble adjusting to their perspective and points of view.

,depression,"I've been using it for more than 13 years (of depression) as a way to access my fantasy world/escape mechanism. Now that I'm trying to be more present with my uncomfortable reality, I feel like I will have to delete all of my music in order to avoid the temptation to relapse. It does feel like an addiciton, I don't know if it would be more helpfuld than damaging.

It would be a big deal for me since I have been obsessed with music for so long, I've identified with it as my main interest and I have been able to play instruments intuitively with no training. I would have loved to create my own music as a form of self-expression, even if with little to no recognition, I would have been content. However, after many failed attempts at trying to create melodies (it's not that I can't create good ones, I can't create ANY), I decided it's pointless to pursue other musical skills since what matters to me most is the melody. After accepting the reality that I'm not like my favorite artists who, regardless of musical background, the melodies flow to them easily, I'm left being only a music aficionado, which is something that I have convinced myself for so long that it is not enough.

The momentary good experience I get from listening to my favorite music quickly gets overshadowed by the sadness of never being able to express myself in that way, or it will trigger my over-sensitivity which can leave me non-functional for weeks. The only way to bypass it is, while listening to the music, to enter a fantasy world in which I COULD make music. That has been my escape mechanism for 13 years, it has become an instinct more than a habit, and I don't want to go on that way. I don't feel like I can't make the next step in recovery if this doesn't change.

Do y'all think it would be a good idea to ""burn bridges"" with my music, i.e. delete my music collection?

,depression,"Since I was little, my parents were extremely abusive. Physically, mentally, and even for a little while, sexually.

I always thought there was something wrong with me, but a year ago I realized how abusive my parents were.

I struggled to heal myself since a year ago. I tried so hard. But when you’re living with your abusers, it’s so damn hard.

I’m thirteen. This year I’m going into high school. I was assigned to this low ranking high school by boundary. I wanted to transfer to this very high ranked high school, and even better: this high school was where my best friend was going. We had shared many good memories together. I wanted to make more with her again. I had been so excited for it. No one told me that I couldn’t transfer unless I met a certain criteria, and I guess my school counselor didn’t know either. Now I can’t transfer. I thought I could get my life together with this.

I figured I would try and cheer myself up. I asked my mom if I could get a nose ring, to which she yelled at me and said no. I tried to bargain with her, and I wasn’t rude. I tried to bring up points because she said it was a bad thing to have nose piercings. In the end she just told me to be quiet and leave her alone.

I’ve been having a horrible week. My traumatic flashbacks and intrusive thoughts have been getting worse.

My mom has relentlessly complained about how short I am. I’m 5’1. She’s complained about how skinny I was. 

I’m so fucking angry.

One time I told my dad that I wanted to go to Harvard when I went off to college. He laughed at me and said “You’re joking, right?” I have so many more horrible stories, like my mom trying to stab me.

I wish I had a different family. I wish I had a dad who would support me and love me for who I was. I wish I had a mom who wouldn’t always try to change me and call me ugly and release her anger on me all the time. I wish I had good parents that I could talk to about my problems and feel secure and safe and happy.

Physically, mentally, and even for a little while, sexually.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I always thought there was something wrong with me, but a year ago I realized how abusive my parents were.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I struggled to heal myself since a year ago. I tried so hard. But when you’re living with your abusers, it’s so damn hard.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m thirteen. This year I’m going into high school. I was assigned to this low ranking high school by boundary. I wanted to transfer to this very high ranked high school, and even better: this high school was where my best friend was going. We had shared many good memories together. I wanted to make more with her again. I had been so excited for it. No one told me that I couldn’t transfer unless I met a certain criteria, and I guess my school counselor didn’t know either. Now I can’t transfer. I thought I could get my life together with this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I figured I would try and cheer myself up. I asked my mom if I could get a nose ring, to which she yelled at me and said no. I tried to bargain with her, and I wasn’t rude. I tried to bring up points because she said it was a bad thing to have nose piercings. In the end she just told me to be quiet and leave her alone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve been having a horrible week. My traumatic flashbacks and intrusive thoughts have been getting worse.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My mom has relentlessly complained about how short I am. I’m 5’1. She’s complained about how skinny I was. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m so fucking angry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One time I told my dad that I wanted to go to Harvard when I went off to college. He laughed at me and said “You’re joking, right?” I have so many more horrible stories, like my mom trying to stab me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I wish I had a different family. I wish I had a dad who would support me and love me for who I was. I wish I had a mom who wouldn’t always try to change me and call me ugly and release her anger on me all the time. I wish I had good parents that I could talk to about my problems and feel secure and safe and happy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I wish I’d stop thinking that I’m such a brat and have all this stuff in my room. I wish I could have a better life, I wish I wasn’t so fucking ugly. I wish something would go right for once in my life.&lt;/p&gt;

I was walking around with a cut up arm and tried to end my own life; this is when I realized something was wrong and I need help.

,depression,"I am F23. I have dealt with depression for as long as I can remember and had several suicide attempts along the way. I made this post hoping that someone would have some advice or suggestions that I hadn’t uncovered or thought of. I often times feel as though reality isn’t even real. Almost like I’m in a dream-state or out of touch with my physical self. My mind is constantly narrating my life and being very critical of everything I witness/experience. My intrusive thoughts and impulses truly scare me at times. I do a lot of things in order to try and combat my depression and intrusive thoughts/impulses. I wrote out a list below. Regardless of these attempts I still become easily overwhelmed by life and constantly live in fear, self-doubt, and self-loathing. I don’t understand how even though I’m doing all these things to help myself I’m still suffering so much mentally. 

Here’s the breakdown:
I have a healthy, happy marriage of 2 years. 
I have secure employment. 
I am debt free.
I have money in my savings.
I work out everyday.
I do yoga each evening.
I have practiced meditation on &amp; off over the last 2 years.
I get at least 7-8 hours of sleep each night. 
I journal frequently.
I rarely consume alcohol.
I don’t over caffeinate (less than 100mg per day) 
I rarely rarely experiment with drugs (MDMA/LSD)
I eat a healthy diet, low in sugar, &amp; low in processed foods. 
I have a therapist.
I practice gratitude (although it doesn’t always produce the feeling of being grateful)
I read self-help and try to implement what I’ve read.
I keep my space organized &amp; clean.
I make my bed each day.
I take 60 seconds in the shower with the cold water on in order to reduce my reactions to stressors.
I take a daily multivitamin.

,depression,"I don't know why I'm posting here exactly, but I think that it will help me get my words out into the world. So here's my story:

I developed depression, suicidal thoughts, and anxiety at the age of 12. I was heavily abused by mom's methhead ex, and have been told that he will kill me. Since then I a have a reoccurring nightmare of me slitting my wrists in the bathroom. I hear my mom screaming as her ex starts beating her to death, and I try to open the door. However, with all the blood loss I'm too weak and slowly die on the floor. I had this dream twice a week for about 6 years, but now it's about once a month. 

After my mom and her ex separated, I was 14 and confessed to my mom about my depression, and she said that I was a self centered liar who only wanted attention. I began to spiral out of control and developed frequent panic attacks. It was also at the time that I convinced myself that if my life by the time I'm 18 is even lower than I am now, I would kill myself. Throughout highschool I struggled with bulimia and anorexia. Days were a blur, but I knew I had to stick it out until I was 18. 

Birthday rolls around and things are actually looking up. I recently gained my first friend, and we just bought a house. I was hopeful for the first time in my life. However, about 2 months later shit hits the fan. I learn that I have to testify against my mom's ex in court, and I have a incident with my siblings where I was kicked out and forced to live in my car.

 I finally decided to try and take my life once and for all. I take a bottle of oxycodone that I had after getting a wisdom tooth removed and swallow them all. I began panicking and threw them all up. I cried on the ground for what felt like hours. 

That leads me to today. I'm just going through the motions, and have just finished my first year of college. I fixed the issues with my family, and now able to live back home.

,depression,"Hello, this is my first time posting on Reddit so If I break any rules with this post please let me know.  

I’m still a teenager and I guess you can say hormones have to do with a lot of what I’m going through, not that I yell at my parents or anything like that. I feel like I’m meant to be a support for someone , because I don’t think of myself as someone who’s important. I think I realized this a couple years back when no one really checked up on me. I realized that my emotions don’t matter when it comes to anyone else’s. I have tried venting to someone but it makes me feel like they see me differently now. Or I think they feel like they should give me some sort of “ special treatment “. Growing up I never had any “child hood friends” , not that I wasn’t social I was a very social kid . I would just move every year of my life up until middle school. So Everytime Im like In a group of friends I feel out of place, I feel lonely. But at the same time I don’t want to be alone I want to be distracted from myself. 

I lost my best friend , and I feel like I really don’t have anyone to really lean on. Deep down I’ve always wanted someone to hold me and let me cry on them without judgment, but I know that won’t happen. Some days I just think what’s up with this cruel world with that’s going on worldwide. My best friend was everything to me. I felt like they were the first person I really came close to feeling “love” with. Sure I’ve had girlfriends but “love” or a really deep sense of caring was never there . At school I don’t act depressed , I act “ normal “. I have a group of friends I’m close with and still with . Even then I still feel out of place. Sadness has always been in my heart for as long as I can remember. I don’t see myself in the future. I can’t imagine myself like I used to. I did have goals but no motivation to try to accomplish them. Right now I’m holding onto someone that I know will really hurt me in the long run but it’s what I’m “living” for I guess you could say. I’m pretty sure this person wants me for attention and will throw me out once they’re satisfied. I feel like I can’t show emotions to them because If I do I’m afraid they’ll stop talking to me. For example, I got mad at them today , but they got mad at me for being mad at them you know . So I felt like if I do show anything that would annoy them like that they would get fed up and let go of me. I’m trying so hard to hold onto them. But honestly it’s whatever. It sounds really weird because I’m not really showing context but I just don’t wanna reveal a lot you know. 

I have a job at a smoothie place ,I work like 6 hours everyday not much but it helps me focus on a task. I feel like an empty shell everyday. I sometimes wish I wasn’t born because dealing with everything is annoying. And I know people go through harder things each day and I’m irrelevant compared to them . And I am grateful for living in a house and being able to attend school. But I just wanted to write down a few Things to the internet because I find it easier like that.

I felt like they were the first person I really came close to feeling “love” with. Sure I’ve had girlfriends but “love” or a really deep sense of caring was never there . At school I don’t act depressed , I act “ normal “. I have a group of friends I’m close with and still with . Even then I still feel out of place. Sadness has always been in my heart for as long as I can remember. I don’t see myself in the future. I can’t imagine myself like I used to. I did have goals but no motivation to try to accomplish them. Right now I’m holding onto someone that I know will really hurt me in the long run but it’s what I’m “living” for I guess you could say. I’m pretty sure this person wants me for attention and will throw me out once they’re satisfied. I feel like I can’t show emotions to them because If I do I’m afraid they’ll stop talking to me. For example, I got mad at them today , but they got mad at me for being mad at them you know . So I felt like if I do show anything that would annoy them like that they would get fed up and let go of me. I’m trying so hard to hold onto them. But honestly it’s whatever. It sounds really weird because I’m not really showing context but I just don’t wanna reveal a lot you know. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have a job at a smoothie place ,I work like 6 hours everyday not much but it helps me focus on a task. I feel like an empty shell everyday. I sometimes wish I wasn’t born because dealing with everything is annoying. And I know people go through harder things each day and I’m irrelevant compared to them . And I am grateful for living in a house and being able to attend school. But I just wanted to write down a few Things to the internet because I find it easier like that. I’m sorry if I sounded like some dumbass high schooler . I just don’t really know what else to do haha.&lt;/p&gt;

,depression,"Every grudge I didn't hold made me feel confident in the moment, or at least it used to until i went years with zero short term or long term benefits to not holding any grudges. 

Every time I didn't snap back had all the disadvantages of snapping back anyway, both with that person and with others. 

Having a good work ethic has always carried all the disadvantages of having a terrible one, everywhere I've ever worked. 

Letting go of the past hasn't helped me at all.

Being willing to drop the old fashioned ""cuckoo barn"" stigma of a mental hospital, and deciding of my own accord to go to one, I explained how I was feeling to everyone involved, and I learned new lessons that did give me a sense of confidence in terms of reentering normal life, with new ways to ""accept"" any of the same BS. I took pride in times where I didn't get hit as hard by something as in the past. At least until I got dismissed from the new job I had gotten, despite all those lessons I'd learned at the mental hospital, despite not holding any grudges, despite not taking anyone's anger personally, despite all the lessons I had learned over the years at my old job about letting go of little things. 

None of my relationships feel ""real"" anymore, and my family is always at a loss for ideas when I try to ask them for advice. I never meet someone who has a friend, or a friend of a friend, or anyone down that endless chain, with any success stories. 

Things that I used to do as a hobby do not feel fun anymore without a way to show it to anybody. Even before the pandemic I tried to find in-person groups that were hobby based. They were always people who did it as a job, and they neither liked their job nor had a hobby outside of their job. So I turned to online forums and tried to post about what I have made, problems I'm having, or ones I HAD and already solved. Views and thumb ups staying in the single digits for months, and trying other hobbies or presenting them differently always had the same result. 

Trying again during the pandemic to find an online forum of (insert hobby here) feeling like ""oh, everyone will be online now being stuck at home with nothing else to do"" and finding them just as barren as they were before then. 

I guess if someone spends their entire ducking life tapping away at a keyboard or touch screen, the last thing they would want to do is use the very thing they never put down anyway to discuss even their most favorite thing in the world.

,depression,"       Nothing interests me anymore. I just spend my time booting up games playing them for five minutes realizing that they just dont interest me anymore and then close them and move on to the next game, repeat. I've lost interest in everything that used to make me happy. I just dont really know how to spend my day. I feel terrible, I'm malnourished and sleep deprived. I feel like I'm just doing the same things every day with no pay off in the end. 
       Life in general just feels like a fever dream. Is this all there is to life? Repetition, loneliness, depression, and self-hatred? No matter how many medications I take, no matter how many counseling sessions I go to, nothing changes. No difference, no one loves me, still depressed, I still hate myself. Sometimes I just want to escape this neverending nightmare. I suspect I will kill myself at some point. 
      Sometimes I think back to when I was a kid and all the dreams and aspirations I had for my future back then. It breaks my heart to know that I failed at so many of those things. I wish I would have been a better person. I wish I could have accomplished so much more. I wish I had someone to share all my love with :(

  It just hurts so much.

,depression,"Hi! Treatment-resistant depression going on five years now. Doing much better than I was three years ago, but arguably still pretty bad. After like two years of trying and missed connections I finally got my foot in the door for intranasal Ketamine (Spravado) at a local hospital's clinic, and today was treatment two of eight (over five weeks).

The first time was a standard starting dosage--56mg. Dissociation/slowed down/wider field of view/sounds more apparent/staring at my hands a lot. Kind of pleasant and comforting.

Two days later I go in for the second round--doc says, you tolerated #1 pretty well, we're upping to 84mg. Ohh mannnn, it \*sucked.\* So agitated. Crazy anxiety. Time went really fast (but also not fast?). Watched my blood pressure on the vitals monitor, it totally spiked. Worst of it was over after about an hour; but I walked around the rest of the day angry, tired, and on edge. 

Like, I guess that's what people mean when they say there's good trips and bad trips. (I went in to day 2 preoccupied with work and stressed, which probably made things worse.)

I guess I'm just wondering, for other folks who have been through similar drug trials, how was your experience through the whole program? Are there ups and downs? Do you develop a tolerance to the dissociation/anxiety/different dosages?

Doc said acute experiences the day of treatment don't actually correlate with long-term treatment outcomes (i.e. don't worry if the actual drug trip sucked, long-term it'll be fine), but today was just \*so bad\*. Like I work a full-time job, and I couldn't go back to it after. My headspace was just toxic.

Treatment-resistant depression going on five years now. Doing much better than I was three years ago, but arguably still pretty bad. After like two years of trying and missed connections I finally got my foot in the door for intranasal Ketamine (Spravado) at a local hospital&amp;#39;s clinic, and today was treatment two of eight (over five weeks).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first time was a standard starting dosage--56mg. Dissociation/slowed down/wider field of view/sounds more apparent/staring at my hands a lot. Kind of pleasant and comforting.&lt;/p&gt;

Time went really fast (but also not fast?). Watched my blood pressure on the vitals monitor, it totally spiked. Worst of it was over after about an hour; but I walked around the rest of the day angry, tired, and on edge. &lt;/p&gt;

,depression,"Hello, 19 year old Australian here, just looking for a place to vent and get some perspective I guess.

So this whole thing needs some context, I'll try to keep it short so your time isn't eaten up.



I grew up with my mother and sister, my brother and father leaving the family before I was born, and growing up I was always the quiet one while my sister was the one getting into trouble.

Growing up, I had no friends as I was bullied right out of primary education for being blind in one eye and possessing a muscle deficiency, this meant I was inside a lot with only my sister and mother to keep me company, which I didn't mind, thinking it would persist, however I was wrong.

My sister left to go about her own goals at 16, leaving just me and Mum, who was homeschooling me at this stage, and my video games which I increasingly relied upon with every day that passed.

Since, I went through age 12-18 building an online group of friends that keeps me sane, as I never had the drive or goals to focus on that my sister did, all of the specific occupation work I wanted to join don't accept blind and/or muscle deficient people, among them being military and police duties.

I've developed horrendous self-worth, and have a constant need to feel validated because I've never felt like I've won at anything meaningful, ever. 

Every hobby I've tried I've lost motivation in because every failure feels like a sucker punch, every setback a mountain instead of the anthill it really is.


I also have nobody I trust to confide my fears into or consult, my mother could be quite aggressive when I was younger and I developed a genuine fear of both disappointing her and upsetting her in equal measure, and laying my feelings on the table feels more akin to volunteering for interrogation than discussing problems.

I also don't go to my sister because I'm not much like her, I love her to bits but her personality conflicts with mine and I also feel inferior to her in every regard, so a bit of fear of failure hampering that, too.


I have, somehow, obtained real friends through my 3-year participation at a TAFE school in my local area, but I constantly compare myself to them negatively and feel like both;
A burden because I'm quiet and lack any social skills.  The laughing stock of my friend group for the same reasons.

I like to think I'm very empathetic, but that's about all I'm good for and my anxiety keeps me from trying to breach my comfort bubble no matter how much positive reinforcement I obtain.


This leaves me where I am at now.
19 years old with no healthy hobbies, no ability to drive a car, a terrible self worth due to my disadvantages and a dysfunctional family and friend environment.

I feel consistently unloved and don't exactly blame anyone for it, I have mistreated my mother in my opinion but my complete lack of drive slows any attempt to fix my errors to a standstill, same goes for any attempt to bond with my sister, so their poor opinion of me is warranted I feel.

I feel like my friends wouldn't notice if I stopped visiting, as I don't really talk to them much anyway on account of not having anything interesting to say, though I do visit to check on their mental health a lot of the time. 

A lot of days I wake up and breathe a sigh of disappointment, it would be easier for my family and friends if this coddled, pointless kid I am was replaced by someone with a drive, or if that weren't possible, if I hadn't existed in the first place as was planned.


Even so, here I am, I'm not going anywhere and nothings going to change, this is the point where a stronger person would realize the only way to survive is by going up, but I can't seem to reach that state no matter how strongly I think I want to.



So yeah, that's the state of me I guess, thanks for reading if you did, hope you're doing better than I am.

,depression,"I started medications back in September and was on them for four months, until January. The psychiatrist that put me on them did not listen to me and literally forgot that he’d prescribed me the drugs in the first place. They made me so tired that I had to tell my school and sleep during at least 2 periods a day, even with a bunch of coffee and adequate sleep the night before. They also made me have more suicidal thoughts and want to cut, but they calmed my anxiety down a bit which made me confused as to whether I should stay on them or not. 
After my psychiatrist refused to listen to me a second time and asked me who put me on the drugs in the first place (it was literally him), I decided to quit. I was in my final year of high school and I could not throw this year away to medicine, as my grades were dropping due to my low level of energy and my attendance in school was minimal because I could never wake up in the morning. 
My therapist doesn’t even know my first name. She cannot remember it for the life of her. And the last time I saw her I tried to bring up my fears of having manic depression and explain to her all of the reasons why and she completely ignored me. She talks to me like I am a child and like she understands the way I feel better than I do. She forgets everything I tell her (like I said, including my name), and doesn’t seem very interested in anything I have to say other than the answers to her own predetermined (before the sessions) questions. My last therapist stopped responding to my mother about our sessions and my mom did not really care enough to reach out again. I do not understand why I have reached out to professionals and they choose to throw medication and stupid ideas at me instead of listening to how I feel and actually wanting to diagnose and fix whatever is wrong with me. I understand psychiatrists are not therapists and medication is their job but I should still be able to talk about whatever I need to with a psychiatrist to help him better understand my feelings and needs. 
I have been concerned that I have manic depression (more commonly known as Bipolar Disorder now) for years. The first time I talked to another psychiatrist she asked me one question that I don’t even remember, then dismissed me as just trying to diagnose myself and told me that my depression (which is still not a real diagnosis, I’ve just been told I have depression, not even clinical depression) wasn’t as bad as I thought it was just because I “got angry sometimes and felt good sometimes”, which is definitely not how I’d described any of it to her. 
I was actually diagnosed with depression and anxiety 5 years ago and I am now 17. I’ve been looking for help while also trying to heal by myself because my family doesn’t have the money to keep finding new therapists/psychiatrists and no one takes our insurance.
