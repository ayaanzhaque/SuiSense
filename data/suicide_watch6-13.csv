###Summary###

**It's important to respect and understand people's experiences and emotions. It's never necessary, helpful, or kind to support suicidal intent. There are some common misconceptions (discussed below) about suicidal people and how to help them that can cause well-meaning people to inadvertently incite suicide. There are also people online who incite suicide on purpose, often while pretending to be sympathetic and helpful.** 

###Validate Feelings and Experiences, Not Self-Destructive Intentions###

We're here to offer support, not judgement.  That means accepting, with the best understanding we can offer, whatever emotions people express.  Suicidal people are suffering, and we're here to try to ease that by providing support and caring.  The most reliable way we know to de-escalate someone at risk is to give them the experience of feeling understood. That means not judging whether they should be feeling the way they are, or telling them what to do or not do.  

But there's an important line to draw here.  There's a crucial difference between empathizing with feelings and responding non-judgmentally to suicidal thoughts, and in any way endorsing, encouraging, or validating suicidal intentions or hopeless beliefs. 

Anything that condones suicide, even passively, *encourages* suicide. It isn't supportive and does not help. It also violates reddit's sitewide rules as well as our guidelines. Explicitly inciting suicide online is a criminal offense in most jurisdictions. 

Do not treat any OP's post as meaning that will definitely die by suicide and can't change their minds or be helped. Anyone who's able to read the comments here still has a chance to choose whether or not to try to keep living, even if they've also been experiencing intense thoughts of suicide, made a suicide plan, or started carrying it out.  

In [the most useful empirical model we have](https://www.apa.org/science/about/psa/2009/06/sci-brief), the desire to die by suicide primarily comes from two interpersonal factors; alienation and a sense of being a burden or having nothing to offer. These factors usually lead to a profound feeling of being unwelcome in the world. 

**So, any acceptance or reinforcement of suicidal intent, even something ""innocent"" like ""I hope you find peace"", is actually a form of covert shunning that validates a person's sense that they're unwelcome in the world. It will usually add to their pain even if kindly meant and gently worded.**  

###How to Avoid Validating Suicidal Intent###

Keep the following in mind when offering support to anyone at risk for suicide.  

* **People who say they don't want help usually can feel better if they get support that doesn't invalidate their emotions.** Unfortunately, [many popular ""good"" responses are actually counterproductive](https://www.speakingofsuicide.com/2015/03/03/what-not-to-say/). In particular, many friends and family tend to rely exclusively on trying to convince the suicidal person that ""it's not so bad"", and this is usually experienced as ""I don't understand what you're going through and I'm not going to try"".  People who've had ""help"" that made them feel worse don't want any more of the same.  It doesn't mean that someone who actually knows how to be supportive can't give them any comfort.   

*  **Most people who are suicidal want to end their** ***pain,*** **not their lives.**  It's almost never true that death is the only way to end these people's suffering. Of course there are exceptional situations, and we certainly acknowledge that, for some people, the right help can be difficult to find. But preventing someone's suicide doesn't mean prolonging their suffering if we do it by giving them real comfort and understanding. 

* ***An unfixable problem doesn't mean that a good life will never be possible***.  We don't have to fix or change anything to help someone feel better. It's important to keep in mind that the correlation between our outer circumstances and our inner experience is weaker and less direct than commonly assumed.  For every kind of difficult life situation, you will find some people who lapse into suicidal despair, and others who cope amazingly well, and a whole spectrum in between. A key difference is how much inner resilience the person has at the time. This can depend on many personal and situational factors. But when there's not enough, interpersonal support can both compensate for its absence and help rebuild it.  We go into more depth on the ""it gets better"" issue in [this PSA Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/25igd7/whats_wrong_with_it_gets_better_what_if_it_doesnt/) which is always linked from our sidebar (community info on mobile) guidelines. 

* **There are** ***always*** **more choices than brutally forcing someone to stay alive or passively letting them end their lives**.

To avoid accidentally breaking the anti-incitement rule, don't say or try to imply that acting on suicidal thoughts is a good idea, or that someone can't turn back or is already dead.  Do whatever you can to help them feel cared for and welcome, at least in this little corner of the world.  [Our talking tips](http://redd.it/igh87) offer more detailed guidance.

###Look Out for Deliberate Incitement.  It May Come in Disguise.###

Often comments that subtly encourage suicidal intent actually come from suicide fetishists and voyeurs ([unfortunately this is a real and disturbing phenomenon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Francis_Melchert-Dinkel)). People like this *are* out there and the anonymous nature of reddit makes us particularly attractive to them.  

They will typically try to scratch their psychological ""itch"" by saying things that push people closer to the edge.  They often do this by exploiting the myths that we debunked in the bullet points above.  Specifically you might see people doing the following:

* Encouraging the false belief that the only way suicidal people can end their pain is by dying.  **There are** ***always*** **more and better choices than ""brutally forcing someone to stay alive"" or helping (actively or passively) them to end their lives**.

* Creating an artificial and toxic sense of ""solidarity"" by linking their encouragement of suicide to empathy.  They will represent themselves as the only one who really understand the suicidal person, while either directly or indirectly encouraging their self-loathing emotions and self-destructive impulses.  **Since most people in suicidal crisis are in desperate need to empathy and understanding, this is a particularly dangerous form of manipulation.**  

Many suicide inciters are adept at putting a benevolent spin on their activities while actually luring people away from sources of real help.  A couple of key points to keep in mind: 

* **Skilled suicide intervention -- peer or professional -- is based on empathic responsiveness to the person's feelings that reduces their suffering in the moment.**  Contrary to pop-culture myths, it does **not** involve persuasion (""Don't do it!""), cheerleading (""You've got this!"") or meaningless false promises (""Trust me, it gets better!""), or invalidation (""Let me show you how things aren't as bad as you think!"").  Anyone who leads others to expect these kinds of toxic responses, or any other response that prolongs their pain, from expert help may be covertly pro-suicide. (Of course, people sometimes do have bad experience when seeking mental-health treatment, and it's fine to vent about those, but processing our own disappointment and frustration is entirely different from trying to destroy someone else's hope of getting help.)

* **Choices made by competent responders are always informed by the understanding that breaching someone's trust is traumatic and must be avoided if possible.**  Any kind of involuntary intervention is an **extremely unlikely** outcome when someone consults a clinician or calls a hotline. (Confidentiality is addressed in more detail in [our Hotlines FAQ post](http://redd.it/1c7ntr)). The goal is always to provide all help with the client's full knowledge and informed consent. We know that no individual or system is perfect.  Mistakes that lead to bad experiences do sometimes happen to vulnerable people, and we have enormous sympathy for them. But anyone who suggests that this is the norm might be trying to scare people away from the help they need.

,SuicideWatch,"Ive been on this sub for awhile. Ive tried to help people. Ive tried to be there for strangers who were hurting. I think I helped a couple of them, at least thats what they said in their e mails to me.
Im tired now. Ive spent my entire life chasing things thatI guess the universe has deemed me unworthy for.  
Its been this way since I was a kid. ( Im an old man now ) 
Ive always felt unworthy and not good enough even tho I have tried so hard. 
Im tired of this life now. Always hoping for things to get better, always hoping for a bit of good news but I guess this world doesnt want that for me.
It seems as if Ive had a black cloud over me most of my life. Im tired now.
I have come to accept that nothing will be good in my life for very long. I am tired of the constant worry.  It seems to me that the universe has me destined for failure and ive come to believe that this world will be better off without me in it.
I am hoping that my bad luck or bad karma or whatever the fuck it is will not follow my kids. 
Ive two wonderful kids and they have a really good shot at maybe having a real good life if I am no longer around. ( I know its selfish to write that, but I cannot stomach the pain anymore )
I no longer love this place or my life or this world.
I have no interest in anything any longer. I am pretty much just going thru the motions at this point.

Ive tried to help people. Ive tried to be there for strangers who were hurting. I think I helped a couple of them, at least thats what they said in their e mails to me.
Im tired now. Ive spent my entire life chasing things thatI guess the universe has deemed me unworthy for.&lt;br/&gt;
Its been this way since I was a kid. ( Im an old man now ) 
Ive always felt unworthy and not good enough even tho I have tried so hard. 
Im tired of this life now. Always hoping for things to get better, always hoping for a bit of good news but I guess this world doesnt want that for me.
It seems as if Ive had a black cloud over me most of my life. Im tired now.
I have come to accept that nothing will be good in my life for very long. I am tired of the constant worry.  It seems to me that the universe has me destined for failure and ive come to believe that this world will be better off without me in it.
I am hoping that my bad luck or bad karma or whatever the fuck it is will not follow my kids. 
Ive two wonderful kids and they have a really good shot at maybe having a real good life if I am no longer around. ( I know its selfish to write that, but I cannot stomach the pain anymore )
I no longer love this place or my life or this world.
I have no interest in anything any longer. I am pretty much just going thru the motions at this point.

I have a plan now. So the universe or whomever is pulling the strings can fuck right off.

How could somebody that always loved me so hard, just hurted me so bad??? I’ve been thinking a lot about suicide, and still thinking right now. I see no more future, no more happiness, like why am I even working if I have nothing to work for???? Whatever I do reminds me of him, and all our memories.&lt;/p&gt;

And that’s true i left most my friends from high school behind and I didn’t make many in college and I’m not connecting with people at work. I have a few acquaintances but no one I am close with. I’m going to be alone forever and I don’t think it’s worth it. I can’t be a toxic leach in some other persons life either.&lt;/p&gt;

I'm ''currently'' studying in college but have been tormented by people that slowly has been pushing their work onto me, eventually it became too much as it was severly affecting my studies. I tried talking to the counsellor and she said i should just avoid them, but it's hard since they became so dependent of me.  I had the mindset  everyday of rather killing myself than giving them a freeride. Had took a break from school since i've slowly started to hate the whole education and my life. Trying to change environment i thought would've been a solution but i still feel like i just want to end it all, instead of going back to face the same situation.

Some days it can be decent, but other days i feel good for 5 minutes and the next minute i just want to drive my car 150mph into a wall without seatbelt. I feel like i've become bipolar and it's making me mad crazy. Sometimes i can sit in my car almost one hour after parking just think, what's the fucking point.

I just wanted to ventilate as i have noone else to talk to and my parents really don't understand. My dad just tease me for having bad work-ethic and my brothers just think suicide thoughts is a joke...

,SuicideWatch,"I’ve been getting closer to accepting death, fear of it and nonexistence is the only thing keeping me from committing suicide now. I was born with an immune system that’s practically nonexistent. I was recently potentially exposed to corona. Tonight I felt like I hit a wall and I feel like shit. Feverish, headache, exhausted, sore like I pulled a muscle, congested, dry coughing, shortness of breath, tickle in my throat. I’m sure I’ll wake up tomorrow sick beyond belief.

I don’t intend to tell anyone if I do. I don’t intend to do anything. I won’t get help, I won’t take medicine, I won’t eat, I won’t get out of bed. I won’t fight it. I’ll just let it take me. Because I’m too much of a pussy to kill myself directly. In case I’m too weak to later, I wrote a last letter tonight. I guess it’s not really a “suicide letter” but it serves the same function. My feelings, my gratitude for death, my wishes for my body.

I’m writing here because I can’t tell anyone else what’s going through my mind, or I’m sure they’d insist on the hospital. I don’t want to go through it. It’s less painful for my family if they find out I passed, instead of watching it happen, and all I ever do is cause pain.

I’ll spare you the details of why my life was doomed from the start — 5 mental illness diagnosis, an immune system disease, more physical problems. Anytime I share the story online, I just get horror and sympathy. I don’t care about that, I just want someone who can relate to how I feel.

The first time I tried to kill myself, I was 7 years old. I didn’t even know what suicide was. My parents were strict back then, before they eased up because they realized I was in for a shitty life. I wasn’t allowed to watch TV, or see movies. God forbid I so much as look at a computer. I went to a private school. I didn’t know anything. I don’t even think I really understood death, I just knew that I couldn’t take the pain anymore. I tried to slice open my throat. Didn’t get very far, turns out it takes a lot of strength to make any real damage with a kitchen knife. My parents caught me really quickly.

Since then my life has been shit. I’m a terrible daughter, I was a terrible friend to the few that I had — they all ditched me eventually. I haven’t had a friend in 3 years now, and I’m almost 21. Never had a boyfriend either, or a real date, or even a first kiss. I have subpar grades. I’ve dropped out of college twice now.

Maybe I could deal, but I have a younger sister, only a year apart. She’s gorgeous, model body, way smarter and harder working than I’ll ever be. Perfect mental health, perfect physical health. Everyone loves her, my parents dote on her and have made it obvious since we were young that she’s their favorite. In high school, people in my grade who acted like I didn’t exist approached me for the first time to ask about her, say how pretty she was. “It must be hard having a cheerleader sister who looks like that.” Thanks. She’s a genuinely nice person, too — easy to get along with, doesn’t have a mean bone in her body. Bets any guy she wants. Even the few guys who have shown interest in me suddenly ignore me to ask about her if they so much see her tagged in my socials. It’s fucking awful.

I just can’t put up with this anymore. I was born broken. I’m a failure. All the suffering didn’t give me perspective, it just made me a bitter, bad person. I’m going nowhere in life.

&lt;p&gt;The first time I tried to kill myself, I was 7 years old. I didn’t even know what suicide was. My parents were strict back then, before they eased up because they realized I was in for a shitty life. I wasn’t allowed to watch TV, or see movies. God forbid I so much as look at a computer. I went to a private school. I didn’t know anything. I don’t even think I really understood death, I just knew that I couldn’t take the pain anymore. I tried to slice open my throat. Didn’t get very far, turns out it takes a lot of strength to make any real damage with a kitchen knife. My parents caught me really quickly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since then my life has been shit. I’m a terrible daughter, I was a terrible friend to the few that I had — they all ditched me eventually. I haven’t had a friend in 3 years now, and I’m almost 21. Never had a boyfriend either, or a real date, or even a first kiss. I have subpar grades. I’ve dropped out of college twice now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Maybe I could deal, but I have a younger sister, only a year apart. She’s gorgeous, model body, way smarter and harder working than I’ll ever be. Perfect mental health, perfect physical health. Everyone loves her, my parents dote on her and have made it obvious since we were young that she’s their favorite. In high school, people in my grade who acted like I didn’t exist approached me for the first time to ask about her, say how pretty she was. “It must be hard having a cheerleader sister who looks like that.” Thanks. She’s a genuinely nice person, too — easy to get along with, doesn’t have a mean bone in her body. Bets any guy she wants. Even the few guys who have shown interest in me suddenly ignore me to ask about her if they so much see her tagged in my socials. It’s fucking awful.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I just can’t put up with this anymore. I was born broken. I’m a failure. All the suffering didn’t give me perspective, it just made me a bitter, bad person. I’m going nowhere in life. No one gives a shit about me. If God wants to finally give me some peace and wipe me out with this stupid fucking pandemic, I’m grateful.&lt;/p&gt;

I’ve always had these problems but I could always manage it after enough trying. It got so much worse after I got rejected by someone I love with everything I have. It started off similar to other times, everything seeming to collapse in and me crying every day, and then slowly but surely fading away as I managed to contain myself.

It’s nowhere near as strong as it used to be, although that could be because I’m now on antidepressants. It still lasts all the time and it’s been months that I’ve been feeling the same with literally no change - constant numbness and a feeling that it can’t get better. I’ve never felt a genuine desire to commit suicide before no matter how bad things got (and things have been way way worse before but I’ve always managed to come out of it) and now I’m genuinely considering that the only way I don’t constantly feel this way is to... yeah.

So I have to face her everyday and be reminded every time for years... I just don’t think I can handle that if I can’t even handle it after a few months.

Nothing is more distressing being in my early 20's thinking about my most likely cause of death. I don't care about suddenly dying (car impact, gunshot, etc.). There is nothing worse than knowing that i have a slow killer in my lungs. Every morning once I wake up my brain starts to go full on 1000% thinking about my suspected future lung disease. I am tired of suffering, I feel depressed and demotivated. I am trying to check WHEN will I disappear (depending on the flowchart; maybe I don't have pneumoconiosis).

,SuicideWatch,"Hello.

I'm a 17 year old male who has been contemplating harming myself for a while now. Considering my age I already know what you are typing at this very moment, ""you're so young"", ""life will change"", ""you have your whole life ahead of you"", stuff like that right? 

Well, the thing is, I just don't think I ever genuinely enjoyed the idea of life, at all. It's just constant hurdles to jump through, constant suffering, constant existence, when a lot of the time I wish that my existence be taken away in exchange for being eternally neutral... Devoid of any emotion, rather than living in a world that I am destined to suffer.

Obviously there are mini pockets of joy that happen every once and a while, but I'd just consider this human pleasure more than genuine enjoyment of life itself.

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m a 17 year old male who has been contemplating harming myself for a while now. Considering my age I already know what you are typing at this very moment, &amp;quot;you&amp;#39;re so young&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;life will change&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;you have your whole life ahead of you&amp;quot;, stuff like that right? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well, the thing is, I just don&amp;#39;t think I ever genuinely enjoyed the idea of life, at all. It&amp;#39;s just constant hurdles to jump through, constant suffering, constant existence, when a lot of the time I wish that my existence be taken away in exchange for being eternally neutral... Devoid of any emotion, rather than living in a world that I am destined to suffer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Obviously there are mini pockets of joy that happen every once and a while, but I&amp;#39;d just consider this human pleasure more than genuine enjoyment of life itself.&lt;/p&gt;

,SuicideWatch,"Honestly I don't know if I've ever been this low in my life before. My mental health is deteriorating fast and physically I'm not doing very well either. I really don't know why I'm posting on here, no one can change my life but me...but I suppose I just want to feel heard and not alone? This year started out amazing for me, everything was going so perfectly. I think that's part of why I am struggling so badly, because the higher and happier you get in life, the lower and harder you fall. Anyways, I'm going to share a \*few\* of the problems in my life and how I've reached what feels like rock bottom...

I have gambled (addictively) in the stock market since I was 16; I lost a lot of money in high school (all of my savings from my first job) and never really forgave myself for that. I promised I would make it back one day and after taking a break from trading I started again last year...after practicing a couple trading strategies and losing a small amount last summer, I decided to invest (long term) a substantial amount in December of 2019...Due to a lot of luck (gambling) + a bit of research I was able to double my account in a month. I was elated, I had made all of my high school losses back and more! But I became greedy and quickly fell into my old gambling habits. The money was once again all gone (profit + principal) by the end of February 2020. I am now super disappointed in myself and feel very ashamed and guilty for doing this again. I work so hard and save all of my money and then just gamble it away...even when the universe gives me another chance I still haven't learned my lesson with greed. What is wrong with me? Why couldn't I just be happy with what I had? It was more than enough to need at my age.

This is when things started to fall apart fast and my depression started to return. Covid hit my city at the beginning of March and my university classes were cancelled and moved online. I was able to scrape by and receive credit for all of my courses, but my anxiety was super high the whole time...because I am on academic probation, if I had failed one more I would have been kicked out entirely. It was just a few days into the pandemic that I realized the guy I had been ""dating"" for 3 months wasn't actually being exclusive with me even though we agreed to be...I had to ""break up"" with him for that reason but still can't stop thinking about him. I am gay and it was my first what I thought to be ""real relationship"" with a guy. We talked on the phone for several hours and both cried but I don't feel like I can move on from him. I feel alone and miss him almost every day even though he cheated on me. I want to hate him but I just can't since I know he's been through some shit in life and uses sex to cope with his traumas...

Without him + university, my social interaction dwindled substantially and due to losing most of my money I felt like I needed to make it back right away so I (stupidly) agreed to work full time at my previously part time grocery store job. The pandemic has made things hell at work for the past 3 months and they are only now starting to improve. Wearing a mandatory mask for 8 hours takes a toll on a person, as does having customers yell and threaten you. I have had to get tested twice for covid because there was an outbreak at my store and I was under mandatory isolation at home for 2 weeks since my coworker tested positive. Due to the stress of all of this, I developed shingles (which young people are not supposed to get) and had to deal with extreme pain + itching for a week. It gave my some time off work though, so I guess that was a good thing?

I know things can get better with time and help, but honestly I feel like I have no purpose in life anymore. I am failing miserably at my other job which I thought was going to be my first career...this is making me reconsider my whole degree and all of the money I have potentially wasted. I feel worthless some days and don't get out of bed or leave my room on my days off work. I have stopped eating regularly and have no energy to due simple tasks. The only things that bring me joy right now are trading (even though I know I shouldn't be), video games, and sleeping. I've never attempted but I have thought about the ways in which to kill myself and think about suicide almost every day. I thought my antidepressants would help but I don't notice much of a difference even after taking them for the past couple of months...Maybe counselling can ""fix"" me or help me work through my issues, but even then what's the point?

,SuicideWatch,"Everything i touch i ruin. 

1-Lost the love of my life and my best friend. He apparently was never in love with me. What I thought best thing happened to me in a decade was a lie. He took al my hopes and dreams with him and doesn’t even want to talk to me anymore. I tried to hold onto him so hard so long i broke it. 

2- Unemployed never been able to hold onto a job more than 18 months all my life. I bought a house and i cant find a job and i am in the hospital i had some saved money but its gonna run out and eventually bank is gonna take the house back and i don’t care whats gonna happen to me but i am worried about my dad. 

3-Hospitalized because I haven’t been able to eat anything in two weeks and passed out in the kitchen while cooking for my dad. Bunch of 2nd degree oil burns. Almost burned the house down and my wounds are infected and they are not doing good because I still cant eat anything i am so weak i take breaks even while writing this. Now i have stomach ulcers apparently and doctors doesn’t say to my face but i can see they think i am entitled brat for still not being able to eat while people have real problems in their life. 

4- Reached out to my “friends” most emphatic response i got was ‘yeah you will be sad for a while’ reached out online to forums and support groups. There was few people asking me how i was doing then they got fed up with me I guess they haven’t been texting. Everyone keeps telling me move on and forget but no one is telling me how to do that. And I am not sure if i want to. 

I am either sad or i feel nothing and i am holding onto the sadness cuz not feeling anything scares me worse. I have been there for 15 years I don’t want to go trough it again I don’t think i can take another 15 years of it i am 30 in couple of months. 

Apparently i ruin everything i touch and I kept telling me after everything things will get better I will survive I don’t believe that anymore. Nothing gets better in my life ever. If i get happiness for a while every time it becomes worse thats what my life is pockets of happiness between a downhill run. Every time gives me hope every time i crush and burn. I don’t have the will to fight anymore. 

I can just tell I refuse treatment and go home and die in a week or two. My dad will have the house have less debt. Sure he will be sad for a while but he will be over it eventually. All I did was bring him misery anyway. I have been in the hospital for 5 days and had 0 visitors no one cares about my existence anyway why should i keep fighting just to continue to be a burden. 

I told him help me survive this I don’t want to die and he just stopped answering me. I waited an hour 3 am holding my phone in my hand trying not fall asleep so i don’t miss if he messaged me. I got angry and called him out on what he was doing and the response was “what the fuck do you want me to say? i didnt have a response cuz you basically said the same thing i already responded to. i had to eat get ready for my stream. you are a grown woman. you need to take responsibility for yourself. we are not together anymore. what you are doing is toxic, for the both of us. i cant make you feel better because the second i dont live up to your demands you pull this shit. you know what i was doing.” The person i loved more than myself ladies and gentlemen I didn’t want to be in a relationship again. I wanned him to be my friend. He can’t even do that. People keep telling he is a piece of shit but I still love him and others calling him bad names makes me feel worse about myself because I still love him after everything. I keep reading all his messages where he says hateful things at me and I feel worse and i am glad I felt worse cuz if not i am not gonna feel nothing and when i stop feeling sad and start feeling empty inside I don’t wanna do that again.

,SuicideWatch,"I really dont want to live anymore I swear

The last... YEAR or something, has just been such a mess, its a miracle im still around i wont lie.

First it begun with last year of high school, and the sudden “oh fuck” realisation that its soon to be all over, that all these beautiful memories and moments will never come back. That i’ll never experience sitting in the library with my friends on breaks and watching shitty ytps... 
Life used to be so much better then, i had friends, connections, a purpose, my depression wasn’t so bad either.

Unfortunately it all did eventually come to an end, we graduated, and eventually went our separate ways, they seem to cope better than be but, at the time i at least had my bf to kinda anchor me and motivate me.

I soon started to struggle with university, i felt so fucking lonely, it took me months to get a real friend group and at that point it was pretty much too late, i lasted until December, and then dropped out. It was a huge failure, but at least i had my art, my bf, ya know, stuff to look forward to?

WELL then he broke up with me. Specially because im a depressed mess. Got so bad i got fucking cops called to my house because i was set on killing myself.

Fast forward a few shitty weeks, turns out i have some shit called BPD or something? I really dont know, that breakup left me a giant mess.

Im afraid of new relationships because im terrified of them ending, this applies to friendships too...

I’ve been sitting inside for almost half a year now, rotting away... Im considering ending it all again, I didn’t sign up for this, and all i know it would have been better for everybody if i was never born.

I only feel kinda bad for my parents. I let them down and i know it. Most people will probably remember me poorly but, i hope they dont. I hope they do eventually move on.

Mother death, with her ghostly pale face, pink lips, and everescent smile, her two golden eyes that shine brighter then even the sun itself. She is often misunderstood in her endeavours. She has a garden in her kingdom, you wouldn’t believe but yes a garden. Laid out in the darkest depths of her household where even the ground runs black in its dirt, and from that dark ground mother death plants her seeds, she takes sincere care of each and every plant, her sunflowers, her beautiful sunflowers. You see mother death simply lives with her sunflowers. They span acres of ashen land, from the black as the yellow flowers emerge atop their green stems. Mother death lives in hell. Its her home, like any racial equality clause she didn’t have much of a choice and frankly the darkness made her quite emo. 

Her neighbour hood is truly plagued by the human disease known as death, but mother death, the women herself she plants her sunflowers. She tends to her acres And acres of land, taking sweet care with every little sunflower, talking sweetly to the wilted ones as she feeds them some extra water from the river styx. A magical solution to help her garden grow. She sings melancholy songs to her dying sunflowers and sweet ones to her babies, still growing from the ashen ground. 

You see, mother death loves her sunflowers, and her eternal love and devotion to her billions of sunflowers has grounded them all deep within the roots of the hellian ground, a mystic land holding mystical powers. But mother death the sweet lady in her black flowy dress with the gentle smile the lady who sang to sunflowers, she lived in hell, she lived among those exiled and ya know racial property discrimination yaddda yadda yadda you get the picture. Anyway, there was a hound dog, larger than any elephant in the human world, he belonged to a viscous man who lived up high at the end of the dark ashen road behind big barren gates with ivory curling around its metal, in a big black and red mansion. Mother death had never met the man, she simply tended to her sunflowers everyday, she’d sing to every single one everyday and pour her love and soul into them. Some sunflowers moved closer in clusters their roots interiorising under the dark ground. 

Mother death kept singing and they kept flourishing, deepening their roots into the magic more powerful then the ancient powers. Mother death loved her sunflowers, one day as she tended to her younglings and sang through her field, the big black dog with the red dog tag made his way over the fence without mother death knowing. He in all his brute ran towards mother death, who in her blissful singing was unaware. Her sunflowers ailed and weeped for her to listen to move to do anything but st
and there but mother death didn’t hear their distress. In an attempt to protect her from a mauling the sunflowers cluttered and pushed their roots from the dark ashen earth, protecting their mother, the women who fed them, sang to them and raised them the women who showed them love. They fussed their roots in a defence against the big black hound. All together standing as one. But they were measly sunflowers no matter how powerful their powers weren’t match for a hell hound. With its big sharp teeth in its massive mouth the hound bit through the sunflower roots, ripping and shredding and using his paws to keep digging. The sunflowers cried for their mother who in her song heard their distress she turned around to see the brute hound ripping out her sunflowers and shredding them. She wailed and mother death ran towards the animal. You see did I mention her eyes glowed gold? Like brighter then the sun? Yeah she was a terrifying image, her black flowing dress her pale face, her plump lips her bright angry eyes and her mother’s battle cry. She pulled up her dress and ran for the brute. He like any sane animal or human was afraid of the wailing mother. He grabbed the roots on the flower and put the sunflowers in his mouth and chucked them, with all his might. He called up the powers of the man whose house he is to guard, the devil himself and through the use of Magic also or maybe more ancient he sent the flowers and their wailing cried up upon the earth to land on mother earths land. He then ran, but the poor mutt, he got lost on mother deaths acres and acres of land. Mother death herself didn’t run she sat in the spot of the old flowers and weeped with all her might, she fixed the patch of soil now empty and bare. And cried. The mutt still running for a way out simply couldn’t find one, he knew mother death would be coming for him the kind gentle lady whose world he had ripped apart, but no matter where the mutt ran there were only sunflowers it was as if the lady had billions planted. He knew Mother Death would find him and he also knew that she had spent time fixing up the land he ripped, he knew what would happened if she found him. He in his fear started ripping out more sunflowers, in different patches accross the mothers flowering field as to not raise a trail, he chucked them all with his might into the face of Mother Earth. Mother death in her grief heard her children cry  and she followed the sounds, she found broken apart land and every time she’d sit there and tend her children, she’d fix the land and weep. This continued the hound would rip the wailing sunflowers and fling them to earth, mother death would follow in her grief to every site and would cry every time and fix up the land. 

Between all this chaos, Mother Earth who was content in her home heard wailing and screeching she was concerned, she looked and looked and found sunflowers, sitting upon the imprint of the earth all crying out in despair. Mother Earth asked the sunflowers what was wrong and they explained the mutt and mother deaths despair. And Mother Earth hearing another mothers pain extended a hand, she bellowed into the hells over mother deaths field in her godly voice, “mother death I see and hear your despair I grant your hurting heart a favour for these sunflowers, I cannot send them back to hell as I am from a different world. But mother death how may I take care of these flowers with love upon my earth” 

Mother death in her grief cried out “curse this mutt, and his owner who shall pay for my pain. I want you to sculpt them all in my image, give them a soul so they can truly leave love, but I want them to come home, I need them to come home, to fill my barren fields and ashy ground” 

Mother Earth understood her prayers, she gave the sunflowers souls and she made them exactly like mother death but more like a normal version of her a more human version. Pale skin, the form of a god, but lack of abilities. She gave ten souls and they were sunflowers they’re true make. She crafted mother deaths springs of love into children. Every time the hound would chuck more sunflowers on the earth and mother death would wail, Mother Earth would take the crying flowers and give them life and purpose upon her face. This cycle would never end because the mutt was an idiot who’d never find his way out of mother deaths acres of farm and mother death would mourn every sunflower that was ripped from its roots.

That is why, when the final embrace comes, Mother death is there her arms open wide her back flowy dress, it’s all too familiar warmth. She’s not there to take you away or to hurt or manipulate you. Mother death opens her arms to take you back to the garden from which you were made. You fear what you don’t remember and she soothes you “we’re going back home” she says and everyday she lives in fear or losing ore of her flowers and grief of he ones she loses but she moves on because everyday her children come back to her garden to finally rest.

I'm exhausted.  


Just as good as fucked.  


Tired of playing the tough guy. Tired of working excessively hard to survive. Fed up of this shit.  


You know, life is hard. Everyone is suffering. No one can help or give two shits about me. Everyone is say, occupied.  


I didn't say life is easy. But it shouldn't be hard all the time. And I'm exhausted.  


But I have to fight on to survive. How? By working excessively hard to the point of mental exhaustion.  


I can't get a job. South Korea is known damn well for unemployment. If you want a job, you have to be highly educated. Since everyone's well-educated, the stakes are high. You might ask, ""Start your own company."" Can't. The big companies will liquidate every chance of that!  


Same shit goes to US. Since the economy's screwed since the recession, it's hard to get a job. Since US has high expenses, that's also a minus. To survive in US, I have to do the same horseshit like I do here! Being competitive, working your backs off to be highly educated, and basically getting exhausted.  


And what the hell did I learn? Life is hard everywhere. UK is losing healthcare because of US, for instance.  


No matter where I go, I have to work my ass off to barely survive. So tired of this shit.  


When I was in my early 20s, I wanted to do what I wanted to do. My father opposed this shit. Since life is hard, I had to toughen up. That is no crying, sacrifice your life and be up to standards of the snobby elites. Work to the point of passing out and die. I think that's the resolve. Maybe he was partially right. And I'm getting frustrated.  


Who needs to commit suicide when you overwork and burn out? When you can die from it?  


I'm a religious man and I can't commit suicide (I'm not asking you to proselytize). But I can overwork and die instead.  


But instead of dying, I can go psychotic. Since I have Bipolar disorder, I can explode and have a mental breakdown. I can really harm someone.  


So what's the point of grinding on? It gets me nowhere. I'm done with this mind-wrack.  


But I didn't say I give up on life. I want to live life in a different approach. Go to trips. Japan would be nice. I just wanna take a break until the economy improves...

&lt;p&gt;Same shit goes to US. Since the economy&amp;#39;s screwed since the recession, it&amp;#39;s hard to get a job. Since US has high expenses, that&amp;#39;s also a minus. To survive in US, I have to do the same horseshit like I do here! Being competitive, working your backs off to be highly educated, and basically getting exhausted.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And what the hell did I learn? Life is hard everywhere. UK is losing healthcare because of US, for instance.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No matter where I go, I have to work my ass off to barely survive. So tired of this shit.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I was in my early 20s, I wanted to do what I wanted to do. My father opposed this shit. Since life is hard, I had to toughen up. That is no crying, sacrifice your life and be up to standards of the snobby elites. Work to the point of passing out and die. I think that&amp;#39;s the resolve. Maybe he was partially right. And I&amp;#39;m getting frustrated.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Who needs to commit suicide when you overwork and burn out? When you can die from it?  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m a religious man and I can&amp;#39;t commit suicide (I&amp;#39;m not asking you to proselytize). But I can overwork and die instead.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But instead of dying, I can go psychotic. Since I have Bipolar disorder, I can explode and have a mental breakdown. I can really harm someone.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So what&amp;#39;s the point of grinding on? It gets me nowhere. I&amp;#39;m done with this mind-wrack.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But I didn&amp;#39;t say I give up on life. I want to live life in a different approach. Go to trips. Japan would be nice. I just wanna take a break until the economy improves... If not, I don&amp;#39;t give a rip.&lt;/p&gt;

,SuicideWatch,"Hi to all of you,

so I (male, over 28) am here at the psychiatric hospital close to 4 weeks. Had some deep lows and many suicidal thoughts but after dosing up to 225 mg Venlafaxine at least I don't experience the deep lows anymore. (CAUTION: In some patients antidepressants can increase the suicide risk. Possibly because they first increase drive but not mood. So you still feel depressed but now you have more energy to act on your suicidal thoughts. Always talk to your doctor!)

I try to participate in every therapy described and get up at 7-7:30 am during the week and 8:00:8:30 on the weekends.

I still often feel hopeless about the future (job, economy, family) but I hope this gets better, too.

One thing I experienced already as a child is feeling hurt by minor social - how should I say it? - events.

For example, today other patients played a board game at 11 am. I decided to join because I thought it would be good to have some contact with the other patients. Off course, we were interrupted  by lunch and decided to continue afterwards. So I waited in the lounge and nobody appeared. A nice “girl“ (18-19? I am at least ten years older) offeres to ask her roomate whether they changed plans (visiting patients in their rooms is not allowed). So she came back and said they decided to continue at 2 pm. When I returned again at that time now other people were missing. One declared he wasn't interested anymore, the other person just did not show up.
So “we“ decided to quit it.

I know this sounds unimportant but these things always hurt me. Especially because I did not wrote a letter which I wanted at 11 am.

When I got back to my room I felt very lonely without any friend in the world. And then the thoughts about unemployment came back and I thought it would be better just to end everything.

I will, however, NOT DO THAT! I will keep on fighting. And so, I hope, will every reader of this post.

,SuicideWatch,"Hello, I am writting this because I need to tell someone or something this. I'm 15 and have a sister. My parents are what I would call superficial, they don't care about things if they don't interfere with them, basically aslong as I can smile and act good and well for other people to see a healthy and smart son they couldn't care less, thing is my grades are not top notch so my mom kinda tries to motivate me on the other hand my dad judges me for everything i do, I can feel it so I avoid any visual contact.
Then we have my sister which for complicated reasons has cut ties with me and basically sees me as a normal person, we don't speak ever basically, she is the best trading card my parents have and the main topic for every conversation, she spends her whole days studying. She is basically the best student at everything and I feel compared to her at everything I do.
My mind has some problems and I can't think of myself doing anything successful without it trying to shut it off or turning it into something bad, whenever I think of a girl I have a crush on or something it painfully rejects it, I don't even know how to explain it, I can't have good dreams either it is all just stopped so I can't even find happiness inside my head in fantasies which I have for the first 10 years of my life.
So basically at this point I feel like a worthless and neglected son, from here I would turn on friends for company or support but I have come to not trust anyone for some reason, everything in my head is bad, that person bad that other person bad etc, making matters worse i'm pretty sure my school life has always been a symbiotic one in which I would find myself in groups of ""friends"" that would always be toxic and rude and distasteful.
I would make my way back home knowing everything that happened was probably a lie, and would have to then endure the home life which was worse, I would have to not talk because my sister was studying, and god knows what would happen, she would move further away in the house but nobody would tell me so I would end up having to stay silent and avoid playing with my friends online which was something I enjoyed until recently.
Now my days are wake up do school stuff, spend the morning thinking, have lunch in which I'm pretty sure my dad chews loudly so that I get pissed of, can't say anything or else would get slapped and ground for a month, go to my room I don't even get enjoyment out of games or books alike, recently I have used my time to organize my room to pass time, reach dinner and my dad pisses me off again, also if my sister is on the table I will get completely ignored, and then I go to bed where I have to sleep hearing my sister doing god knows what in her room and calling it studying until 5 am.
Also I have to do as little to no sound if she is sleeping, she sleeps until like 15, because she can wake up but then if I'm trying to sleep until 10 or 12 and everyone is up except me nobody cares, my mom comes into the room not even knocking, they never do, my sister slams evey door, and my dad does nothing because he does aproach me if he doesn't need me.
I'm pretty sure nobody likes me and judges me and makes fun of me behind my back, be it in school or my family, I'm not good looking or good at social stuff, I'm aldo pretty sure I'm pansexual so I can't tell anyone or it will even be worse. My mind feels like it is trying to kill me mentaly.
Probably at this point nobody would actually be sad about my death so yeah I don't want to keep doing this either, when covid is cured or I can leave the house freely I will probably if I can find the courage throw myself off a building head first into the ground.
I spend at least 3 hours trying to sleep but I can't because I'm having suicidal thoughts, it all starts with me not remembering the last time I heard my parents telling me they loved me or they showing some signs of affection.

I used to live on my own a few years ago when work was better but now I've been sentenced to a living nightmare for almost ten years. I keep struggling to make ends meet no matter what I do, going more and more into debt as the days go by, while I get rejection emails from every worthwhile lucrative salary jobs I've applied to and I've only got one job offer from a local grocery store who only want someone to work part-time for shitty minimum wage that's not worth my time. Keep in mind that I have a college degree and multiple years of experience in marketing and graphic design.

My parents also don't really communicate with me because they've been abused mentally all their lives by their culture's bullshit and have submitted the quality of their lives to their family's choices. They just ask me the generic ""how are you?"" and that's it, thinking that's enough without actually caring about how I'm really doing. I absolutely love my parents, but I hate how they've just provided for me the essentials (food, clothes, roof over my head) without ever thinking of preparing me for life's countless hardships or to teach me how to observe and understand my emotions effectively as a child so that I can grow up to be mentally stable as an adult.

The fucking cherry on top that completely makes my life a complete living hell is my heartless, hateful, egomaniac of a younger brother who doesn't give a fuck about anyone but himself and who tortures me and my parents on a daily basis. He's always high off his ass and talking loudly and getting worked up about stupid shit, which makes me and my parents always on edge and scared. He also talks to himself while cussing nonstop, as if he's fighting an imaginary person, and sings obnoxiously loud throughout the day and in the early mornings to clearly get on mine and my parents nerves. I've tried talking to him, pleading with him, debating with him, reason with him every way possible, sympathizing with him to better understand him, physically fought him when he decided to attack me out of anger, called the cops on him to protect my parents, but everything I've tried was to no avail. My efforts are hopelessly futile.

My lack of sleep and my constant exposure to my brother's drama has permanently traumatized me. He's threatened me and my parents physically and legally if I ever try to commit him or get him arrested. The funny thing is, he has a good job that makes him good money yet he still makes everyone miserable, mentally torturing my parents just because he can and has no sympathy at all for us.

I seriously don't know what else to do. He is a fucking nightmare that I cannot escape and neither can my parents. My dad's also sick with an enlarged prostate and my mom is a timid, feeble older woman who can't put her foot down, she just keeps taking his shit and coddling him despite how much she mentally suffers from his verbal abuse. I don't want this abuse to happen to my parents anymore and I don't want to hurt them by taking my life, but I don't know what else to do other than end my suffering. Maybe then my family finally will realize how good of a son I really was and my death will also let them finally see how much of a narcissistic piece of shit my brother is and have him committed indefinitely.

I'm 28, never had a gf, never had a job, am in the last semester of uni, know 3 languages, love to draw and paint.

I have so much to live for, and yet, here I am with a rope just ready to finish it all. My life was always sad, always trying my best to please, being bullied constantly throughout my life by my older brother and kids at school left me with mental scars for years and severe anxiety.

I'm just so tired of it all, waking up in pain, going to sleep in pain, being afraid of eating, wasting days away because I'm just too fatigued, too tired and other people thinking I'm a loser for not having a job at my age despite trying my hardest.

I&amp;#39;m sitting in the bathroom trying to both cry quietly and post this bc I feel like I&amp;#39;m right on the edge.

,SuicideWatch,"I'm 27 years old and I've been contemplating suicide for going on 15 years. I'm not sure if everything fits here or if I'm going to ramble; I just want to get it off my chest. 

I honestly don't even know where to start so I'll just start from the beginning. When I was about 12 years old my parents got a divorce. If I had to speak honestly I wish both of them would die. 

My mother is what I think to be suffering from borderline personality disorder; she is insufferable to talk to about anything. When I told her that I was attracted to men her response was ""How could you do this to me?"" When I try to talk to her about anything going on in my life she dismisses it and then turns the conversation to her and her problems. I didn't for a long time have a problem with that, but over the last few years as my depression has gotten worse it's tiresome to be dismissed and then be asked to fix her problems. 

My father is arrogant to the extreme. I lived with him for a while to try to start a new life somewhere else. I didn't really successed there. I'm fairly certain he lynched someone. He has a noose, with the hangman's knot and a tattered cut about 3-4 feet from the noose, which he hung proudly in his office for years. His solution to everything when I lived with him was to drink, and it lead me to develop a heavy drinking problem for about 5 years. He blamed me, just as he blamed my sister, for drinking. 

When my parents got divorced I spent the week days at my mom's and the weekends at my dad's. Something strange about when they first got divorced is that I can't remember my bedroom in his apartment. I can remember everything else about it just not my bedroom. I don't have any memory of it, but I think this period is when I got raped for the first time. I always felt uneasy around my father, like something was just right and it was more than the noose (didn't learn about until I was 18), it was more than his day to day behavior, it's always just been a gut feeling. One of the last things my sister said to me before she died was that she had the same uneasy feeling about him and how she had thought she had seen it happening. 

When I went off to college I had this feeling of freedom, this feeling I could change everything. It faded quickly. I failed a lot in college, in high school I never studied and passed with a 3.5, in college I studied but could never retain the information nor fully understood the concepts. I thought I understood them, but essays were always returned with poor grades. It really started to sink in there that I wouldn't amount to anything, and that feeling has proven to be true. 

Since college I've worked countless job, and I've walked out or been fired from every one of them. These aren't office jobs, they're low paying jobs with no prestige. Pick and packer, bus boy, substitute teacher, just to name a few. The degree I got is absolutely useless, what kind of company is looking for a Political Science major with a minor in Anthropology and no reliable work experience. I know I should of chosen a different major, something practical, at the time I had a delusion that a degree meant I could get a job I wanted. 

Shortly after I graduated was when I believe I was raped again by my father. Again I don't remember the act, but I remember what it felt like waking up. It felt like I had been suffocated, like my face had been held into the pillow and it was hard to breathe and my face felt sore. My anus also hurt, it was swollen and it just felt like I had been penetrated, at this point I had experimented with anal play and I knew what it felt like to have had something up there. 

I've never had consensual sex. I've tried several times, but I get scared and then push them away or say something repulsive to make them lose interest. Consequently, I've never been loved by someone else. I don't really even know if I do know what it feels like to be loved. 

I think about suicide all the time, at this point its just a passing thought most the time like I should do the dishes, I should load the shot gun and just end it. Not long ago I was drinking and ended up telling my dad I was going to do it and I got sent to a mental institution for 5 days. They did nothing to help me there. 

It's hard for me to make friends, I've become bitter and angry at the world and can't connect to anyone. I just end up pushing them away. 

I don't really want to say anymore, I could probably write a book on it all. If you've made it this far that cool I guess. I don't want to die but I really don't want to live anymore.

Edit : I'm just going to get more out. When I was in college I started to have flashbacks of my early childhood. One that stood out was a hand reaching out to my face and a voice screaming "" faggot"" I have 4 scars on the left side of my face, all of them facing the same direction and all of them in a position suggesting they happened at the same time. I confronted my mom about it because it sounds like her voice, but she broke into tears when I suggested it and told me I got them when I was an infant from scratching my face. I don't know what to think about them or the 'memory' they're just something that has bothered me for a long time.

,SuicideWatch,"Sorry I'm just venting I guess but idk what to do. It's been several years and I haven't changed in fact now I'm just a depressed and lonely adult instead of an edgy teenager. I will never try hard enough to better myself so what's even the point. I'm not happy, I will never gain any sort of relationship. Im supposed to be my own person sure but then why should I care about friends or family if I shouldn't care about having a romantic partner. I just want to cut to the chase because all my life is going to ever be is play video games or some other wasting thing and sleep until I die but I am too afraid of dying.

,SuicideWatch,"Last week I was arrested for a DUI because I was driving 5 hours after smoking a joint. I was not even driving for 20 seconds before I was arrested and kept in a holding cell for 4 hours where I was then let out and allowed to drive again. I don't drink and I don't use any other drugs. Weed helps relax me and I would never smoke and immediately drive, I really do care about people.

I've been talking to friends and contacting lawyers but nobody understands the weight of the repercussions for DUI here in the UK. I will be banned from driving and I will have a criminal record.

In the past I have had mental health issues and have been in hospital twice for attempting to take my life. I managed to ""get over it"" with a lot of support from people and overcoming the hardships I had suffered. I made it my goal that I wanted to be a scientist and help people and I've been working on it for the past 5 years of my life since I did not get good grades in school as a result of my condition. Nonetheless, I told myself that I would learn pharmacology and I would work on helping people. I managed to achieve good grades and I've been searching for a job for the past year but now this will all be affected.

I feel like I've let myself down and I've let my family down. My father has had surgery in the past year and is disabled as a result of it and I drive him around everywhere, it kills me that I have let him down.  
I've worked so hard on building a good image and reputation within my community by helping others and now I will be labeled as a common criminal since I am involved with ""drugs"".

I've faced many challenges in life but this is too much. I've worked so hard to get to this point and it will be ruined by a punishment that outweighs the reality of the crime. Justice is not being served and the laws surrounding it are perverse and unjust. I know I dont deserve this but it is making me feel so shitty about myself.

I dont want to continue with life like this, it's unfair to have gone through all of this to receive this kind of treatment and punishment. My family dont talk to me the same, my friends dont know how I feel and now the world will see me as someone horrible regardless of the crime committed. Since I last attempted to end my life I was so lonely and had no one, it felt like a bottomless pit. But since then I have made it my duty to be there for anyone who might not have a friend or someone to talk to so that they never end up in the situation I am in. I feel like I have let them down too.

It feels extremely selfish of me to want to end my life but I don't see any other way out of this.

&lt;p&gt;In the past I have had mental health issues and have been in hospital twice for attempting to take my life. I managed to &amp;quot;get over it&amp;quot; with a lot of support from people and overcoming the hardships I had suffered. I made it my goal that I wanted to be a scientist and help people and I&amp;#39;ve been working on it for the past 5 years of my life since I did not get good grades in school as a result of my condition. Nonetheless, I told myself that I would learn pharmacology and I would work on helping people. I managed to achieve good grades and I&amp;#39;ve been searching for a job for the past year but now this will all be affected.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I feel like I&amp;#39;ve let myself down and I&amp;#39;ve let my family down. My father has had surgery in the past year and is disabled as a result of it and I drive him around everywhere, it kills me that I have let him down.&lt;br/&gt;
I&amp;#39;ve worked so hard on building a good image and reputation within my community by helping others and now I will be labeled as a common criminal since I am involved with &amp;quot;drugs&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve faced many challenges in life but this is too much. I&amp;#39;ve worked so hard to get to this point and it will be ruined by a punishment that outweighs the reality of the crime. Justice is not being served and the laws surrounding it are perverse and unjust. I know I dont deserve this but it is making me feel so shitty about myself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I dont want to continue with life like this, it&amp;#39;s unfair to have gone through all of this to receive this kind of treatment and punishment. My family dont talk to me the same, my friends dont know how I feel and now the world will see me as someone horrible regardless of the crime committed. Since I last attempted to end my life I was so lonely and had no one, it felt like a bottomless pit. But since then I have made it my duty to be there for anyone who might not have a friend or someone to talk to so that they never end up in the situation I am in. I feel like I have let them down too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It feels extremely selfish of me to want to end my life but I don&amp;#39;t see any other way out of this. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I can&amp;#39;t live with myself like this.&lt;/p&gt;

,SuicideWatch,"Hi,

I’m hoping that someone can relate to this as I can not express how I feel to anyone, so I’m an 28 years old, I have a decent job and have had a decent upbringing and social network of friends and family. So yeah perfect life right? So why do I think every day without fail if I could take a pill to end my life I would, even the good days I think about it. I have no idea if I have any mental illness as I have never seeked help. I have never attempted to end my life as I would not want my mother to go through any pain of me doing it or feel for any reason she may blame herself for my actions. From a young age I’ve have always had a feeling I would die young, I have times where I have spoke to friends and family recently about feeling low but brush it off as I don’t want people to feel like they need to check on me. I work in a hospital currently during the pandemic and I have no fear at all towards the virus. I constantly when I get a symptom of anything serious look it up to see if I have an terminal Illness and this may sound weird but I hope that I do, I think this may be due to the fact it could end my life without people having to question anything. I can’t help but feel selfish as I know people care about me yet I feel lonely. I feel extremely guilty for how I feel as I know people suffer much more everyday. It’s almost like I want to leave a room quietly without people watching me questioning where I’m going and not notice I’ve gone so it doesn’t affect their life and feelings.

Does anyone else have any similar feelings?

I do not want to offend anyone as I know everyone has their own reasons and may think I’m very selfish for how I feel and that I have a pretty normal life which a lot of people would wish for.

I constantly when I get a symptom of anything serious look it up to see if I have an terminal Illness and this may sound weird but I hope that I do, I think this may be due to the fact it could end my life without people having to question anything. I can’t help but feel selfish as I know people care about me yet I feel lonely. I feel extremely guilty for how I feel as I know people suffer much more everyday. It’s almost like I want to leave a room quietly without people watching me questioning where I’m going and not notice I’ve gone so it doesn’t affect their life and feelings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Does anyone else have any similar feelings?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I do not want to offend anyone as I know everyone has their own reasons and may think I’m very selfish for how I feel and that I have a pretty normal life which a lot of people would wish for.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thank you for reading if you have got this far...&lt;/p&gt;

I've recently develeoped a change where I have these anger outbursts, euphoria, mood swings, self harm, over indulge/ somewhat impulsive, attachment issues, empty, constant suicidal thoughts, etc. 

I'm not sure if I'm being overtly critical of my psychiatrist (who i might have grown to like a lot a lot since I've opened up to them.

I'm not listened to because no one cares.  I like to think I'm a good person but my mood is so angry or unnecessary.

Just like half the population my parents divorced. 

I come from very nice beginings of living in a drug house where I was neglected. Instability was amazing. At a young age, I was abandoned and left in the care of the other parent. I questioned if it was my fault. I learned that it was not just poor decisions on their part. 
Emotional abuse came with the transition of moving with the other parent which made me believe i was stupid. In a sense, i still believe this. 
Unknowingly, I was molested by a foster kid who was much older than I. I never felt so dirty. I lost my innocenece that day. 

That parent returned after all these years. Harsh punishment was enforced. I thought about suicide for the first time. Greatly considered it. 

The party doesn't stop! Then we were homeless (slept in cars) and had to sit waiting for days for food to come. 
I was a burden. I had a fucked up childhood and now being 24 it's just now hitting me. Ever since I was a kid, I dreamt of dying. Now it's all just now starting to weigh on me. I'm sick but to others I'm just a sad bitch who needs to toughen up...and I should. I'm overlooked because I can't speak my emotions when though I feel so many at once. 
I'm an adult with issues from childhood. It's pulling me back by my neck as I try to walk forward. After so long and so much effort to catch a single breath, I grow weak.

I was told that I have &amp;quot;Depressive disorder&amp;quot; i know I&amp;#39;m depressed but I&amp;#39;m sure it&amp;#39;s more since I&amp;#39;ve lived with it most of my years. I know something&amp;#39;s different.
I&amp;#39;m not listened to because no one cares.  I like to think I&amp;#39;m a good person but my mood is so angry or unnecessary.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just like half the population my parents divorced. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I come from very nice beginings of living in a drug house where I was neglected. Instability was amazing. At a young age, I was abandoned and left in the care of the other parent. I questioned if it was my fault. I learned that it was not just poor decisions on their part. 
Emotional abuse came with the transition of moving with the other parent which made me believe i was stupid. In a sense, i still believe this. 
Unknowingly, I was molested by a foster kid who was much older than I. I never felt so dirty. I lost my innocenece that day. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That parent returned after all these years. Harsh punishment was enforced. I thought about suicide for the first time. Greatly considered it. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The party doesn&amp;#39;t stop! Then we were homeless (slept in cars) and had to sit waiting for days for food to come. 
I was a burden. I had a fucked up childhood and now being 24 it&amp;#39;s just now hitting me. Ever since I was a kid, I dreamt of dying. Now it&amp;#39;s all just now starting to weigh on me. I&amp;#39;m sick but to others I&amp;#39;m just a sad bitch who needs to toughen up...and I should. I&amp;#39;m overlooked because I can&amp;#39;t speak my emotions when though I feel so many at once. 
I&amp;#39;m an adult with issues from childhood. It&amp;#39;s pulling me back by my neck as I try to walk forward. After so long and so much effort to catch a single breath, I grow weak. I fall to my knees to let it pull me to where it wants to go...and I won&amp;#39;t even care. I&amp;#39;m on a countdown.&lt;/p&gt;

,SuicideWatch,"Throwaway account, I need to get this out because I cannot tell anyone.

I am 26 (27 in 2 days) and my partner of 5 years has passed away from an aggressive and rare cancer called Cholangiocarcinoma (bile duct cancer) this week. He was 29. He was diagnosed whilst I was 35 weeks pregnant and our son is now 15 months old. In this time, the cancer had been surgically removed, he had received chemo and it had come back and spread significantly. The amount of pain he was in and seeing him deteriorate in the hospice which was supposed to be temporary was so awful for him and everyone involved. He was such a fighter, positive and such a popular guy. I am in so much emotional distress that I am in physical pain. I haven't eaten in 4 days since it happened. I haven't slept. I am almost always in tears and I am trying to plan his funeral.

I have a history of bipolar disorder (current depressive episode, surprise, surprise), an eating disorder which I'm relapsing into and anxiety. I feel awful for being suicidal. He would never want anyone to suffer, especially me. I feel our 15 month old will be better off with grandparents/god parents than having to live with myself. I have people who care. But the pain is too much for me to bare.

I have it planned for the night of his funeral, which by the way, we can only have 10 people at because of Covid. Immediate family, myself and his best friend. We don't know when the funeral will be but I am finding peace in the fact it will end soon. I can't tell anyone as I don't want to be stopped.

&lt;p&gt;I feel so fucking sad.  I pretend to be happy and just tonight I saw though this fake Vail I put infount of myself and others. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I want my family back together.  I want us all to be happy.  I miss evertone, I miss the games we use to play.  I miss wakeing up excited.  I miss the love I use to get from my family but now everyone can just bearly stand each other.  Everyone is disgusted each other.  I wish I had died.  I wished I could just had die though epilepsy complications and be remeber as a sweet child.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was told to put myself first but that just hurt everyone else.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I saw though the lies I tell myself and the lies I tell other. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Yes I&amp;#39;m getting better&amp;quot;. But yet no one asks the questions.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m going to go for a run and think about ending my life.  I&amp;#39;ve wanted to do it for a while but I just need to make my mind up.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m going to be honest I just won&amp;#39;t someone to see how I&amp;#39;m feeling.  Sorry poor sod.&lt;/p&gt;

,SuicideWatch,"I've been the kind my whole life to never give up. People have complimented that about me. I am good at endurance and enduring pain, but recently I have come to realize there is nothing worth enduring for.

The only thing I wanted in life was true love. I thought it existed. I wanted a friend, a companion, some one who could say I love you and will always be by your side and mean it. I know I could give the same. Some one who didn't want or expect some specific thing out of me. Money. Sex. Power. Whatever. Some one who just was fond of me and with me because I made them smile, made them laugh, brought them Joy.

I used to think sex was a side effect of love. That you did it with some one because you loved them and that if you both loved each other even if it was awkward at times it would be great and bring you both joy. Nowadays I'm learning the entire relationship is built around sex. Everything is about sex. If not sex, financial security, money, wealth. All that's legitimate and fine and good but what about loving some one because they are  a good friend? Because you find them cute and love to share life with them?

I'm learning this doesn't exist. If it doesn't exist what's the point? Even if some one has a ton of money and is a sexual gladiator, at this point knowing that's the reason they're with you, it feels... I don't know!? What's the point? My mind is starting to spiral. Every day just hurts so badly. I am trying hard to keep working, to keep exercising (I'm in great shape and plan to keep it that way!) but it's becoming unbearable. 

It's not that I want to die, it's that this is just some pointless fucking game and I don't want to play anymore. I always tend to screw things up too, in one way or another. I've never had anyone show me much patience or understanding in any way or help show me what to do. I want so bad to make some one happy, to be their knight in shining armor but I'm never good enough.

What do people do who aren't super sexual? Or who maybe were in a really bad relationship or had some sort of trauma at some point and didn't gain all the sexual experience needed? What if sex is kind of freaky to some one? What if some one just wants it to be a loving intimate thing between them and their partner and they don't have to worry about their performance? Why can't love just be about love and kindness? Do people who have been through these things not deserve true love?

I just want a partner, some one to share life with who won't constantly be judging me and carefully evaluating me at all times. This doesn't exist or is so rare I'll never find it.

I've tried so hard to hang on y'all but it just hurts y'know?

Idk anymore. It’s been about 6 months since we broke up. Still not over her, atleast that’s what the counselor says. I think she’s right too. Been thinking about her pretty much every single day, can’t even take her off my mind. Idk what it is that I’m feeling. It’s clearly not good that’s for sure. 

My mind keeps creating these scenarios. Like what if she goes with someone else. What if there is someone else making her laugh. What if she starts laughing at me with her friends or someone else she found. And all this is killing me on the inside. I can’t even fall asleep it’s so bad. It’s so hard to actually get into the rhythm of sleeping and when I do sleep I wake up in the middle of the night of some fucked up nightmare. I’m afraid to SLEEP. 

Maybe I need closure? Maybe I’m just afraid of getting with someone else or getting hurt again? Maybe this is really what life has to offer... idk how to stop thinking about her. How do I even move on? Literally everything reminds me of her, even music. I can’t even listen to music without dying on the inside. 

Sometimes I just think to myself I should just walk away from life. Maybe suicide? Or maybe I should run away, start a new life somewhere. I can’t even cry. For some reason I can’t cry. I envy those who do ngl

She was such a beautiful woman. Srsly she was and she used to say such random things that just made me smile. Well I mean I have her everything I had. I was willing to fix the issues but well she gave up on me. And you know I had hope that maybe in the future it could happen again? But even that’s gone now.

And to top it off, I don’t kill myself because of one good day when the bad days literally are fucking all the time because I think shit will change. The problem is me. I can’t change me. I can’t wait until I’m not afraid I really cannot. I’m so pathetic and I’m just a fucking dot on this tiny ass planet in this small universe that no one cares about yet I can’t even kill my useless self loathing self pitying self.  I’m such a damn coward.&lt;/p&gt;

,SuicideWatch,"Sorry, long post. Warning in advance. 

Not sure if it's this year of 2020 with all the events going on that is causing more feelings of depression but this has definitely been a very challenging year. Currently my wife is upset with me and this has been happening at least once a week since quarantine where there's one thing she'll get upset about and will stay mad and take it very personal. Whenever she feels upset, she gets hopeless in me and our marriage (we've been married for about 10 months in our late 20s so this is still new and been dating since 2016). I tend to start feeling hopeless in myself too and think about maybe I'm better off dying and letting her start over with someone else since we don't have any kids now to hold me back. 

I'll admit I am not the best at cheering her up and I usually need time to think it over before apologizing. She on the other hand wants me to work on it right away and be able to know what to say or do. Sometimes I feel she is being unreasonably upset and takes things too personally. There could be a bigger root to the problem to why she's this way I'm not sure. However, communication and me leading her has always been an issue in our relationship due to myself having social anxiety and just lacking communication skills overall. I have improved throughout my life but it is still something I want to improve on but at the same time it has been very difficult and I feel it's held me back in a lot of things in life such as relationships and jobs. 

The hardest thing is feeling like I don't belong in this world and that I may never belong. I thought getting a girlfriend and getting married would solve a lot of issues because at one point in my life I thought I was going to end up single forever so I would rather just die young than to suffer living alone. That is until I met my wife. Things were going well in the beginning and I couldn't be more happy to start my life with her and eventually start a family with her. Though it feels like a never ending cycle when she gets mad at me then the feelings of hopelessness comes and then we make up and feel better and I regret feeling that way then it happens again and back and again making me feel like I may never be good enough for her and she will feel like she settled for me or fall out of love from me. 

I do love her very much and can't imagine being with anyone else and I know she loves me too other than the times she gets upset. A part of me wishes at times that I never met her so I wouldn't feel as guilty offing myself and potentially scarring her. I wouldn't ever do it if I wasn't confident that she didn't love me anymore or if she ended up cheating one me. I also would feel guilty about hurting my parents and maybe other family members. I am not close with any of them and they all live in different states so I don't get to see my family often. I also have very few friends and no close enough friends to talk about these things to so that's why I am posting here. 

I am also at a point in my life where I should be having a career and when I compare myself to my peers, I feel so much less accomplished and less of value. I have a job but the pay isn't great and it's not something I see myself doing for very long. I have always had trouble with interviews due to my anxiety and have been rejected by over 100 interviews sadly. Fortunate that I could get that many interviews since my resume looks decent but my social skills kills me in doing well enough in interviews. I feel terrible when I compare myself to those who are more accomplished and doing better at life than me but then I feel guilty when I compare myself to those who have even less than me such as people who make much less money or those who are still single and alone. It makes me think about how why I feel I deserve more than them and why don't they deserve what I currently have? I hate feeling ungrateful about life. 

I am Christian so I believe in God and heaven. I know some people would say if you commit suicide, you're going to hell and others would say it depends and one mistake or sin in your life shouldn't define your life. I believe in the latter because you don't really know everything someones been through and maybe they didn't get the help they needed or feel they can't handle what they're going through anymore when they decided to take their life. For those who believe in God, you can debate all you want but in the end only God gets to decide. 

Finally, to let this off my chest since I don't know how I'll feel again the next day or week. I just feel I needed to post my thoughts and feelings of now. My plans were going to be hanging myself but I know there are chances that could fail and if I were ever going to go through with it, I would not want to fail at all. I also want to keep my body in tact so for any who cares can see me one last time before I'm buried. I would likely go through with using a suicide bag using helium or nitrogen since I would want something painless. I would also write a goodbye note to certain people in my life so they can have some type of closure on why I did it. 

To be honest I don't know if I will ever actually kill myself since I have days where I feel fine and feel I would never go through with it but this past year I have been thinking about it a lot more and have thought about wanting to die since high school. Meeting my wife helped me prolong my life but if our marriage ever completely failed then I don't know what to do with my life anymore and would not want to keep living.

,SuicideWatch,"Before I hear it I know everyone thinks it shouldn't matter but there's nothing that terrifies me more in like. I'm turning 24 and single. I'm a virgin too, look good, take care of myself, make good money but I really want a relationship.

But ever since I can remember I've been disturbed of getting close to a girl who's been with another guy. Just thinking of them being intimate together makes my skin crawl and I feel like vomiting.

This has made me afraid of talking to people because unless I know the girl is a virgin I'm constantly nervous.

I've managed to date one but it didn't work out but it was brief and we never did anything. And now I've been rejected by a girl who I know was a virgin and waiting for marriage which I would have totally done.


My friend joked yesterday that whoever I date will have ""had a train run on her"" and I'll have to get over it. When I snapped he apologized but I could barely breathe that night and spend it actually sobbing into my pillow and didn't get any sleep.

I'm so fucking nervous and I can't live like this. I've gone to years of therapy and they basically told me that the way I am I'll probably bot be able to get over it and since I didn't have any anxiety when I dated a virgin I should just do that.

But I'm single still and even if I date a younger girl they're still rare. I don't want to be alone my whole life but I know that I cant cope with her past, I will kms if I have to try.

I'm feeling so desperate especially after being rejected by my only girl who I both liked and was a virgin and covid destroying my already stagnant social life.

And what's worse nobody understands me and I'll probably just get told I need to get over it in this thread even though I've tried for years. 

I'm at a lot point and I'll do anything, I'll stop being afraid to socialize, I'll pay for dating help, sites,  talk to strangers. If I don't manage something in the next few years I'm going to completely break down. This is a nightmare to me, I really want affection and someone I can just hold them tightly but at the same time these feelings make me physically sick.

,SuicideWatch,"I'm sorry but my post might be all over the place. I grew up with an abusive father who used to beat me, but my father was always kind to my younger brother (3 years younger). When I turned 8 years old my father abandoned my family for another woman. My mother joined a church for emotional support and since then I was raised in a super religious upbringing.

This church turned out to be a cult. We had to distance from friends and family. They shamed people for having sex before marriage. They hammered the idea into out heads that planet earth was overrun by spiritual demons, they are in our rooms and everywhere, and we should avoid sin because we will go to hell. And they went really far to make us literally fear going hell every single moment. They would make us envision hell, make us watch documentaries of people that went to hell, show us paintings of hell. Taught us to fast (not eat) often as it would bring us closer to God. We weren’t allowed to watch movies, tv or cartoons/anime or listen to music (unless they were Christian), read non-christian books, comics, etc. Encourage parents/kids to not join school activities like sports, clubs, school dances because they have temptations of sins. The church also encourages us to not go to college because college is a place of sin and to devote our lives to the church after high school and get regular jobs.

Before I knew it my mom and myself became indoctrinated. I was already a loser in school growing up but now I was an even bigger loser because now I was the annoying Christian kid preaching to everyone. My brother didn’t buy the church stuff, he rebelled against my mother's teachings, and he ended up reconnecting with my dad and moving in with my dad. My dad didn’t want anything to do with me, he only wanted my brother. My dad said I'm the son he never wanted. My brother went on to become popular at his school, normal dating life, and eventually went to college.

After I graduated high school, I devoted my life to the church. I got a job at a factory and became a youth leader at my church. When I was 19 I started to become close friends with this girl at my church. Eventually, we started dating and we dated for 6 years. We never had sex, and barely kissed, the most we did was handhold or cuddle. When I was 25 years old I started to have doubts about my religion, and I ended up leaving my church, since then I am no longer religious, or agnostic-atheist. My GF at the time broke up with me for leaving the church, she eventually ended up marrying a guy. Around the same time, I lost my job at the factory and have been unemployed ever since.

Since then I had a hard time adjusting to a normal life. I never went to college or had a dream of my own because of the church. I never got to have friends, go to school dances, or date like a normal person, before church made me feel so ashamed of my sexuality. I was so scared of hell and demons, I even tried not to think dirty, I was supposed to even control my thoughts until marriage. I barely masturbated, I only masturbated a handful of times as a teen, and I haven’t masturbated again till I was 25 and I still feel guilty when I masturbate.

Now I’m a 26-year-old virgin, with daddy issues who never went to college, don’t have social skills, barely any money, and no friends at all. I barely have a personality of my own because for so many years I have lived for the church and my religion. With a bad personality like mine it’s already a set back in dating, and on top of that dating is already hard enough because I’m not attractive by society standards for males. I’m 5’5 with an unattractive face and I'm balding, I would have probably been 5’11 but the doctor told me fasting so often in my teen years stunted my growth and affected my facial bone development. I mean even my Ex-Gf said to me that she would have never been attracted to me if she wasn’t part of our church but that the churches teaching allowed her to see past my looks.

So these days, I get rejected a lot, both in-person and online dating for my personality, looks or height or social status or balding, and even the few times I got lucky and a few girls who were willing to give me a chance, the moment they found out I was a virgin they just assumed something was wrong with me and shamed me for being a virgin. I spend so many years being scared of sex I would not even know how to have sex with a girl.

I just feel like I have nothing to start with. I feel like I wasted my youth, wasted my time when I could have got a head start at college, never had a dream, never had a normal childhood. Now I struggle with being a 26-year-old virgin. Recently I even gained weight, I started eating emotionally because I'm avoiding drinking or using drugs and now I'm fat. I'm also dealing with health issues that make me feel testicular and groin pain and my knees hurt which makes me unable to walk for long, and doctors can't diagnose what's wrong with me. 

I just feel the hope keeps getting deeper. When I compare my life to my brother's life who’s the same age as me, I envy him. He’s 5’11, healthy, handsome, divorced parents but still has our dad in his life, was popular in school, played sports, went to school dances, always knew what he wanted to be, graduated and went to college, had a healthy sex/dating life, never had to deal with religion and had the freedom to find himself. My brother and my mom don’t understand my feelings, and my father doesn’t care about me. When I'm around my brother I feel so much envy and emasculated, I feel like I'm less of a man.

I feel I have everything going against me, and I lost so much of my youth and have nothing to start with, and feel romantically lonely and unattractive. I honestly feel like killing myself. I thought about selling all my stuff and donating all my money to a children's charity in my area and then killing myself. I'm not religious, but I sometimes hope I can be reborn into a different life. I just hope there isn't a hell because it would really suck that after all my earthly suffering now I have to burn for eternity just because I couldn't take it anymore.",t2_6qgl5lr2,False,,0,False,"I'm a 26-year-old virgin because of religious upbringing, abandoned by my father, never went to college because I devoted my life to my church, jealous of my more successful brother. I feel so lost. I feel like I have so much going against me.",[],r/SuicideWatch,False,0.0,,0,,False,t3_h0yiez,False,dark,0.93,,public,13,0,{},,False,[],,False,False,,{},,False,13,,False,,False,,[],{},,True,,1591907856.0,text,0.0,,,text,self.SuicideWatch,False,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m sorry but my post might be all over the place. I grew up with an abusive father who used to beat me, but my father was always kind to my younger brother (3 years younger). When I turned 8 years old my father abandoned my family for another woman. My mother joined a church for emotional support and since then I was raised in a super religious upbringing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This church turned out to be a cult. We had to distance from friends and family. They shamed people for having sex before marriage. They hammered the idea into out heads that planet earth was overrun by spiritual demons, they are in our rooms and everywhere, and we should avoid sin because we will go to hell. And they went really far to make us literally fear going hell every single moment. They would make us envision hell, make us watch documentaries of people that went to hell, show us paintings of hell. Taught us to fast (not eat) often as it would bring us closer to God. We weren’t allowed to watch movies, tv or cartoons/anime or listen to music (unless they were Christian), read non-christian books, comics, etc. Encourage parents/kids to not join school activities like sports, clubs, school dances because they have temptations of sins. The church also encourages us to not go to college because college is a place of sin and to devote our lives to the church after high school and get regular jobs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before I knew it my mom and myself became indoctrinated. I was already a loser in school growing up but now I was an even bigger loser because now I was the annoying Christian kid preaching to everyone. My brother didn’t buy the church stuff, he rebelled against my mother&amp;#39;s teachings, and he ended up reconnecting with my dad and moving in with my dad. My dad didn’t want anything to do with me, he only wanted my brother. My dad said I&amp;#39;m the son he never wanted. My brother went on to become popular at his school, normal dating life, and eventually went to college.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After I graduated high school, I devoted my life to the church. I got a job at a factory and became a youth leader at my church. When I was 19 I started to become close friends with this girl at my church. Eventually, we started dating and we dated for 6 years. We never had sex, and barely kissed, the most we did was handhold or cuddle. When I was 25 years old I started to have doubts about my religion, and I ended up leaving my church, since then I am no longer religious, or agnostic-atheist. My GF at the time broke up with me for leaving the church, she eventually ended up marrying a guy. Around the same time, I lost my job at the factory and have been unemployed ever since.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since then I had a hard time adjusting to a normal life. I never went to college or had a dream of my own because of the church. I never got to have friends, go to school dances, or date like a normal person, before church made me feel so ashamed of my sexuality. I was so scared of hell and demons, I even tried not to think dirty, I was supposed to even control my thoughts until marriage. I barely masturbated, I only masturbated a handful of times as a teen, and I haven’t masturbated again till I was 25 and I still feel guilty when I masturbate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now I’m a 26-year-old virgin, with daddy issues who never went to college, don’t have social skills, barely any money, and no friends at all. I barely have a personality of my own because for so many years I have lived for the church and my religion. With a bad personality like mine it’s already a set back in dating, and on top of that dating is already hard enough because I’m not attractive by society standards for males. I’m 5’5 with an unattractive face and I&amp;#39;m balding, I would have probably been 5’11 but the doctor told me fasting so often in my teen years stunted my growth and affected my facial bone development. I mean even my Ex-Gf said to me that she would have never been attracted to me if she wasn’t part of our church but that the churches teaching allowed her to see past my looks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So these days, I get rejected a lot, both in-person and online dating for my personality, looks or height or social status or balding, and even the few times I got lucky and a few girls who were willing to give me a chance, the moment they found out I was a virgin they just assumed something was wrong with me and shamed me for being a virgin. I spend so many years being scared of sex I would not even know how to have sex with a girl.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I just feel like I have nothing to start with. I feel like I wasted my youth, wasted my time when I could have got a head start at college, never had a dream, never had a normal childhood. Now I struggle with being a 26-year-old virgin. Recently I even gained weight, I started eating emotionally because I&amp;#39;m avoiding drinking or using drugs and now I&amp;#39;m fat. I&amp;#39;m also dealing with health issues that make me feel testicular and groin pain and my knees hurt which makes me unable to walk for long, and doctors can&amp;#39;t diagnose what&amp;#39;s wrong with me. &lt;/p&gt;

I've been suicidal for months (and not for the first time in my life) and I think about killing myself every day. I've made plans but I'm afraid to follow through.

I came across the concept of ""chronic suicidal thoughts."" one thing that kept coming up in articles and blog posts: that it's not an emergency or a crisis if someone has chronic suicidal thoughts. if someone tells you they're experiencing such thoughts, you shouldn't worry because it's just how they are.

suicidal ideation is only a crisis if it's a one-off or acute, sudden desire that just needs to be managed for a little while until it goes away.

the rest of us - people who have suicidal thoughts for months or years - are just supposed to live with it until eventually it kills us, because ""it's not an emergency.""

the articles and posts kept reiterating that suicidal thoughts are ""a comfort"" or ""a coping mechanism"" for people who have them chronically, because they like the idea of just being able to tap out eventually.

but... this isn't a comfort to me. I don't like thinking about suicide every day. I don't like planning how I can kill myself, how to leave instructions anything that needs taken care of, etc.

I don't want to kill myself the way someone wants to take a vacation.

I want to kill myself the way an animal wants to chew off its own leg to escape a trap.

it's not comforting. it's agonizing. I don't want to feel like this or have these thoughts.

but ""it's not an emergency."" apparently it's not a crisis or anything to worry about until I'm hours away from carrying out my plan or actively doing it.

by the time I reach that point, it'll be too late.

&lt;p&gt;but &amp;quot;it&amp;#39;s not an emergency.&amp;quot; apparently it&amp;#39;s not a crisis or anything to worry about until I&amp;#39;m hours away from carrying out my plan or actively doing it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;by the time I reach that point, it&amp;#39;ll be too late.&lt;/p&gt;

,SuicideWatch,"I should point out that this is all strictly referring to my own depression. It's very probable that other people's depression is more treatable and lives more likely to be fulfilling than my own. 

------------

David Foster Wallace said ""The so-called ‘psychotically depressed’ person who tries to kill herself doesn’t do so out of quote ‘hopelessness’ or any abstract conviction that life’s assets and debits do not square."" But DFW never met me. 

It's a fairly simple idea, I think. Getting better is hard, and requires constant upkeep. That is, of course, assuming it is possible to get better at all. I've tried numerous pills from all major modern anti-depressant families, plus an atypical anti-psychotic. When you've taken that many, it's not likely that the solution lies in any current pill. If I did try again though, next on the docket would likely be one last shot at an SSRI. If that didn't work the next step would be MAOI's and ECT, neither of which I'd do, the cure being worse than the disease. After that it's pretty much ketamine, which I can't afford.

But, supposing that I did, in fact, luck out and find the miracle combination of pills. For starters, there'd be the question of side effects. Most likely some weight gain and sexual dysfunction. Liveable, annoying but liveable. Still, pills alone likely wouldn't be enough to really spin my life around so I'd need to further improve my diet and exercise (I've already upped in my attempts to fight depression on my own, to no avail. Still, I prefer to be skinny rather than not so keep at it.) and likely see a therapist. Nothing I particularly enjoy, and to be honest doubt I would even if medication helped my depression a great deal. I just don't particularly care for exercise and such.

Speaking of not particularly caring; the next thing would be employment. I'm currently unemployed now, collecting disability. I don't particularly mind being a leech, but it's probably not great for me, mentally. Alright, well I'm really only qualified for unskilled labor positions. God I hate them, and I sincerely doubt that even curing my depression would make me enjoy it. Coming into work everyday being paid peanuts to deal with people and having know-nothing bosses worried about the bottom line of a company that literally doesn't know they exist. No, I don't think I could handle that.

But ultimately, where else could I go? Even if I did go back to college, I have no passion and no particular desire to do any kind of work that requires a college degree. The closest thing I have to a passion is video games. So, just for the sake of argument, let's suppose that curing my depression gives me some passion and I follow my childhood dream of becoming a game designer of some description, getting my degree in either graphic design or digital arts or programming or whatever else. Ok great. Time to join the literal worst job industry on the planet, with 80 hour work weeks, no unions, and low wages. Sounds like fun.

Well, if option A is back to college and option B is no college and unskilled labor, I guess I could always go with option B, skilled labor. Of course, if have to support myself with an unskilled labor job while I get my certifications. OK, trade school is cheap, jobs are plentiful, pay us pretty good and well protected... But even still, just the very nature of work itself seems to vex me. 40 hours a week doing tasks I don't care about for people I don't care about with co-workers I don't care about. I don't believe this is caused by the depression, I've been pretty apathetic since I was a kid, but I acknowledge it could be.

OK, so, let's assume I choose option B and I find the work acceptable. Now my options are thus: do I want to be deeply lonely and not get a girlfriend, or try and play the annoying social game of trying to find and keep a girlfriend. Both have their benefits and draw backs but honestly I don't know if I'd call either option preferred. Unless I got a girlfriend and she was really great, in which case it would probably be worth it. Still, this seems unlikely.

Then, there is simply the mere act of existing. Maintaining my life to the best of my ability. Keeping those around me happy. Being social. Watching my family grow old and die. Having to deal with people and things I do like. Of course, with my depression cured there will be good times too. Things I'll enjoy. Moments of happiness.

But, from my current position, I don't think those moments are worth it. They don't seem to outweigh the baggage. That is even assuming the statically best possible scenario. A scenario that, as I've pointed out is pretty unlikely in the first place. The numbers just don't add up in life's collum. 60 years of an average life just doesn't seem worth living. 60 years of this life, certainly not.",t2_6k9s3o9f,False,,0,False,I genuinely don't think that it's even worth it to try and get better anymore.,[],r/SuicideWatch,False,0.0,,0,,False,t3_h0xmcx,False,dark,0.92,,public,10,0,{},,False,[],,False,False,,{},,False,10,,False,,False,,[],{},,True,,1591904083.0,text,0.0,,,text,self.SuicideWatch,False,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;I should point out that this is all strictly referring to my own depression.

Still, pills alone likely wouldn&amp;#39;t be enough to really spin my life around so I&amp;#39;d need to further improve my diet and exercise (I&amp;#39;ve already upped in my attempts to fight depression on my own, to no avail. Still, I prefer to be skinny rather than not so keep at it.) and likely see a therapist. Nothing I particularly enjoy, and to be honest doubt I would even if medication helped my depression a great deal. I just don&amp;#39;t particularly care for exercise and such.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Speaking of not particularly caring; the next thing would be employment. I&amp;#39;m currently unemployed now, collecting disability. I don&amp;#39;t particularly mind being a leech, but it&amp;#39;s probably not great for me, mentally. Alright, well I&amp;#39;m really only qualified for unskilled labor positions. God I hate them, and I sincerely doubt that even curing my depression would make me enjoy it. Coming into work everyday being paid peanuts to deal with people and having know-nothing bosses worried about the bottom line of a company that literally doesn&amp;#39;t know they exist. No, I don&amp;#39;t think I could handle that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But ultimately, where else could I go? Even if I did go back to college, I have no passion and no particular desire to do any kind of work that requires a college degree. The closest thing I have to a passion is video games. So, just for the sake of argument, let&amp;#39;s suppose that curing my depression gives me some passion and I follow my childhood dream of becoming a game designer of some description, getting my degree in either graphic design or digital arts or programming or whatever else. Ok great. Time to join the literal worst job industry on the planet, with 80 hour work weeks, no unions, and low wages. Sounds like fun.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well, if option A is back to college and option B is no college and unskilled labor, I guess I could always go with option B, skilled labor. Of course, if have to support myself with an unskilled labor job while I get my certifications. OK, trade school is cheap, jobs are plentiful, pay us pretty good and well protected... But even still, just the very nature of work itself seems to vex me. 40 hours a week doing tasks I don&amp;#39;t care about for people I don&amp;#39;t care about with co-workers I don&amp;#39;t care about. I don&amp;#39;t believe this is caused by the depression, I&amp;#39;ve been pretty apathetic since I was a kid, but I acknowledge it could be.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;OK, so, let&amp;#39;s assume I choose option B and I find the work acceptable. Now my options are thus: do I want to be deeply lonely and not get a girlfriend, or try and play the annoying social game of trying to find and keep a girlfriend. Both have their benefits and draw backs but honestly I don&amp;#39;t know if I&amp;#39;d call either option preferred. Unless I got a girlfriend and she was really great, in which case it would probably be worth it. Still, this seems unlikely.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then, there is simply the mere act of existing. Maintaining my life to the best of my ability. Keeping those around me happy. Being social. Watching my family grow old and die. Having to deal with people and things I do like. Of course, with my depression cured there will be good times too. Things I&amp;#39;ll enjoy. Moments of happiness.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But, from my current position, I don&amp;#39;t think those moments are worth it. They don&amp;#39;t seem to outweigh the baggage. That is even assuming the statically best possible scenario. A scenario that, as I&amp;#39;ve pointed out is pretty unlikely in the first place. The numbers just don&amp;#39;t add up in life&amp;#39;s collum. 60 years of an average life just doesn&amp;#39;t seem worth living. 60 years of this life, certainly not.&lt;/p&gt;

&amp;#x200B;

I am not sure if everyone has these thoughts, maybe everyone wishes they weren't here on the inside. Either way, I am looking for advice. 

&amp;#x200B;

I have been thinking about suicide for a year now and I need it to stop. I feel this way because of school mainly, my mum is a doctor so obviously there is lots of academic pressure, she got 12 As in her GCSEs and 4 A\* in A levels and I often think to myself that there is no way I can possibly live up to her in any way, this resulted in me putting myself under lots of pressure to succeed in exams, often not letting myself eat if I got below a C, and to be fair to myself, I did see results, but at the cost of my mental health.

Furthermore, my house doesn't have any farther figure because he left a few years ago to start a new life in Australia and after reading the studies I concluded that this plays a large part in these feelings. School feels as tho it is slowly eating away at me. My school utilizes the cruel practice of 'streaming' which is the idea that students should be grouped tother based on academic performance, with little regard for the well-being of the students who will be labeled as at the 'bottom'. It is hard to be motivated to wake up 5 days a week to go to school, knowing that you are at the bottom. A dunce. 

In a world where anyone can be anything, it seems diabolical that such a dystopian system can be put into practice while being unscrutinized. The schooling system in the U.K is not only cruel but dehumanizing particularly to those who may under-perform. 

As many may know, right now is exam season in the U.K, which has led to me having these dark thoughts in record numbers, and I am scared that one day, I might just crack under the pressure and end it all. But at least for now, I recognize that it would be a foolish thing to do.

If I am complaining about nothing (Which there is a high chance I am), just tell me to stop complaining and shut the f\*\*\* up. But I still need advice on how I can exit this dead-end of destructive thoughts and mannerisms before its to late to turn back. 

My final thought concludes that we all have people and things to live for, amazing memories that deserve to be remembered for years to come and new experiences that no matter your current situation, will happen one day soon. We just need to be reminded of that sometimes. Which is why I turn to you.

,SuicideWatch," Hi I am 39 years old I am tired of living through life like this I'm on disability the unable to work because of PTSD severe chronic depression severe social anxiety which makes working nearly impossible to be around others and just to be able to try to do a job I also have dyslexia and learning issues which make working even harder especially if it's something I've never done before. Companies don’t want someone who is really slow at trying to learn and who has no education.

I have a tooth that needs to be recrowned and its the #19 tooth, I had the #30 tooth same spot on the right side removed and if I get #19 removed, I won't be able to chew as it is the only tooth I have I can really chomp down on food and yet I can't afford the $1200 for a new crown on it so I have no option but to get it removed for $400 

I have spent show years trying to get my GED, and I have spent many years trying to get a job my own place a vehicle and a good woman to love me. I have lost my parents when I was in my early twenties I only knew my dad for a few months before he passed away when I was 23, when I was 25 I lost my mother I don't know if it was from suicide or if it was from health issues.

I have no family no friends, what can we do have they don't want anything to do with me or I don't want anything to do with them because of how toxic they are to me. I have spent many years homeless and have been through a lot of stuff and seeing things nobody should see. I am currently renting a room from a sixty-year-old woman and if she dies I will end up back on the streets.

I have been trying to find a place to live I've been called up for several apartments low income, but every time it comes time for me to take one something comes up that keeps me from being able to get into one. I bought a car a few years ago and got scammed out of $2,000 to USD. I've been trying to save for another car but every time I do something comes up that takes my savings  or pushes me further in debt.

For the past 10 years I have applied for jobs never had an interview, I have spent trying to get my GED  and have been unable to. I've had tutors I've had teachers,  I have had study groups and one-on-one sessions. but even with all of this I have not been able to get my GED my education is on a second and third-grade level in almost every subject and I have to learn from 2nd grade to 12th grade I can't do that.

I spend my time watching movies, TV shows, listening to music, I don't even have a game system so I can't even play video games which I actually used to enjoy doing. It's been years since I've played a video game I can't afford the consoles or the games. and the computer I have is not strong enough to be able to hold video games or to be able to handle playing video games.

I used to enjoy fishing camping used to enjoy archery, I even used to go bowling every other Friday night which I can't do anymore either. I even used to love going to the golf courses and hitting up the golf ranges and just shooting a bucket of golf balls I found it peaceful and relaxing but I can't even afford that. 

I have done many things for work which was cash under the table and it was all manual labor. I have done everything from fixing fences building concrete slabs building porches building staircases as well as building walls and fixing holes in the walls even putting in new flooring or replacing flooring. I have done many other things as well as boxing for a few months I drove a semi-truck for a few months but my anxiety gets so bad to the point I could even drive them anymore. I can't do the work I used to do because of arthritis in my lower back and rheumatoid arthritis in my knees and feet.

I consider myself weird and nerdy by I consider myself a homebody but I do like going out time to time that prefers to stay home. I have put myself out there in the dating scene for over 8 years, during those eight years I've had women catfish me pretending to want to be with me, leading me on as they loved me. then they would fake their death on me or they would just ghost me. I have had women telling me I was a joke worthless useless had nothing to offer a relationship and I shouldn't even be loved and no one would want to be with me.

I have been trying to build myself a life and been trying to get on my feet but every time I do things come up that keep me down and knock me back down and I just can't keep doing it anymore. it feels like every breath I take is just razors cutting through my lungs attracting me apart inside. I am tired of struggling to breathe. I am tired of trying to fight to build something out of my life. I am tired of spending every waking moment of my life alone single unloved unwanted.

All I wanted was to find a woman to love me and accept me and treat me right. I don't ask for much just a simple life, all I want is just one or two friends a nice woman my own apartment and a vehicle that's it. but it feels like I'm trying to reach to live on Pluto and it's like it's trying to ask for a billion dollars and to become the president of the whole world.

I am tired I am worn out I am exhausted I have nothing left in me to give nothing left in me to fight I can't do it by myself anymore alone no support no one helping me constantly fighting and fighting and getting nowhere except right where I was when I started to try to fight to build something I can't do it anymore so today when a woman that I rent bedroom from leaves I will end up ending my life.

&lt;p&gt;I have a tooth that needs to be recrowned and its the #19 tooth, I had the #30 tooth same spot on the right side removed and if I get #19 removed, I won&amp;#39;t be able to chew as it is the only tooth I have I can really chomp down on food and yet I can&amp;#39;t afford the $1200 for a new crown on it so I have no option but to get it removed for $400 &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have spent show years trying to get my GED, and I have spent many years trying to get a job my own place a vehicle and a good woman to love me. I have lost my parents when I was in my early twenties I only knew my dad for a few months before he passed away when I was 23, when I was 25 I lost my mother I don&amp;#39;t know if it was from suicide or if it was from health issues.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have no family no friends, what can we do have they don&amp;#39;t want anything to do with me or I don&amp;#39;t want anything to do with them because of how toxic they are to me. I have spent many years homeless and have been through a lot of stuff and seeing things nobody should see. I am currently renting a room from a sixty-year-old woman and if she dies I will end up back on the streets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have been trying to find a place to live I&amp;#39;ve been called up for several apartments low income, but every time it comes time for me to take one something comes up that keeps me from being able to get into one. I bought a car a few years ago and got scammed out of $2,000 to USD. I&amp;#39;ve been trying to save for another car but every time I do something comes up that takes my savings  or pushes me further in debt.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the past 10 years I have applied for jobs never had an interview, I have spent trying to get my GED  and have been unable to. I&amp;#39;ve had tutors I&amp;#39;ve had teachers,  I have had study groups and one-on-one sessions. but even with all of this I have not been able to get my GED my education is on a second and third-grade level in almost every subject and I have to learn from 2nd grade to 12th grade I can&amp;#39;t do that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I spend my time watching movies, TV shows, listening to music, I don&amp;#39;t even have a game system so I can&amp;#39;t even play video games which I actually used to enjoy doing. It&amp;#39;s been years since I&amp;#39;ve played a video game I can&amp;#39;t afford the consoles or the games. and the computer I have is not strong enough to be able to hold video games or to be able to handle playing video games.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I used to enjoy fishing camping used to enjoy archery, I even used to go bowling every other Friday night which I can&amp;#39;t do anymore either. I even used to love going to the golf courses and hitting up the golf ranges and just shooting a bucket of golf balls I found it peaceful and relaxing but I can&amp;#39;t even afford that. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have done many things for work which was cash under the table and it was all manual labor. I have done everything from fixing fences building concrete slabs building porches building staircases as well as building walls and fixing holes in the walls even putting in new flooring or replacing flooring. I have done many other things as well as boxing for a few months I drove a semi-truck for a few months but my anxiety gets so bad to the point I could even drive them anymore. I can&amp;#39;t do the work I used to do because of arthritis in my lower back and rheumatoid arthritis in my knees and feet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I consider myself weird and nerdy by I consider myself a homebody but I do like going out time to time that prefers to stay home. I have put myself out there in the dating scene for over 8 years, during those eight years I&amp;#39;ve had women catfish me pretending to want to be with me, leading me on as they loved me. then they would fake their death on me or they would just ghost me. I have had women telling me I was a joke worthless useless had nothing to offer a relationship and I shouldn&amp;#39;t even be loved and no one would want to be with me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have been trying to build myself a life and been trying to get on my feet but every time I do things come up that keep me down and knock me back down and I just can&amp;#39;t keep doing it anymore. it feels like every breath I take is just razors cutting through my lungs attracting me apart inside. I am tired of struggling to breathe. I am tired of trying to fight to build something out of my life. I am tired of spending every waking moment of my life alone single unloved unwanted.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All I wanted was to find a woman to love me and accept me and treat me right. I don&amp;#39;t ask for much just a simple life, all I want is just one or two friends a nice woman my own apartment and a vehicle that&amp;#39;s it. but it feels like I&amp;#39;m trying to reach to live on Pluto and it&amp;#39;s like it&amp;#39;s trying to ask for a billion dollars and to become the president of the whole world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am tired I am worn out I am exhausted I have nothing left in me to give nothing left in me to fight I can&amp;#39;t do it by myself anymore alone no support no one helping me constantly fighting and fighting and getting nowhere except right where I was when I started to try to fight to build something I can&amp;#39;t do it anymore so today when a woman that I rent bedroom from leaves I will end up ending my life.  I just have nothing left to live for and nothing left to do and nothing left in me.&lt;/p&gt;

,SuicideWatch,"Introduction: I have ***NEVER, EVER*** attempted suicide my whole life *(and I won't ever seriously consider actually attempting it)*, **BUT** suicidal thoughts will be triggered in me whenever I'm faced with major event milestones that cause stress. Sometimes I wish I want to live forever thanks to the existence of good things (for me, it's games, music and some YouTube channels plus good memories), but when bad things get ""overwhelming"" (e.g. stress of coping from no school to kindergarten, kindergarten to primary/elementary, high school to university, and in a few years, university to working life, not to mention increasing responsibilities in the family AAAGH) I wish I was dead earlier even before I experienced the suffering.

Now, to the points of the title. I'm sure absolutely nobody wants stress, right? But guess what, it's been drilled into us in regular doses with virtually no break from it. Let's start from childhood: People who can afford school got forcibly sent into school and they wish they could just stay at home or go to fun places and just relax like it's the holiday breaks. What about the people who couldn't afford school and just stayed at home everyday? They had to do household chores or help in the family business. School's got peer and academic and maybe familial pressure too, while household chores would probably contain a very intense amount of familial pressure, idk because I'm never been *that* broke, maybe I should watch more documentaries about uneducated peasant life. But anyway, even though the activities are totally different, both are stressful. ***Either way, stress is inevitable.*** But then you also have nice privileges such as lots of playtime, mischievous moments and pranks, as well as a sense of wonder and awe towards the world!

Fast forward to teenagehood, you get things like stress and confusion from puberty, peer pressure, family pressure, societal pressure, academic pressure... It's all stress and pressure. Imagine a life without stress/pressure-- Wait, that's impossible! *But even so, wouldn't it be nice to experience a purely positive life sheltered from stress?* ***Wait, nope, too late, never possible.*** But then you also experience nice feelings such as falling in love, the ability to finally go out yourself (but still with parental (dis)approval, usually), the maturity for more difficult hobbies/skills and appreciation of deeper media.

And speaking of adulthood, you now bear a LOT more responsibilities including college/university, bill payment, a full-time workload, and if applicable, taking care of your partner and/or children and making sure that they also get an upbringing that isn't all free from any form of stress, because apparently *(read: unfortunately)* [life *isn't* supposed to be a nice easy pure utopia.](https://thoughtcatalog.com/lauren-jarvis-gibson/2017/01/life-isnt-meant-to-be-easy-and-if-it-is-then-youre-doing-it-wrong/) Boo. ***Nobody's free from stress!*** (Tons of other articles about why life isn't easy also say pretty much the same thing.)

,SuicideWatch,"Suicide was a concept that came early to me. Whenever my mom wanted something she couldn’t get, she’d threaten to kill herself. This led to my father marrying her and divorcing her in the long run. 

Ever since I was 9, I constantly wished I was never born. I still do. I see no way my existence has made it better for anyone but one person. If this one person never became such a good friend of mine I probably would’ve been dead a long time ago. But he’s moving to New York in a few months (I live in Oregon) but even then we’ll probably still be talking a lot. 

I guess what I’m saying is that my life has only positively affected one person. If I was never born, my family’s lives would be so much better. My brother might’ve been a functioning person in society. My dad wouldn’t be so stressed, wouldn’t have heart problems. My mom wouldn’t have to live her life knowing that her “daughter” that she’s always wanted is a transgender excuse of a 5’2 man. 

I feel like I’m not worthy of anything. Of love, of friends, even something as insignificant as my tv. This is largely because of my body. I feel so small. Physically and mentally. I feel like a waste of space. I’m weak. I have no power over myself. I have stretch marks on my hips because there’s so much fat on them. My hands are so small that I can hardly even hold a dodgeball or hold a controller right. 

And most of all, I don’t even know if I’m a man. I feel like it’s who I am but with the way that everyone clearly views me, I feel like I can never see myself for who I am. Even just the fact that I’m already this far in my transition makes me sick. I hate being transgender. But it’s significantly less painful than the thought that I would be stuck living as a girl forever. Still, I hate that I’ve had to resort to this. 

People claim they’re supportive, and I’m grateful, but they’re also honest. Only when I’m alone I feel the most like myself. But when someone else sees me, it’s beyond obvious that I’m not, nor never will be, born male. 

Even just me saying this makes me feel worse. I know that I’ll always be small. I know that no matter how many things I change, I’ll have always been born in a female body. 

Now comes to my final point. The discomfort I’ve felt for so long has never gone away. Physical discomfort translates into mental discomfort. Too many things to list affect me every single day. 

Discomfort is something everyone gets. But when it’s every minute of every day, constantly occupying my mind, it becomes unbearable to the point of pure hopelessness that I’ll never be liberated, then to the thought that suicide is the way out. 

I’m not depressed anymore. I was from age 9 to 14. But I can’t tell if I’m happy. I tell myself that I am but I feel like I’m lying. 

I see a lot of potential in myself. I’ve always been an artist and I really want to get into game development. I can see myself taking that path. But I also easily see myself failing. I have a list of things I need to do before I die. The first on the list is to see whether or not I fail or pass. Then from there, the list continues into personal projects.

,SuicideWatch,"I've struggled with anxiety, depression, and suicidal thoughts for nearly my entire life. I was doing relatively well for a short amount of time, but then around Christmas last year, I took a nosedive and became the most messed up I had been in years. I cried constantly, reverted to constantly thinking about killing myself, the works. It got so bad that I started neglecting my college work and skipping out on classes because I couldn't pull myself out of bed.

&amp;#x200B;

I ended up signing up for counseling at school and didn't have any insurance to see an actual therapist. I had all of 3 sessions before the whole coronavirus thing hit. I didn't get to talk to my counselor anymore because everything shut down for a while and classes moved online. I ultimately had to drop out of school for the spring semester because my classwork was too far gone. The pandemic has been absolute hell on my anxiety disorder. I still fight with panic attacks any time I have to leave my house.

&amp;#x200B;

I have a muscular injury that prevents me from standing for more than 20-30 minutes at a time or else I can't walk without extreme pain. I don't have a job right now because of this so I've basically been sitting at home since mid-December while my mental state has crumbled to basically nothing. My partner has done all the work and I've just sat around siphoning off of her like a fucking parasite. I don't know why she puts up with me or how she could still love me after how royally I've screwed us. She's the only good thing I really have and I don't deserve her.

&amp;#x200B;

We were told this past weekend that we were going to lose our house. The tl;dr of it is that it is situated on the same property as the landlords' home, and they informed us that they needed the house for their own family reasons. We have 30 days to pack up and get out, give or take. They were nice about it and all and even wrote us a letter of recommendation because we've never been late on rent and aren't bad tenants, but that doesn't change how bad of a position they've put us in.

&amp;#x200B;

Our credit is shit and we have no money. There are no other rental properties in the area that we could move into on such short notice, and even if there were, I don't think anyone is going to take us in with how terrible our credit scores are (both are below 500 right now). My parents have told me that I can crash with them until we find another place, but my partner is not welcome since they are pretty homophobic. I don't think living with them again will be very good for my mental state. It was hell living with them before and even though they've gotten better over the years and continue to improve, I still don't know if I'll be able to handle being back under the same roof as them. My partner's family's house is already packed to the max but they may have a room opening up soon since her brother just joined the army and is supposed to be shipping out to boot camp in August. I don't really want to be a burden on them though and even though they like me and support our relationship, I'm not sure if I would be allowed to stay with them in addition to my partner. I certainly don't feel comfortable inviting myself, especially since I don't really have a way to contribute to the household.

&amp;#x200B;

I feel like the walls are closing in on me and that it would just be better to give in and kill myself. I'm almost 29 years old and my life hasn't amounted to anything but crippling debt and constant mental anguish. I haven't slept properly in months. I feel like I'm just dragging my partner down with me and that she deserves so much better. My family deserves a better daughter than the shitty one that I've turned out to be. I've been fighting to continue life for over 10 years now and I'm so tired. I don't know why I keep fighting it. I don't know why I keep managing to cling onto life when doing myself in would just fix everything. Pragmatically speaking, I feel like I should just pull the trigger and get it over with.

&amp;#x200B;

The biggest problem is that even in death, I'd still just be a big burden on everyone I care about. I don't want my partner to come home and find my brains splattered all over the place. She doesn't deserve that. She's already going through enough. I scared her yesterday because I had a bad breakdown and didn't respond to her messages while she was at work. I don't want to burden her or my family with the outrageous costs for a funeral/burial, either.

TL;DR: Persistent inflation in my country is ruining my life and leaving me desperate even though I ""technically"" shouldn't be in this shit.

I've been dealing with a lot of shit in the last few years and I've managed to handle it to some extent, but now I see every little possible hope around me dying and that's the worst...

It all comes to fucking inflation, something that I don't have the slightest control over. You go to bed thinking ""okay if I work for 4 months then I can somehow manage to change my broken phone or do X"" and then suddenly wake up the next day (well more like a few months than days in reality as we're still a bit far from hyperinflation) with prices doubled...

I've been a good student, going to to best middle/high-school in my city, graduating the best university in my country as a rank 1 student, and now accepted in a kinda high-on-demand and more applicable field for my masters in the same uni also knowing 4 languages. My family is considered upper middle class (by here's standards of course) and I'm an only child with both parents working (I also take some part-time job plus some small scholarships here and there) YET I can't fucking spend a day without having to worry about money... All of my devices which I need for studying/work are starting to break all at once and I won't even be able to buy a damn mid-range phone let alone something better. Like buying a 2k PC here means having to spend all you earn as a university PROFESSOR for 5 fucking months. And that would be only if your fucking currency won't lose much more of its value... And it's not all about those fancy foreign products I even have to worry about food and cloths these days...

Funny thing is that back when I was in middle school I could afford a high-end phone just by saving for like a year...

I see no fucking light here, I mean sure I can afford food and shelter still but the thing is that things just keep getting worse and it's just a matter of time before I can afford any of those... And well being from a shitty country moving out would also be hell of an experience considering everyone else is also trying to do the same... Not to mention it will need loads of money which is almost impossible to pay due to this low value currency...

I have no hope for anything anymore, I just wanted to have a simple life attending to my hobbies and research without having to worry about all this shit but I guess that's a mere dream... I just want to get rid of this stress-driven uncertain life, and there ain't many options for that...

,SuicideWatch,"Hey, 22yo male here.

Well, I hate my body with all my heart. I don’t know what did I do to deserve this. Like its okay for people to have a few imperfections, but I literally consist out of them. 
As I said, I am 22 and I still struggle with acne. For some reason my fat is stored in my ass and thighs, even though my hormones are fine. So I look like a disproportionate piece of shit having skinny upper body and fatty lower body. On top of that, I cannot even balance it out properly as I hardly get any muscle from working out. The worst part is that my penis is barely 6 inches long (yea yea average my ass, my whole life I have never seen anyone having a dick smaller than mine). I have tiny wrists and hands just like female, though I am relatively tall (6’1“) which makes it look even more ridiculous. My voice is ugly, like I am a 14 yo who smokes a pack a day. I almost don’t have any facial hair. 
For the past few years I watched my friends grow up into decent looking men, meanwhile I stayed seriously behind. I am seeing therapist, but it honestly does not help at all, like how can I accept and love myself when I am such failure. 
I have not left home for the past 2 months. All I do is thinking all day how I have no future and how much I hate myself. I also think about suicide all the time, but lets be real I am a pussy and probably will never find courage to end it all.

&lt;p&gt;Well, I hate my body with all my heart. I don’t know what did I do to deserve this. Like its okay for people to have a few imperfections, but I literally consist out of them. 
As I said, I am 22 and I still struggle with acne. For some reason my fat is stored in my ass and thighs, even though my hormones are fine. So I look like a disproportionate piece of shit having skinny upper body and fatty lower body. On top of that, I cannot even balance it out properly as I hardly get any muscle from working out. The worst part is that my penis is barely 6 inches long (yea yea average my ass, my whole life I have never seen anyone having a dick smaller than mine). I have tiny wrists and hands just like female, though I am relatively tall (6’1“) which makes it look even more ridiculous. My voice is ugly, like I am a 14 yo who smokes a pack a day. I almost don’t have any facial hair.

Daycare hasn’t reopened and has no plans to reopen, but is still charging $75 a week to *not* teach or watch any kids.  

Spouse isn’t going to take any time off of work to give me even a one-hour break, and is going back to the office the *second* it reopens.  “I need this,” they told me.  “It’s for my mental health.  I just can’t stay at this house any longer.”

Looking for work is still impossible because there is no one to take care of the kid, and Spouse continues to sabotage the job search.  “Of course I can watch the kid” so I can do an interview becomes “I have a meeting” ten minutes before the call is scheduled.  Actual interviews get interrupted when the router “accidentally” gets turned off mid-call.  Recruiters who went to the same schools Spouse did *somehow* stop answering their phones or emails after alumni events I know Spouse attended. I am expected to believe a toddler somehow climbed into the closet and poured paint all over my interview suits in the closet while I was at the grocery store. 

Watching the kid isn’t going to get any easier.  Months and months and months of tantrums, of failed potty training, of screaming sleepless nights, of being called too fat and stupid to parent by everyone at the pediatrician’s office, of being coughed and sneezed and pissed and shat on, of having meals I prepared rejected and thrown across the room by two stupid assholes (only one of whom has the excuse of being under three) who refuse to eat it or anything else but complain that they’re still hungry.  No daycare, no breaks.  24 hours a day, 7 days a week.

And I ever complain about this, to anyone I know?  Then they remind me that I’m the asshole for complaining.  Because I don’t have a job.  Because I’m a leech.  Because I’m a breeder.  Because I don’t have enough kids.  Because I don’t like being a parent.  Because I don’t know how easy I have it. Because they have it worse.  Because other people have it worse.  

And Spouse hears about it all, and makes sure I hear it back.

EDIT: Hey mods, why can’t I say anything in my own defense without you removing my comments?

I see the mods have removed me standing up for myself in the face of an admitted troll, so here’s my takeaway.

Just ... the sheer *gall* it takes to read about four discrete instances of Spouse sabotaging my attempts to find literally any job—to the point where they poured paint over my interview suits and blamed it on a toddler who did not have access to any paint and could not have climbed that high in the closet—and then turn around and *take Spouse’s side* and call it “tough love” and then constantly demonstrate exactly the kind of abuse I get whenever I try to open up about my life and my feelings ...

im 19,

my parents are divorced, my grandparents own my college fund account, they didn't pay my summer tuition because they side with their son (my dad), my college is kicking me out of a class that I've already failed once and just wanted to wipe it all away by tryharding in the summer.. 

I'm a failure at everything I do, I'm good at math but as you see the economy isn't exactly the best place right now; I love to make music but I don't have the money to get it mixed or to buy tunecore or do anything to promote it / earn anything off of it in any way.

My mom doesn't believe in mental health issues; I'm self diagnosed paranoid-schizo. Not like I have the means to verify that; but it seems to emcompass my issues quite well.

I'm alone in this world; my brother steals money from me, my mom enables him to, and my dad is on the other side of the earth too drunk or high to care about anyone he may have known before his 50th birthday. 

I wish I had one opening; one shot. I seem to squander all my relationships because suburb folk aren't like city folk. My number one thing is respect; theirs is reputation; and they have no problem cracking some bones to bolster theirs. 

I have a girlfriend but I feel like she doesn't love me at all; She's always either angry about work or angry about waking up to go to work. I seem more like a journal, sometimes a sex toy to her, but not really a friend. When she starts conversation she expects it back; when I start it I'm met with a blank stare or literal silence followed by 15 seconds later ""huh?"".

im jaded by the whole thing. life in all of its 'glory'. none of it matters; no one is truly selfless; the ones that are will be leaving soon

When I do express myself and how I feel she doesn't listen anyway. No one cares. No one ever will. And I need to accept that. and I will; right after I finish tying this noose. Bye everyone, don't comment because I won't be logging back

,SuicideWatch,"This might sound stupid, but I have had suicide thoughts for a few years. It's been on and off and it's only thoughts, never attempts. I did better recently. I always knew I will never kill myself. I'm a smart person and can control myself in difficult situations.

But then 2 days ago, some miss understanding happen between me and my girlfriend. Without going into details, we quarreled a bit and her phone was off mid quarrel. I was in very bad mood that day as well, so bad timing of the quarrel. My previous girlfriend broke up with me and shut off the phone, leaving me sleepless the whole night.

So my girlfriend didnt break up with me, and it was all just a miss understanding and her phone went legit off due to low battery maybe, but I legit thought she was gone.

,SuicideWatch,"Hello, 19yo male here. I know I'm very young, but I don't really see how my life can improve from now on. TLDR: I made a bad decision about my studies, and I don't want to drag a life of regret.

In high school, I was a bright student, but I didn't know what I wanted to do with my life, as I was quite interested in everything. Also, studying, and education in general, was the most important thing to me; playing sports, seeing friends, playing video games: I got tired of it all very quickly, as I was already having so much fun in studying, and I really thought that you have to do well in your studies first to enjoy the other aspects of life (I understand that this is not everyone's vision, I don't impose it). Finally, I chose a selective educational establishment, that aims to prepare students to enter a good school in 2 years (a system specific to my country). But this choice was really fucking hard to make and I had hesitated a lot with another schooling (more science-based).

Got my high school diploma with a perfect grade, then began my schooling in September 2018. In fact, I soon realized, at least unconsciously, that I had little interest in most subjects being taught in the schooling I had chosen (these are subjects that I love to learn on my own, even at a high level, but not in an academic setting; I learnt it the hard way). But since I was a serious student, I didn't ask myself any questions and forced myself to work (also, it's a very intense schooling where you don't have too much time to think about anything else). But during these two years I was less and less efficient; in fact, I never really had the motivation to progress, from the first day, even if I didn't realize it right away, I was a bit like a spectator, behaving mechanically, unconsciously imitating my classmates. Deep down, I didn't care if I scored well or badly on the tests, even if, by lying to myself, I convinced myself that it affected me. I realize more and more that this is probably the other schooling I should have chosen. Useless thing to think about, right? But you don't choose what you think about.

I really feel like I've been a shadow of my former self during these two years and therefore that I've wasted my potential. I feel that I have betrayed myself, betrayed my parents, and all of those who believe in me... Actually, from an external point of view, I'm not doing so badly, I got pretty good grades (but also bad ones), but deep down I know I didn't give it my all, despite my efforts (but ""wanting to want"" is not something you can choose, I guess): it's that self-betrayal feeling that hits the hardest. I feel like I've lost my one true love, my passion for studying... *The higher you rise, the harder you fall*, right?

Now that I am condemned to do something I don't like, I feel empty, numb (I was from the beginning of my schooling, but the period of lockdown allowed me to think a little about myself, a rare thing, and made me realize it), trapped. I guess that's basically how most people live: doing something they don't really like. But I don't see the point. The problem is that there is no turning back, I can't choose the other schooling, and I will never be able to make up for those two years lost in procrastination, lack of ambition, lack of motivation, lack of discipline, lack of smart work (as I've said, I actually worked quite a lot but not as an active man, rather as a zombie, and for example, there's almost nothing in my long-term memory related to this training). Therefore, it is very logical that I have no future, as I'll live as a half-sleeping man. I don't see the point of recovering from a bad decision: what's the point of ""recovering"" if it's to live without energy? Some illnesses just can't be cured, and that's why physicians sometimes decide to turn off their patients' life support...

I won't try anything against myself as long as my parents live, as I don't want to hurt them, but when they die, I'll have nothing left to live for.

&lt;p&gt;I won&amp;#39;t try anything against myself as long as my parents live, as I don&amp;#39;t want to hurt them, but when they die, I&amp;#39;ll have nothing left to live for.&lt;/p&gt;

I’m going to try my best to explain what happened to me last night. So lately I’ve been worrying a lot and been under a lot of stress.

Everytime I tryed to close my eyes I thought that I was going to die it was that bad I felt like something was over me. I couldn’t yell for help or anything.

Ever since I was a kid, I've had issues with Body Odor. I am an adult now, and the BO issues are still with me.

,SuicideWatch,"Hello everyone, my name is Cedric (suppose it ain't impprtant anymore for me to put my name out here) and I'm from the Netherlands. Currently 28 years old, served in the army and am currently finishing my bachelor in social work :).

The thing is, I've been struggling with severe social anxiety, depression, panic attacks and suicidal thoughts. I also recently became homeless because after I was honorably discharged from the army, I went to school and stayed with my parents. Unfortunately, my conditions were too difficult for my parents to really understand and I really don't blaim them. It escalated and thats when I decided it was best to leave. I'm moving between the homes of my friends. But the title says it all. I'm putting an end to the missery in my head. It sounds drastic, but it's comforting to me that I won't have to deal with all the mess inside my head.
For the people seeking an explanation how it feels to deal with my conditions, I'll do my best to explain. 

First off, the anxiety. Imagine when you have a big test, an important play on stage, or when you have to have a job interview. Those nerves you have are pretty normal and somewhat healthy because it shows you care. It's that feeling of tingling/rollercoaster sensation that creeps up from your belly to your head. Let's take that feeling and apply that to much less important things throughout the day. For example, getting a message on whatsapp from close friends, doing groceries, going to the clothing store, putting something in the dishwasher the right way, walking in public. Almost everything you can imagine that involves other people, I get that sensation in my belly, stomach, chest and throat. You can imagine it's very tiring. 

When I go to sleep, that's when the real fun starts. I have nothing but my own mind to fuck with me and nothing to distract me from my destructive thought patterns. Imagine going to bed and already you feel sick in your stomach because you know you're gonna have panic attacks. My hands become sweaty, my heart starts pounding, I hyperventilate, lose my sense of balance, dissociate myself from reality and have restless muscles. This for about 3-4 times a night. It is an existential feeling of dread I cannot really explain. That feeling when you run up the stairs at home because you think something is going to grab you when you were a little kid. That, and then 100x worse. Again, pretty tiring.

With the combination that I also have sleep apnea, isn't helping my nights rest either. So every morning it feels like I'm strapped to my bed, but as soon as I wake up, the anxiety starts again. It's like: shit! I have to get out now, but I'm so tired! But everyone is counting on me to be there! But what if I am late?! Shit shit shit shit!!!! 

Give or take, I've dealt with that since I was 12 or 13 if I remember correctly. That's a long time being tired. In those years I've had some burn-outs and I don't think I've ever recovered from them. Around when I was 22, depression started kicking in. 

Depression feels like.. well it doesn't feel like anything. You could put me on the most fun trip of my lifetime, but I was just as content with that as laying alone sulking in my bedroom. Depression to me means that you can't feel anything. Nothing matters anymore. On top of that, for me at least, I felt so guilty because I had to lie to my closest ones that I was having fun, but in reality, it didn't do anything for me. I just was so tired and wanted to sleep. Such a long sleep that I didn't have to wake up anymore. I know I'm contradicting myself here a bit, but it's more like, if I ever felt something, it was something negative. Other than that, you're an empty shell walking the earth with the ever ongoing question in your mind: what even is the purpose of my efforts in this life? 

The thing is, I can imagine that my close ones would feel insulted when I say nothing really matters to me. That is an enormous guilt I'm carrying. Also something I cannot deal with anymore.

So, now I'm at wits end. Don't get me wrong, I sought help from professionals and close ones alike! Unfortunately, to no avail. I've had suicidal thoughts for over a year or 4 now, but never really acted on them. I've searched ways to end my life as painless as possible, but then I thought to myself: the hurt I'm inflicting to everyone who cares for me, was enough to stop the act. Right now, it doesn't work anymore. 

I'm sitting on a quiet dike next to the canal of my hometown Middelburg. I'm going to record my final testimonies to every impactfull individual in my life because typing will be a problem at some point. 

Right now, as I'm sitting here, I'm drinking alcohol, taking an overdose of xanax in combination of eating grapefruit because that enhances the effect of the drug. If I go now, it will be in my sleep. I will send parts my coordinates to two different friends who can solve my puzzle. That way, they will find me the next day. 

Reddit has been a great experience to me :). You had the ability to take my mind of things and I am thankfull to you for that! 

I'm sorry if this post hits too close to your own homes, but this way, I hope people can learn from my experience :). 

I will take this thought with me:

Why should you be afraid of death? You were dead before you were born! With that logic, you return from whence you came! You're going home...

&lt;p&gt;The thing is, I&amp;#39;ve been struggling with severe social anxiety, depression, panic attacks and suicidal thoughts. I also recently became homeless because after I was honorably discharged from the army, I went to school and stayed with my parents. Unfortunately, my conditions were too difficult for my parents to really understand and I really don&amp;#39;t blaim them. It escalated and thats when I decided it was best to leave. I&amp;#39;m moving between the homes of my friends. But the title says it all. I&amp;#39;m putting an end to the missery in my head. It sounds drastic, but it&amp;#39;s comforting to me that I won&amp;#39;t have to deal with all the mess inside my head.
For the people seeking an explanation how it feels to deal with my conditions, I&amp;#39;ll do my best to explain. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First off, the anxiety. Imagine when you have a big test, an important play on stage, or when you have to have a job interview. Those nerves you have are pretty normal and somewhat healthy because it shows you care. It&amp;#39;s that feeling of tingling/rollercoaster sensation that creeps up from your belly to your head. Let&amp;#39;s take that feeling and apply that to much less important things throughout the day. For example, getting a message on whatsapp from close friends, doing groceries, going to the clothing store, putting something in the dishwasher the right way, walking in public. Almost everything you can imagine that involves other people, I get that sensation in my belly, stomach, chest and throat. You can imagine it&amp;#39;s very tiring. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I go to sleep, that&amp;#39;s when the real fun starts. I have nothing but my own mind to fuck with me and nothing to distract me from my destructive thought patterns. Imagine going to bed and already you feel sick in your stomach because you know you&amp;#39;re gonna have panic attacks. My hands become sweaty, my heart starts pounding, I hyperventilate, lose my sense of balance, dissociate myself from reality and have restless muscles. This for about 3-4 times a night. It is an existential feeling of dread I cannot really explain. That feeling when you run up the stairs at home because you think something is going to grab you when you were a little kid. That, and then 100x worse. Again, pretty tiring.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With the combination that I also have sleep apnea, isn&amp;#39;t helping my nights rest either. So every morning it feels like I&amp;#39;m strapped to my bed, but as soon as I wake up, the anxiety starts again. It&amp;#39;s like: shit! I have to get out now, but I&amp;#39;m so tired! But everyone is counting on me to be there! But what if I am late?! Shit shit shit shit!!!! &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Give or take, I&amp;#39;ve dealt with that since I was 12 or 13 if I remember correctly. That&amp;#39;s a long time being tired. In those years I&amp;#39;ve had some burn-outs and I don&amp;#39;t think I&amp;#39;ve ever recovered from them. Around when I was 22, depression started kicking in. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Depression feels like.. well it doesn&amp;#39;t feel like anything. You could put me on the most fun trip of my lifetime, but I was just as content with that as laying alone sulking in my bedroom. Depression to me means that you can&amp;#39;t feel anything. Nothing matters anymore. On top of that, for me at least, I felt so guilty because I had to lie to my closest ones that I was having fun, but in reality, it didn&amp;#39;t do anything for me. I just was so tired and wanted to sleep. Such a long sleep that I didn&amp;#39;t have to wake up anymore. I know I&amp;#39;m contradicting myself here a bit, but it&amp;#39;s more like, if I ever felt something, it was something negative. Other than that, you&amp;#39;re an empty shell walking the earth with the ever ongoing question in your mind: what even is the purpose of my efforts in this life? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The thing is, I can imagine that my close ones would feel insulted when I say nothing really matters to me. That is an enormous guilt I&amp;#39;m carrying. Also something I cannot deal with anymore.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, now I&amp;#39;m at wits end. Don&amp;#39;t get me wrong, I sought help from professionals and close ones alike! Unfortunately, to no avail. I&amp;#39;ve had suicidal thoughts for over a year or 4 now, but never really acted on them. I&amp;#39;ve searched ways to end my life as painless as possible, but then I thought to myself: the hurt I&amp;#39;m inflicting to everyone who cares for me, was enough to stop the act. Right now, it doesn&amp;#39;t work anymore. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m sitting on a quiet dike next to the canal of my hometown Middelburg. I&amp;#39;m going to record my final testimonies to every impactfull individual in my life because typing will be a problem at some point. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Right now, as I&amp;#39;m sitting here, I&amp;#39;m drinking alcohol, taking an overdose of xanax in combination of eating grapefruit because that enhances the effect of the drug. If I go now, it will be in my sleep. I will send parts my coordinates to two different friends who can solve my puzzle. That way, they will find me the next day. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Reddit has been a great experience to me :). You had the ability to take my mind of things and I am thankfull to you for that! &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m sorry if this post hits too close to your own homes, but this way, I hope people can learn from my experience :). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I will take this thought with me:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Why should you be afraid of death? You were dead before you were born! With that logic, you return from whence you came! You&amp;#39;re going home... &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Love, Cedric :)&lt;/p&gt;

,SuicideWatch,"I'm a (17M) and I know I'm young but I hate being alive. My distain for being alive started when I was a kid and it has only grown more intense over the years.

 I'll cut to the chase, I have been planning my suicide for years now. When I turn 18, on my birthday I will have a third-party drive me to another state. I will bring a gun and do the deed in a motel. It seems simple but that's just who I am.

 I have been surrounded by good people my whole life. I have a loving mother, a caring stepfather, two loud and lovable brothers and the family dog. My life is by no means perfect, but I'm with the people I love.

 When I was 8 my brothers and I, had to live with our deadbeat, drunkard, abusive, toxic, manipulative, drug addict, lazy, cruel and narcissistic biological father. I, as the oldest tried my hardest to protect my brothers from him. As such, I took the brunt of the abuse. After about a year living with my biological father I involuntarily steeled my emotions. I moved far away from him after 3 entire years of having to shield my brothers from him. It was around then when I felt different.

Due to me involuntarily becoming emotionally distant, I had nothing left that could bring me joy. I had lived through 4 straight years of abuse and my brothers were fine. He's no longer in our lives, I was happy. Things never got better though. I never had any friends growing up because of my cynical views on life. I'm almost an adult and I'm unemployed, unmotivated, suicidal (and I have no way to convey my emotions to others) I have a minor learning disability, an eating disorder and I'm riddled with intense anxiety.

I think I'm a broken human being. The death of the older sister and baby brother I never got the chance to know weigh heavily on my mind. I waste my time slowly becoming more like the father I hate so much. I don't want to end it because I love the people around me, but I can't live like this. No one should live like this, it's cruel. To suffer though 4 years of abuse, to then suddenly be surrounded by good people. To live as the only broken human in a house of smiling people.

 I can't even cry, do you know what it's like to have so many awful emotions and no way of releasing it? I love the people around me, but I hate my life. I'm not asking for help, I just want someone to hear me. I want to know that if no one around me understands me, at least I tried. And that's all I can hope for really.

I tried my best to type out how I feel, sorry if I didn't do a good job of it. That's all.

I have very dark suicidal thoughts. It all connects to feeling unloved or unlovable. Not just romantically, but via friendships and family.

Last year I graduated from high school, 365 days ago. It has amazed me how just 365 days can change so much of yourself. In that time I've gone to the maritime academy of my dreams, lost my girlfriend, and my school burnt down (long story). Seeing how much I've changed over the last year really makes me reflect on who I am, who I was, and possibly who I might become.

But, reflecting also dredges up bad memories and some

*close calls*

It was junior year of highschool when I began to not be ""in the game"", and sidelined myself in life. I had just gotten my first job that summer, and I was working my way through fall semester. I found work easy at school and would find myself on my phone to help pass the time  in class. With new rules the school district was really cracking down on phones in class and writing people up for it. Naturally as well, this didn't follow through well when I would receive detention from school and my parents would hear about it.

To me, my parents image of me was everything, it was the whole reason I worked hard in school. And when that image took a beating so did I. I was so toxic to myself about almost every little thing.

*Fucking kill yourself*
*You stupid piece of shit, can't even remember to bring a pencil*

Those were real thoughts of mine that I wrote in a sort of journal I kept during this time.

Between Thanksgiving and Christmas break I racked up 7  ""cell phone violations"", 2½ hours of detention later I ended up at home.

 First my parents took so much of my toys ( truck, phone, no bed time, had to wake up by a certain time, etc.), but what was worse was the phycological beat down I would give myself. To put it simply, it was BAD. Looking back I fear that part of myself, how bitter and heartless I could be to myself still bewilders me to this day.

I swore that if I got another detention I would kill myself. What scares me is the seriousness in the thought, I just couldn't deal with the demons in my head anymore. This was just as Christmas break began so I knew I would at least spend a ""last Christmas"" with my family to see if it was worth it to stick around.

I lasted untill January 26th, 2018.

I remember the phone call to the office, what it meant, and why I was there. I remember the clouds outside, and how the conversation with the man went in a blur. I remember the yelling, the demeaning and the embarrassment of my parents. And I remember then, the hopelessness I felt.

But then what came next was far worse

I went to school the next day and somberly went through the day, and when I got home my parents weren't.

I looked for almost an hour for some way to finish it, end it all, and rid my waste of flesh from the world.

And then it hit me,

Cars go fast and my truck had no airbags

I went back to the front door and grabbed my keys, my wallet, and a pack of fruit snacks. Just as I stepped out the door I saw my mom coming down the driveway.

In the fleeting moment of panic I dropped every plan I had for the night in fear of being labeled suicidal if I was discovered.

That night was the hardest phycological battle I've ever fought. I just couldn't stand myself anymore, so I fought back. I would write in the journal I had and furiously fight myself, pages and pages. I would fall asleep and wake up only to write more. Spilling things so vile from my mind into those pages I dare to ever read again.

But that night I scared myself terribly, I had mutilated the caustic and poisonous person I became. It was that night that I told to myself, *not yet bitch*

It took months but it got better, I re-evaluated my priorities, changed my habits, and really found myself again.

To say again in case you can't read:

 THIS TOOK MONTHS

And I am an enormously better person than that 17 year old me could've ever hoped to be. 

A friend once said to me, 

""The worst is the worst, it dosent matter how bad it is but if it's the worst you've ever seen, then it's the worst""

Everyone has their own struggles, some worse than others and I want to say and I'm also very happy to say, this was my worst. I have seen the toxicity of a mind and the betrayal of yourself. I've been there, and I'm open to talk about it. If there's something you have to share,

PLEASE DO.   
SOMEONE IS THERE, YOU JUST HAVE TO LOOK.

To put it simply, it was BAD. Looking back I fear that part of myself, how bitter and heartless I could be to myself still bewilders me to this day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I swore that if I got another detention I would kill myself. What scares me is the seriousness in the thought, I just couldn&amp;#39;t deal with the demons in my head anymore. This was just as Christmas break began so I knew I would at least spend a &amp;quot;last Christmas&amp;quot; with my family to see if it was worth it to stick around.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I lasted untill January 26th, 2018.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I remember the phone call to the office, what it meant, and why I was there. I remember the clouds outside, and how the conversation with the man went in a blur. I remember the yelling, the demeaning and the embarrassment of my parents. And I remember then, the hopelessness I felt.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But then what came next was far worse&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I went to school the next day and somberly went through the day, and when I got home my parents weren&amp;#39;t.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I looked for almost an hour for some way to finish it, end it all, and rid my waste of flesh from the world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And then it hit me,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cars go fast and my truck had no airbags&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I went back to the front door and grabbed my keys, my wallet, and a pack of fruit snacks. Just as I stepped out the door I saw my mom coming down the driveway.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the fleeting moment of panic I dropped every plan I had for the night in fear of being labeled suicidal if I was discovered.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That night was the hardest phycological battle I&amp;#39;ve ever fought. I just couldn&amp;#39;t stand myself anymore, so I fought back. I would write in the journal I had and furiously fight myself, pages and pages. I would fall asleep and wake up only to write more. Spilling things so vile from my mind into those pages I dare to ever read again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But that night I scared myself terribly, I had mutilated the caustic and poisonous person I became. It was that night that I told to myself, &lt;em&gt;not yet bitch&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It took months but it got better, I re-evaluated my priorities, changed my habits, and really found myself again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To say again in case you can&amp;#39;t read:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;THIS TOOK MONTHS&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And I am an enormously better person than that 17 year old me could&amp;#39;ve ever hoped to be. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A friend once said to me, &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;The worst is the worst, it dosent matter how bad it is but if it&amp;#39;s the worst you&amp;#39;ve ever seen, then it&amp;#39;s the worst&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Everyone has their own struggles, some worse than others and I want to say and I&amp;#39;m also very happy to say, this was my worst. I have seen the toxicity of a mind and the betrayal of yourself. I&amp;#39;ve been there, and I&amp;#39;m open to talk about it. If there&amp;#39;s something you have to share,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;PLEASE DO.&lt;br/&gt;
SOMEONE IS THERE, YOU JUST HAVE TO LOOK.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;TL:DR, Suicide attempt that was stopped before it started, ever greatfull it was.&lt;/p&gt;

His parents are even worse, when I tried to tell them literally ANYTHING I wanted to achieve, they laughed at me and talked me out of it. I'm sick of it, why the heck would I try to work for something, if it never payed off in the end. The only thing left in my life is acting and when I can't get into drama school, there's nothing left for me. Acting is the only interest I have, there is nothing else I would wanna do. Nothing else I will do because even if I had to work at some other place, in the end of the day I would do nothing. I'm just useless to my parents, my family as a whole, my friends and what not. I will never be able to improve myself because I never had to, so now I can't really learn it. I hate to be taught, but I hate teaching things to myself. And I know that sounds like the most stupid excuse for not doing anything, but if that is in excuse my ""mind just made up for me"" I don't know what it says about me. Probably just, that I'm an asshole, who's just ungrateful. 

I want to become something, but I can't wait anymore. I hate all that waiting, because I never had to wait and I hate that all this is just whining how I was ""never properly raised"" and how no one ""taught me how to live"". I hate it, because I'm just putting the blame, that I'm a useless, lazy dickhead, on others. I'm sick of it and sick of myself. But guess what: I won't change. I perfectly know, that something won't go as planned, that it won't happen overnight and that will make me lose my temper and I'll quit whatever I'm trying. It's always been this way. I just hate it. And at this point I hate that apparently that's the only thing I'm capable of. Just whining. I don't wanna exist anymore, but people will feel bad. I literally only live for others at this point, so they won't feel bad. I don't know what I'm waiting for at this point. When I don't get into drama school in the next 5 or so years, I might as well end it. But as you already know, my chances are almost none. I just lost hope about everything, my career, myself and that I will ever find someone to be with. I hate it, that I always lose my temper, when something doesn't go the way I want it, I'm just a huge baby. I just hope I get hit by a car or something, so other's won't feel so bad. I really don't know, why I should still life, other than this ridiculously small chance of getting into drama school.

Everybody always says that I will find someone to be with someday. Yeah right, it's not like every good trait I have, everyone else has too. There's literally nothing I'm particularly good at and nothing that's compelling to anyone. I'm just uninteresting. And the thing is, subconsciously I think that ""when I find someone someday, I'll finally have a reason to carry on"" and I know that that's simply not true. I'll have to love myself first, before I can live someone else but I'll never love myself. What for? My attitude? That I'm blaming others for ruining my life? That I'm wasting any ""talent"" people told me I had? That I have such a short temper, that I can't stick with anything? That I'm ungrateful as hell for all that I have? I'm just a piece of shit. I hate it. And I don't have any motivation to change that at this point. Friends have been reaching out to me, offered to help my through therapy and what not, but I always just decline and say ""I'll manage"". No, I won't. I'll stay like this forever. Why can't I just accept their offer? Am I too proud? Too stupid? Or am I just attention seeking? Honestly, i sometimes really feel like it, bothering people with my feelings, but as soon as they offer help, I decline. I'm always just whining, without trying to change something. I don't want to live anymore because it always just comes back to me realizing, that I'm trash. That I'll never become something and I'll always just bother people. I will always realize, that I'm gonna die alone with that attitude, so why don't I just end it now, while I have friends? Because I seriously think that there's still a chance. I somehow really believe that all this is just something, that comes with being a teenager, that I'm just whining, should just grow up and learn to work for something. Well, too bad, I'll probably never will, because I'm lazy and stupid and stubborn and ungrateful and just a huuuuge dickhead overall. That one thing people always say is that ""the world is a better place with you in it"", yeah, if sure is with a wimp like me, who can't do anything right. And the worst thing is, that I still complain about my life, while so many people have it much worse.

That was all just a giant rant I wanted to let go, I repeated myself several times, but yeah. I was probably also missing a lot of points. I honestly don't know why I post this, maybe just a small part of me thinks that someone or something can really cheer me up or motivate me. And there already have been a few people on reddit, who talked to me and while I really appreciate their support, nothing really clicked to me at this point. Or maybe I'm just attention seeking, if so, it's probably better if I died. I honestly don't know, what's going on in my head at this point and it feels like I'm just deceiving myself with lies and what not.

,SuicideWatch,"Honestly I can't even dream properly anymore.

If you asked me what future I would like I would have no answer. I'd like to be dead, so that I don't have a future. If you offered me a billion dollars or death, I'd just take death. I just want to disappear.

Being alive sucks and it has always sucked. I feel like I've had to just lie to myself about being happy some of the time because I'm not always 100% miserable and just to try and make things bearable.

There's a scary thing that happens if you grow up in pain and never know happiness. It's just your baseline. It's just your normal. And you ""adjust"" but when I realized that having adapted to suffering wasn't the same as actually feeling okay, it sort of tears your whole world down. My whole life hasn't been worth the trouble.

It would really make a difference if my mother cared about me, but she didn't and doesn't, and I can't change that. But I don't know how to make up for it. I don't know how to recover from that idea, that my own mother doesn't love me, how could I be worth anything? I know that's irrational but I can't shake it.

There's honestly not that much love in the world. You have to find it, compete for it, earn it. Otherwise you just disappear.

I'm not really that useful to the world. I'm not the most useless person ever, but the world doesn't seem to really need me. I could die and history will proceed exactly the same. The people in my life who don't forget about me immediately, they'll die eventually too.

,SuicideWatch,"Halfway through my 20s, I am divorced, unemployed, living at home. My days are spent trying not to fall asleep, usually failing. I have no motivation, because there's nothing I can gain. I can apply for jobs, but that doesn't make them hire me. I can try to sleep, but that doesn't fix my energy. I can try dating apps or whatever, but that doesn't mean anyone will love me. I can try to think positive, but that doesn't change my reality.

My life has no intrinsic value. I've been sitting here for hours, and I cannot come up with a single quality that gives my life inherent purpose. My value only extends insofar as I can add value to other people. This is my purpose? To sit here all day doing nothing, desperately trying to make myself an asset to the world?

My health issues will worsen with age. I've been plagued by tinnitus and other ear problems as long as I can remember. I'm in a state of perpetual exhaustion because my body doesn't get enough oxygen while I sleep. I've had chronic dizziness for 4 years. My mind is unable to focus, even with adderall. All of this gets worse with age. I've done nothing with my years so far, and life only gets worse.

Depression isn't sadness. It isn't anger. In fact, it isn't anything. It's the absence of feeling. It's a black hole in your chest that sucks any emotions into it. It's a feeling of hollowness, of emptiness. I try to watch a disturbing movie, full of torture and despair. Just to shock me, to strike my soul with ANY emotion. Good or bad, I just want to feel. But my soul remains empty, a black vessel on a voyage to nowhere. It goes in circles. It wears on my mind. It drains my heart. It's chronic emotional exhaustion that I can only take for so long.

What people don't get about suicide is that it isn't an indictment of the support system the person has. It isn't a statement about what people were doing wrong and what they could've done instead. Suicide isn't saying I add no value to the world. It's A Wonderful Life is flaming bullshit that fundamentally misunderstands the issue - George shouldn't commit suicide because he saved the family bank? What if they didn't survive the bank run? Would his life be less valuable? Does the reasoning to stay alive boil down to a list of things that would have gone differently if I weren't around?

No, suicide is exhaustion. Exhaustion with my daily life, exhaustion with fighting my own brain, exhaustion with the hell I put myself in, exhaustion with trying to find a better future that I don't believe exists. It's the release of a breath held so long you feel as though you'll faint. It's the acceptance of my life. It's the realization that I was dealt a shitty hand, and folding is my only option. You can only bluff your way through so many rounds.

I deal with 4 mental disorders and 2 chronic physical conditions, taking a medication cocktail every day to try to keep myself sane. It isn't fucking working. My sleep apnea keeps me exhausted, my ADHD stops me from being productive to fix it, and my depression keeps me locked in this cycle of hopelessness. The other disorders just got thrown in for fun I guess. If there is a God that is meant to give me purpose, he made me from leftovers, from faulty equipment that couldn't be used elsewhere.

I'm not going to fucking kill myself. I don't WANT to kill myself. I physically can't do it. But I want life to be over. I've had enough now, I'd like to get off the ride please. I'd like to go to sleep and stay asleep. I don't want to kill myself. I just want to... not be alive anymore.

But I will wake up tomorrow. I'll wake up exhausted, as I always do. I'll talk to my therapist at our weekly 10am wednesday appointment, and assure him I'm not at risk for self harm. Because I won't be. This raw clarity leaves me as I sleep, and tomorrow I am once again convinced by the illusion that my life has purpose. I'll do that phone interview at 11:30am, knowing full well that it will not lead to anything. Then I'll have the rest of the day to find reasons I should remain alive. 

And what I feel tonight won't last. I'll feel better tomorrow. I may feel better in 30 minutes. I may even feel better in 30 seconds. Because that's how it works. But all I've done is restart the process. I'll pretend to have purpose for a while, convincing myself that life is worth living.

&lt;p&gt;What people don&amp;#39;t get about suicide is that it isn&amp;#39;t an indictment of the support system the person has. It isn&amp;#39;t a statement about what people were doing wrong and what they could&amp;#39;ve done instead. Suicide isn&amp;#39;t saying I add no value to the world. It&amp;#39;s A Wonderful Life is flaming bullshit that fundamentally misunderstands the issue - George shouldn&amp;#39;t commit suicide because he saved the family bank? What if they didn&amp;#39;t survive the bank run? Would his life be less valuable? Does the reasoning to stay alive boil down to a list of things that would have gone differently if I weren&amp;#39;t around?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No, suicide is exhaustion. Exhaustion with my daily life, exhaustion with fighting my own brain, exhaustion with the hell I put myself in, exhaustion with trying to find a better future that I don&amp;#39;t believe exists. It&amp;#39;s the release of a breath held so long you feel as though you&amp;#39;ll faint. It&amp;#39;s the acceptance of my life. It&amp;#39;s the realization that I was dealt a shitty hand, and folding is my only option. You can only bluff your way through so many rounds.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I deal with 4 mental disorders and 2 chronic physical conditions, taking a medication cocktail every day to try to keep myself sane. It isn&amp;#39;t fucking working. My sleep apnea keeps me exhausted, my ADHD stops me from being productive to fix it, and my depression keeps me locked in this cycle of hopelessness. The other disorders just got thrown in for fun I guess. If there is a God that is meant to give me purpose, he made me from leftovers, from faulty equipment that couldn&amp;#39;t be used elsewhere.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m not going to fucking kill myself. I don&amp;#39;t WANT to kill myself. I physically can&amp;#39;t do it. But I want life to be over. I&amp;#39;ve had enough now, I&amp;#39;d like to get off the ride please. I&amp;#39;d like to go to sleep and stay asleep. I don&amp;#39;t want to kill myself. I just want to... not be alive anymore.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But I will wake up tomorrow. I&amp;#39;ll wake up exhausted, as I always do. I&amp;#39;ll talk to my therapist at our weekly 10am wednesday appointment, and assure him I&amp;#39;m not at risk for self harm. Because I won&amp;#39;t be. This raw clarity leaves me as I sleep, and tomorrow I am once again convinced by the illusion that my life has purpose. I&amp;#39;ll do that phone interview at 11:30am, knowing full well that it will not lead to anything. Then I&amp;#39;ll have the rest of the day to find reasons I should remain alive. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And what I feel tonight won&amp;#39;t last. I&amp;#39;ll feel better tomorrow. I may feel better in 30 minutes. I may even feel better in 30 seconds. Because that&amp;#39;s how it works. But all I&amp;#39;ve done is restart the process. I&amp;#39;ll pretend to have purpose for a while, convincing myself that life is worth living. But eventually, tonight will come again.&lt;/p&gt;

,SuicideWatch,"So I guess I started going to therapy in around October of last year. I started going to a private service first, which meant I had regular appointments, but obviously the service had to be paid for. I was later moved to a free mental health service run by the government. It started off with a group therapy thing that lasted for a few weeks, every Wednesday. I’m still with that service, just having one-on-one sessions, although since it’s a free service, my appointments are less regular and are usually separated by weeks, I might get one appointment per month, and now, for obvious reasons, the appointments have now been moved to phone calls.

I don’t really think therapy is actually helping me at all. I don’t understand why I want to commit suicide, I’ve never been through any sort of traumatic event that MADE me feel like this, I just sort of do. The phone calls usually only last about ten minutes max, and they’re always the same conversation. She asks me questions, I’ll say either ‘yes, no, I don’t know, etc’, because there’s literally nothing to actually SAY. I just feel like therapy has had an almost negative effect on me.

Like the other day, I was actually enjoying myself, I was watching stuff on Netflix and I was able to almost forget I was even really a person, and then my therapist calls, immediately it ruins my day by reminding me of my suicidal thoughts by asking ‘do you still have thoughts about not wanting to be alive anymore?’ And of course I do. I think about suicide almost all the time because it feels like there’s NOTHING left to live for. She asks the question and I say yeah, and that’s just sort of it? Like what’s even the point in her asking me that because it never feels like she actually does anything to help me, she just REMINDS me of it and then goes ‘oh okay 🧚‍♀️✨’. I know it’s not her fault, I know that’s her job, but it’s not really helping at all.

My sister also called me a schizo for going to therapy, and my mam thinks I should be cured by now and over the whole therapy thing. It feels like people look down at me for going. I want to give it up because I’ve been trying this for months now with three different therapists, from the private, to group to this service, and it has done nothing but remind me that I simply hate being alive and that there’s probably no way I’ll ever not feel like that.

I think about suicide almost all the time because it feels like there’s NOTHING left to live for. She asks the question and I say yeah, and that’s just sort of it? Like what’s even the point in her asking me that because it never feels like she actually does anything to help me, she just REMINDS me of it and then goes ‘oh okay 🧚‍♀️✨’. I know it’s not her fault, I know that’s her job, but it’s not really helping at all.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My sister also called me a schizo for going to therapy, and my mam thinks I should be cured by now and over the whole therapy thing. It feels like people look down at me for going. I want to give it up because I’ve been trying this for months now with three different therapists, from the private, to group to this service, and it has done nothing but remind me that I simply hate being alive and that there’s probably no way I’ll ever not feel like that. I know if I give it up, it’ll probably take maybe years to get back into this free mental health system again, but since it’s not working, I don’t think I should continue going.&lt;/p&gt;

,SuicideWatch,"I’ve thought about it a lot, but I never made plans to do it. And I know what I’m about to share is immensely fucked up, but I need to get this off my chest.

I grew up in a super dysfunctional home and I’ve felt isolated from everyone else for as long as I can remember.

The worst age was 14. I was in an abusive relationship, my parents were emotionally and physically abusive, teachers wrote me off and other students bullied me. I had almost no friends and my body was covered with cystic acne.

Looking back, I also probably had some form of depression, anxiety or ADHD. The symptoms were apparent, but nobody was willing to get me the help I needed.

I’ve been thinking lately that I should have just swallowed an entire bottle of Tylenol in the locker room or a bathroom. Everyone would have known about it and felt bad about it, and I could have forced the adults in my life to provide what I needed.

I didn’t want to die back then, per se, but I knew even then that the life I had was miserable and I wanted it to change.

I know this is fucked up, but I feel like I could have had a shot at a normal, decent, healthy adolescence.

I feel like I can’t do it now, because I’ve since cleaned up my life and simply don’t have the time. I’ve cut off my parents and moved to a different city. I now have a house, a decent job, a few good friends, a loving partner, a wonderful cat and plans to go to law school.

Despite all of that, thinking about my past is very painful and it’s hard to turn those thoughts off. I go to therapy, but I’ve never told my therapist about wanting to attempt suicide.

Trust me I have tried nearly everything.But sorry to all the people hating.Sorry that I exist and bother you so much by just existing.People dont want to have anything to do with me just because Im a ugly looser.Again I did not choose to be that way...this leads to me developing social anxiety on a high level and not believing in myself at all.I probably wasted the best time of my life playing video games...damn I really thought I could be a professional player but bad luck doesnt stop there either.Even tho gaming is my escape.and by now the only environment I feel really comfortable in because thats the only thing I have EVER been good in but of course not good enough to make something out of it.When Im playing no one insults me cause I look bad cuz thats not what counts.My entire life is a full on failure.Everyone hates me without even having talked to me once.Goddamn I have a crush on a girl for months and she doesnt even know my name.Of course she wouldnt be interested anyways,but it still hurts.Every day I think about suiciding,every single one.Maybe one day I would find a shit job cause Im useless anyways and then work until I fucking die alone in my room.  
Im not gonna let it get that far...I rather end my life then live completely lonely and full of pain.Like honestly why should I not just end my life now Instead of suffering?

I don’t really know what it is. It is a restless angst that I should be doing better, knowing more, can never be content with simple bliss/peace because it can be rationalized away AND, even if I pretend, it means there’s no inner conflict... which means stagnation. (And it’s more than this, this sounds like something close to teenagery nihilism, but it’s not that, I rationalize *everything,* even rationalization and so on and so forth.) 

I’ll give you an example, I can’t just hang out with my old friends anymore and be carefree the way I used to knowing what I know now (I can’t explain it, if you know you know, if you don’t you can only guess based on your limited experience and you won’t understand it.) they just talk about their boyfriends all day, so clueless. I can’t love my family without seeing the meaninglessness of it, and the meaninglessness of meaninglessness, and so on and so forth until the stars explode. My issues are not external but internal. I could have everything I’ve ever wanted and still be on the ledge over the lip of the abyss perpetually. 

Sorry for the #im14andthisisdeep post. But I’m really struggling over here to the point I’m using stupid vague writing and metaphors about abysses. It’s definitely an existential depression but I’m sure my external conditions aren’t helping. 

I don’t know, it would be so nice to talk to people, the reach for connection, especially anyone who’s been through the same.  People never really talked to me much, especially in this country, I was kinda a weirdo growing up. 

Um. Sorry I’m a shitty writer. (Do not say the contrary to be nice, anyways, shitty writing is mostly imprecise writing... too tired and drained for anything better...)

None of the mental health professionals understand what my problem is. “Maybe if you started a family...” no, that’s not it, it’s a constant restlessness and uneasiness with your being and existence and it’s largely not related to other people. Most of the philosophers I’ve read are pretty pessimistic, which logic seems to nearly always be, can’t live with their conclusions even if it’s “true” in a strictly logical sense. Once you start pulling on the red threads of emotions you thought were indisputably real the world is undone and gets very bleak very quickly...

,SuicideWatch,"I don't really know how to begin this wall of text, but let me preface this by saying that i am under 18 and a male, that's as much as i'm willing to say.
For a while my passions were able to fill the gaping hole in my soul, things like programming, writing, drawing, music. Until i just couldn't sustain it anymore. I suppose i have to dig down to the root of the problem.

**YOU'RE A PIECE OF SHIT, ME**

I get good grades. I have friends, both in real life and online. I have hobbies. Why the fuck can't i just be happy.

I really hate the image of myself that i give off to other people, when inside i feel completely different. I like to pretend that i don't care about most things, and most people seem to believe that i'm like that, even though i care more than i'd like to admit.

I've always been difficult for me to express myself, especially when i speak english better than my native language. I can't just talk about my feelings without cringing.

I used to dream of being a game developer, until i gave up on that dream. Most people still believe i want to do that, because i haven't told them about all the others things i like, and again, i cringe at the thought of doing so. It feels like my life is heading in a direction i don't want. I could be a writer, but i'd run out of ideas. I could be a musician, but i don't even know anymore.
When i feel depressed, everything seems impossible. All my dreams go down the drain. Life feels like an insurmountable challenge.

I seek to be known in the world. Not necessarily remembered, i just want my existance to be known while i am alive.

I don't speak to my friends about my problems because they'd probably tell me that i'm oversharing and i need to talk to my parents.
I don't talk to my parents about my problems because i feel too afraid of it.
I don't go to therapy because i need my parents to be able to do that, and if the therapist finds out that i am in immediate danger then they will have to inform my relatives.

I feel envious of other people when they have some positive personality trait or skill or material possesion or just anything that they have and i don't. This eventually just leads me to feeling unnecesarily angry at people who don't deserve it because i'm a greedy shitbag who wants everything in the world.
I hate most people just because of this. Sorry.

I am slowly losing interest in things that i used to enjoy. School or no school. Work or no work. It doesn't matter. This is getting boring. No matter how much time i have i will waste it laying in bed doing absolutely nothing. Not even looking at my phone or anything. Just nothing.

Life feels incredibly unfulfilling. I have no idea where i'm going with my life. The future is murky. And as i slowly lose interest in the things i do, i just want to shut my brain off and sleep forever.

I feel lonely even though i am surrounded by people that care for me. I push my family away. My friends don't care all that much, they just want to have fun, and i can't blame them honestly.

There is not a single day in my life where i am not worrying about something. Be it either what i said, what i did or how other people view me.

It all just feels so shitty. And i'm getting tired.

If i ever were to die, i want my death to be one final ""FUCK YOU"" to the entire world. Even though barely anybody would care. My relatives would probably be extremely sad. My friends would probably be a bit shaken. Other people would just be confused, probably. Other than that, the rest of the country or the world wouldn't care. But let's be honest, i don't have the means or the guts to do it.

So I've been through another heartbreak recently, and with lockdown and not the best family life I've kind of accepted that I will die soon? I've got full plan and all and I'm ready to go as well, just that I don't know when exactly within the next X days.

I hate to think about it this way, but my life for the last 6-7 years or so has been pretty botched in the sense of: Here's one amazing year for you, but suck it up cuz the next two are going to be downright horrible.

I've just kind of accepted really peacefully and with a lot of calm that y'know, maybe it's time to call it a day. Because I'm really really tired of this cycle constantly happening and I've just gotta cut my losses. They say life's a gamble, and sometimes you gotta walk away from the table because you're just getting bad hands.

I've spent the last few days connecting and calling some of my closest friends in the world, and I've just let them know about it plus telling them how much they all mean to me and how much I'll miss them. But yeah I more or less know what I have to do, just sharing my thoughts here.

I'm really not upset or sad about it, I feel like I've lived a really decent life as well. For all the pitfalls, I've managed to do things that most wouldn't haven't ever lived through for their entire lives, and for that, I'm grateful.

Y'know the one where every decision creates a different universe.

It was over &lt;a href=""/r/unsentletters""&gt;r/unsentletters&lt;/a&gt;. And three posts in. I fuckinf feel horrible, I fucking fell for his shit again. He knew I was looking at this Reddit, and posted things about missing me and being depressed and lonely and suicidal, on purpose. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I can’t even use my actual Reddit account because he’ll be able to look at it. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m so fuckinf stupid. He’s toxic, and not changed. I can’t take this. I just can’t take his hold on me being this strong I’m tired. I need to stop it.&lt;/p&gt;

,SuicideWatch,"I had been dating my ex for about 2 1/2 years. As my time through high-school progressed I started to become more and more depressed and anxious in general because of school, friend, and relationship related. When I would feel these ways, I would feel better when I talk to my ex and friends about my feelings. I talked to them too much and ended up deterring the friends I used to have away. Always still, I had my ex. We were toxic for each other and it hurts to admit it but I want to be the one she says she loves and to be the one she wants to hold in her arms. I don’t know if I couldn’t or didn’t fix the problems I had of jealousy, over sensitivity to anger, and controlling my emotions. I wanted to so badly. I don’t know why I never could. The same problems would repeat and repeat. All I had to do was to fix the problems. We got to the point where I said I wanted to break up on dec 31 2019 in the heat of the argument we were having. I instantly regretted it. That was it. We stopped talking for a few months but gradually started to talk more and more. We got closer again and slowly stopped having the same problems. Around this time it was harder. It was nearing the end of junior year with school stresses and one of my closest friends basically told me I made him feel suicidal and our whole friendship was fake and he never wanted it. He would also talk to me about his problems and I knew that he tended to be sensitive when in a mental state like that and I and our mutual friends knew he didn’t mean it. Nonetheless it really hurt and ended up dividing the 4 friends I had helping me through the breakup to go from talking to each other and planning hangout weekly to nothing anymore. 2 months after that, my ex and I continued to talk and had been acting like we were in a relationship but not entirely. We could tell each other “you’re so handsome!”,”you’re so pretty”,”I care about you so much to the moon and back”, and other like things like that. We would continue to see each other the few times we could and would hold hands, kiss, and cuddle. 4 days ago, she had told me that she was thinking of getting back together. I told her I understand and wanted to take things slowly because we still weren’t in the best mental states. I’d still be really depressed from losing a bunch of close friends and understanding our relationship wasn’t the same and she had been going through similarly with her friends. I was happy but was weary because I didn’t want to get back into it too quickly and wanted to take things slowly and carefully because I didn’t want to make the same mistakes again. We ended the night saying let’s just take things slowly and focus on each next obstacle of getting back together one by one. The next night we talked and she though about everything. How it would work out and when. How her parents would immediately be disappointed and how college would be and how it wouldn’t be secure. She admitted to me that she felt this way for a while but since it just felt good and she found my presence comforting(“you are so comforting”*said all sentimentally and shit) as I found her being in my life great.  She admitted and apologized for being selfish and not telling me about these feelings and that she doesn’t think getting back together is worth the view of her family on her. Her family is very critical of her and the time before we got back together, they openly expressed their disappointment with her, really hurting her mental health and self confidence. I said I forgave her and left and spent the entire night crying. The last few days I had been thinking about it day and night. How I could convince her that I was worth it. Yesterday, I said please, we can push through the barriers and get through this. She said no. I don’t know what to do now because aside from being my ex, she’s my closest friend. She’s my best friend. I still love her as I did in the relationship and as my best friend. I don’t want to lose another person that I love and care for so much as I have been for so long now but talking not as if we are anything but friends is hard for me. I have 4 friends I can talk to but I don’t ever feel relieved or good anymore if I vent or talk about my emotions to them. It feels like I will only feel okay if I have her again. I’ve been consistan suicidal for the last 2 years and have been trying so hard to get better since Jan 2020, but everything has only went downhill. I can’t have her anymore and don’t ever feel okay. I used to want happiness but I don’t anymore. I just don’t want to feel anymore. I want to die. I want to hurt myself. I can’t though and it feels suffocating. I can’t let out my emotions because there is no relief to it. I can’t kill myself because I’m too scared. I am so fucking lucky to be born in a loving and caring lower upper class family. We never have financial issues or have to worry about anything and i feel so useless because all I can do is lay in bed all day and cry. I want everything to end and to never feel again.

&lt;p&gt;Even if we were living in a utopia, if we ignore all the bumfuck corruption, greed, lying, bullshit going on in the world, say we live in a utopia. No more famine, no more pollution, everyone has  a roof over their head with all the utilities they need, that&amp;#39;s the goal right? What then? What&amp;#39;s the next step?

,SuicideWatch,"I posted on here before about my recent attempt and dealing with the shame and aftermath, and I’m ready to share with you guys my reasons because one of them is something I feel like isn’t talked about.



I have bipolar disorder and ADHD, and struggle with RSD (rejection sensitivity disorder) due to the ADHD. Over the years medication and therapy got me to a somewhat stable place but I think I mostly felt numb.



I was in a toxic relationship for 3 years with someone who abuses drugs. All kinds - coke, Xanax, heroin, literally anything and I love this man so much, but on drugs he’s a different person. The constant high and lows took a toll on me. I felt isolated and I couldn’t even bring him around my friends or family without worrying about him getting high and embarrassing me. He smoked meth in front of my younger sister so I eventually cracked. I broke up with him and told him I would be moving out. Later that night he attempted to overdose on Xanax and heroin and was sent to a psychiatric hospital and then to rehab, haven’t been able to talk to him.



I feel like the guilt was eating at me. He blamed me, his family blamed me, I felt like a terrible person. My best friend of 10 years who was my major support system dropped me a few days later because her boyfriend admitted an attraction to me and she resents me now. So she unfriended me and he blocked me. It was just so sudden and I was so confused why she would act this way. She knew I was going through a lot with my ex just attempting suicide, and thought this petty issue was worth dropping me for. It was just so insensitive.



I reached out to another friend who I admittedly have an attraction to but it was long distance and we couldn’t ever make it work. So we agreed on staying friends. He actually convinced me to break up with my boyfriend and leave my toxic relationship but now I don’t even know if it was for the right reasons or he just wanted something from me. Either way, he was super affectionate with me telling me I was beautiful and it wasn’t my fault and that he would come see me to keep me company. I was in a fragile state after losing the 2 closest people in my life. I reached out for help when I lost my best friend and he didn’t answer. I waited 2 days and then asked why he was leaving me on seen and then he told me he was just trying to live his life and blocked me on everything. So now another person had cut me off and made me feel like I was a huge annoying inconvenience. 


I felt like everyone hated me. I posted something on social media and people were coming at me and leaving me hate comments. I normally wouldn’t let something like this get to me but it came from the heart and I was feeling very sensitive and hate was the last thing I needed in that moment.


I tried to overdose. I posted on my social media it would be my last, and that it was always my intention to love these people and not hurt them but I felt like I was just tossed away like trash by the people I cared about the most. Someone left comments making fun of me for attention seeking or killing myself over a Facebook post. But someone called for me. Actually, multiple people did. I had over 200 messages from people concerned about me. When I saw this after my ER discharge I felt stupid that I let 3 people in my life get to me when there were so many people who cared.


Losing people you care about is hard, especially if they’re your closest support system. But the guilt of someone trying to kill themselves because of you, whether they succeed or not is overwhelming. I didn’t get the help I needed because I gave up after reaching out to 2 people. Please don’t give up. Someone will listen. I’ll listen. I can’t say it’s easy when a partner is this unstable and will threaten or actually commit suicide over you.

&lt;p&gt;I was in a toxic relationship for 3 years with someone who abuses drugs. All kinds - coke, Xanax, heroin, literally anything and I love this man so much, but on drugs he’s a different person. The constant high and lows took a toll on me. I felt isolated and I couldn’t even bring him around my friends or family without worrying about him getting high and embarrassing me. He smoked meth in front of my younger sister so I eventually cracked. I broke up with him and told him I would be moving out. Later that night he attempted to overdose on Xanax and heroin and was sent to a psychiatric hospital and then to rehab, haven’t been able to talk to him.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I feel like the guilt was eating at me. He blamed me, his family blamed me, I felt like a terrible person. My best friend of 10 years who was my major support system dropped me a few days later because her boyfriend admitted an attraction to me and she resents me now. So she unfriended me and he blocked me. It was just so sudden and I was so confused why she would act this way. She knew I was going through a lot with my ex just attempting suicide, and thought this petty issue was worth dropping me for. It was just so insensitive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I reached out to another friend who I admittedly have an attraction to but it was long distance and we couldn’t ever make it work. So we agreed on staying friends. He actually convinced me to break up with my boyfriend and leave my toxic relationship but now I don’t even know if it was for the right reasons or he just wanted something from me. Either way, he was super affectionate with me telling me I was beautiful and it wasn’t my fault and that he would come see me to keep me company. I was in a fragile state after losing the 2 closest people in my life. I reached out for help when I lost my best friend and he didn’t answer. I waited 2 days and then asked why he was leaving me on seen and then he told me he was just trying to live his life and blocked me on everything. So now another person had cut me off and made me feel like I was a huge annoying inconvenience. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I felt like everyone hated me. I posted something on social media and people were coming at me and leaving me hate comments. I normally wouldn’t let something like this get to me but it came from the heart and I was feeling very sensitive and hate was the last thing I needed in that moment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I tried to overdose. I posted on my social media it would be my last, and that it was always my intention to love these people and not hurt them but I felt like I was just tossed away like trash by the people I cared about the most. Someone left comments making fun of me for attention seeking or killing myself over a Facebook post. But someone called for me. Actually, multiple people did. I had over 200 messages from people concerned about me. When I saw this after my ER discharge I felt stupid that I let 3 people in my life get to me when there were so many people who cared.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Losing people you care about is hard, especially if they’re your closest support system. But the guilt of someone trying to kill themselves because of you, whether they succeed or not is overwhelming. I didn’t get the help I needed because I gave up after reaching out to 2 people. Please don’t give up. Someone will listen. I’ll listen. I can’t say it’s easy when a partner is this unstable and will threaten or actually commit suicide over you. I’m still learning how to cope with it.&lt;/p&gt;

But I realized I’d have to continue for another couple semesters in college so now I’ll be graduating at the 4.5 year mark instead of 4. I had moved out of a toxic environment with roomates into another bad situation, etc. My girlfriend (21F) is the most perfect person to me. She and I have always planned on marriage and children, and we believe eachother to be soulmates. I wanna make this clear: I don’t care about drugs, I really don’t. However, she has told me repeatedly she’s essentially addicted to weed and she doesn’t like herself on it. 6 months into our relationship, she was lying to me about smoking again, meeting up with ppl to smoke. After two more times, this winter she started it up again but this time she was getting it straight from the dealer and also getting into edibles, bragging to her coworker how turnt she got. 

It broke my heart because I’ve always told her that despite my being mad a lot and quick tempered, I just want the best for her and want her to feel safe to come to me. But she kept hiding it, and she’s hidden a lot from me in the past, even before I was so hard to talk to sometimes. It’s not the things she hides from me, but it’s about why she’s hidden it from me, like what’s going on? After the second time, i confronted my jealousy, rage fits, toxicity etc, and seemed to get better. But unfortunately I’d randomly criticize and be toxic still, so yeah we both haven’t been the best for eachother. Two wrongs don’t make a right though. Because this winter I started to drink a lot and tried to end my life.

One night after I saw some more texts of hers, I had a mental breakdown of sorts, and I ended up hooking up with another girl and cheated on my beloved. I hate myself for hurting my girlfriend so badly. I confessed to her a month later (April) because if we were gonna get married I didn’t want it to be on a lie. I moved out (I’m still paying my rent don’t worry), got into therapy, and I’m giving her her requested space and time. She said she still loves me but doesn’t know what she wants yet.
I was supposed to protect her and all I did was let my immaturity and insecurity run rampant, concealing the truth about my nature so that I wouldn’t seek help sooner. She doesn’t have anyone to talk to really besides ppl she isn’t close with, so she’s been alone all these past three months wondering why someone who claims love for her would stab her in the heart like this. My heart aches for her pain.

,SuicideWatch,"I'm 23 and I have been depressed since I was 13, been through hell with social services etc and school, I had an under 10 percent attendance the whole of high school, have 0 grades and was nearly put in a home.

I just didnt care what happened to me, i didn't care about anything. I was being bullied quite badly(physically)

I had hardly left my room in many many years and I have to admit, I kind of absolutely hate other people. And I'm sure they hate me.

Anyway now I'm on my own, got kicked out for addiction problems and stuff and been through homeless service. The sad thing is, I remember thinking to myself alot,  being excited that I might actually hit rock bottom so hard, that it might push me to go through with killing myself this time.

I just exist. I have no goals. Or aspirations. I care for naught. I've sabotaged relationships, all sorts because.... Well I don't know...... I'm a piece of shit cunt.

I get up, play ps4 and sleep, I never eat or go out due to panic disorder etc. I collect my shitty benefit and get scolded all the time and looked at like scum because I still wear clothes that I was wearing when i was 14.. I don't think I've ever been impolite in public to anyone, in fact I try way too fucking hard to be nice. I think. I don't fucking know. 

My life is fucking meaningless and I hate that people think if I was to stop the pain, that it would be selfish.

The only thing that ever stopped me was fear. I'm just so scared of dying slowly and painfully whilst being conscious, it horrifies me.

If there was a button to instantly do it, I'd have pressed it many years ago.

All this rage and anger I have about the past just doesn't go away, no matter how much I talk to therapists or go out to clubs and take pills. I'm so fucked and the doctor just legally isn't allowed to tell me that, but I know she would if she could.

Bullies dictated my life. And they're doing fucking fantastic. What happened to all the people saying karma exists because it fucking doesn't.

The only thing that would make my life better and make me happy is knowing that the man that molested the love of my life for 5 years whilst I was dating her when I was 13 to 18 years old, got fucking killed. That's it, any other way I'm not satisfied. I don't give a shit. The horrible horrible unspeakable things he did right under my nose are unforgivable. I hope one day I can go to jail for that cunt to be very honest, at least my life will have amounted to Something. I'll atleast have saved a future victim from him.

Oh don't even get me started on the bullies that pissed on me repeatedly and would threaten me with knives etc

I was such a soft kid who didn't even know what his dick was for at the age of 12. I never hurt anyone, but everyone hurt me.

Fuck the world, private pyle had it right and shot that fucker in the face before taking himself out of this shit hole.

,SuicideWatch,"im a 17 year old queer autistic kid whos deluded himself into thinking hes a man. im receiving support through the NDIS to help me with school and basic tasks i cant do properly because im autistic. i hate getting help. i hate NEEDING help. i feel infantalised and emasculated by the way teachers and mentor figures have to treat me so i dont fucking cry and have a breakdown because i dont wanna do my homework. or my schoolwork. or work in general. or improve myself in any fucking way shape or form.

im a creative person. i like to write and draw. im a good singer. i had a main role in last year’s school production. but im burned out. i only ever wrote shitty explicit fanfic, i cant be bothered drawing unless im tracing something in ms paint, i cant write song lyrics, and this years production has been cancelled for obvious reasons.

ive been struggling with school for years. i was in year 11 VCE last year, but i didnt get enough assessments finished for a passing grade. ive been moved into year 11 VCAL. to non-australian people, this means that not only have i been held back a grade, but i’ve been moved into a program designed for people who want to join the workforce as soon as possible. carpenters, mechanics, you get the idea.

everyone in VCAL acts like a fucking crackhead all the time. my school is already full of bogans but jesus fucking christ it’s a warzone in there. no one ever shuts up, they all just run around the room and talk to their friends, ignoring the designated seating arrangements (even before social distancing was a factor. yes, VCAL locks us into assigned seating in high school. again, i feel fucking infantalised.)

i hate VCAL. i hate being associated with these people. i hate that anyone i couldve called a friend last year has moved on to year 12 VCE like normal, competent people who i can never talk to again. i hate that i cant talk to people at school because i have been bullied for as long as ive been in the education system and now i always feel like i’m imposing myself on people if i so much as look at them.

i hate that i’m no better than anyone else in VCAL because i dont do the work either. at least everyone else can fuck around with their friends all day. i’m just the fat douchebag tranny who frequently bursts into tears and never even takes my books out of my bag. i think most of the teachers have given up on making me engage in classes. at this point they’re just keeping up appearances when they acknowledge my presence.

im only in VCAL because the school counsellors all told me i should and i never say no to their ideas because theres no fucking point. im only in VCAL because the workload is meant to be lighter and more bearable and i can tie my projects into my special interests. if only i could talk about my interests without fucking cringing until i implode because what self respecting teenager fucking hyperfocuses on splatoon? who fucking cares?

im probably only trans because my dad died when i was 5 and now i have daddy issues. my two older sisters are both living shitty lives. my eldest sister is 22 and still lives at home playing video games in her room all day. she has no friends. the second oldest is 19 and lives with her boyfriend in a shitty relationship shes not happy with, but they both smoke pot and vape and whatever so they dont have to care. i hate knowing we’ve changed so much. we’re not kids anymore and i wish we were just so i didnt have to worry about getting spat out of mandatory education as a directionless burnout who would rather die than disappoint or inconvenience anyone ever again. i dont want to end up like either of my older sisters

but i have a little sister as well. shes 11 years younger than me. i was almost just like her when i was her age. an annoying tech-obsessed brat with violent outbursts. i cant stand being around her. no one in the house knows how to deal with her and i know from experience its going to fuck her up forever. the thought of ruining her life fucking hurts more than anything. but just like everything else, i dont know how to stop it and i cant be bothered to change that.

tl;dr at school, im an inconsolable douchebag who assumes the worst in everyone and makes a point to never engage in school even though i constantly get help for that. at home i’m a lazy asshole who distracts myself with video games, discord and youtube all day and rages at my little sister for being just like me as a kid. im all too aware how shitty my habits are, but i’m too lazy to improve, too lazy to learn, too lazy to live.

the only upside is that im too lazy to kill myself for now. i cant be bothered buying anything to mix with the eucalyptus oil so i dont puke it right away, and im pretty sure i would just fail and make everyone miserable and waste space in a hospital. but im going to kill myself at some point. every day that i dont is just delaying the inevitable.",t2_3h6xlr9l,False,,0,False,i have a potentially lethal case of “can’t be assed”,[],r/SuicideWatch,False,,,0,,False,t3_h09qod,False,dark,0.8,,public,6,0,{},,False,[],,False,False,,{},,False,6,,False,,False,,[],{},,True,,1591820301.0,text,,,,text,self.SuicideWatch,False,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;im a 17 year old queer autistic kid whos deluded himself into thinking hes a man. im receiving support through the NDIS to help me with school and basic tasks i cant do properly because im autistic. i hate getting help. i hate NEEDING help. i feel infantalised and emasculated by the way teachers and mentor figures have to treat me so i dont fucking cry and have a breakdown because i dont wanna do my homework. or my schoolwork. or work in general. or improve myself in any fucking way shape or form.&lt;/p&gt;

If I can’t find heroin, I’m going to use a noose and do it in the woods. If that won’t work I’ll starve and dehydrate myself to death. If that won’t work I’ll jump off a building, drown myself, or jump in front of a train. I’m pretty determined. But I also aim for perfection. 

So I’ve realized that my life is pretty much over. It’s been over since I was born. Born into a shitty family, born as a birth defect (I’m trans mtf), and I was bullied relentlessly in school. 

I was around 8-10 since I became really depressed and suicidal. Parents kept fighting. My bro and I never got along. I hated myself because I knew I was in the wrong body and the never ending 24/7 dysphoria. Kids at school bullied me to no end. Every fucking day. I dreaded going to school. I dreaded coming home to hear and see a dysfunctional family. 

I have no family. My mother is stupid. She believes in God and in the Quran. Apparently I’m a sinner and a man to her. She’s very manipulative and she helped sabotage my first relationship. I live with her rn because I’m trying to find my own place before I move out instead of being homeless for another year. 

Anyway, she’s a cunt. My brother is an asshole and has his own issues. He hates me. 

I dropped out of university when I was 19, so I can kms. But I found out about hormones so I went to grab them via informed consent.

Imagine waking up from a coma and you missed out 33 years of your life. That’s basically where I’d be. I already missed 23 years of my shitty life. I’m not even alive yet.

I have a extreme situation that can't be recovered from; needless to say I will never be able to describe it fully enough for many to understand. In fact; the less details I provide many may think I'm guilty of the crime. Alas; my grief is because I am not guilty, and I alone will be the one to know that.

My wife has decided to protect her kids. I respect that. An incident of over friendliness has made our youngest think I'm a creep; I am too naive to be a creep. I'm a sysadmin, and I deal with reports and data... but I'm out of my league here.

At lunch (four days ago) I kissed my wife before I left, and asked if we might sit down later and find a good movie. She's been at work a lot at night lately, so I had some weird internal feeling of missing her more than usual. I left for work and all was fine.

I became homeless in an instant. I was at work and told of a calamity of deceiving appearances. I am labeled a creep; and my wife says she believes me, but has to take care of the kids. She is going to be homeless too, and tells me I shouldn't worry about them anymore. I feel obligated because these were my kids for 2 and a half years. She still tells me she loves me... I brought her from bad to worse and now their option is to move in with a formerly abusive ex (as roommates splitting bills I'm told). I love them all; and I was innocent. I might be guilty of negligence, but I was am too gregarious and didn't put up firm boundaries as an adult. Something as simple as scratching a back of a relative could be perceived in a variety of ways; even if it's customarily normal for months, one day it could be seen as something else.

alas; I'll forever be the only one who can believe me. I can't question my 10 year old daughter on a stand. I respect that I lost this fight... with no chance for a defense to take place. I've been assaulted and I never want my kids to fear that from me. That's nowhere near close to what actually took place, but it gives you the context to understand the severity. It's just so wrong; because I wasn't guilty... but I'll die a marked and guilty man.

I can't live like this. This isn't my first suicidal thought. I just can't keep doing this.  I can't live a life with my wife telling me she loves me; but never seeing it through, or believing I would give anything for them and never bring them harm.

I'm infuriated that there is no such thing as TRUE EXTERNAL TESTIMONY. I loathe this world for making it a he said - she said elaboration frenzy instead of being able to come together and see the truth.

Does therapy help? because I'm paid in a few days and currently on the streets in the company van. my employer doesn't know I'm sleeping in it.

,SuicideWatch,"hi everybody
i never opened up to anybody before but today is a day that i hope never happened.

i am terrified, i can't think straight and english is not my first language so sorry if all this doesn't seem to make sense.

so, i am a teenager who has spent all her life being the strong one. I'm the smallest(?) child of three and even if we always were good with each other there's a lot of issues and we all struggle with expressing emotions like sadness and anger because my mother who raised us alone was raised in a hostile climate and never taught us how to deal with those feelings.

my father was abusive and violent but thankfully he never did anything to me. my brother was his favorite so he didn't get hurt either but I grew up seeing my sister being punished and hit violently regularly. tbh all my memories are blurry but one time he whipped her so hard she bleed and this image has stuck with me since.

thankfully my mother managed to make him leave home but to this day he still has a grip on us and is in our life because of many divorce issues and other bs. this asshole stole a bunch of our money and my sick mother can't do any more than she does.

anyways, after he left (i was between 8 and 11 old at the time, my brain won't let me remember exactly) i went to a psy but idk if i rigged the exams or if it was just hidden but they couldn't find anything wrong w me. my sister had severe depression and i think she tried to commit suicide i have no clue. my brother is a special case, he has always been weird and I've never seen him cry and he's kinda toxic each time i express sadness so i prefer not to talk abou

just got in an argument w him and my mother I am tired of not being able of understanding what's wrong, i don't want to kill myself and i won't do it but I'm so scared, today i started to hit myself and i don't want to see a doctor

,SuicideWatch,"I’ve been depressed since I was 11, diagnosed at 12 (I’m 16 now). Don’t get me wrong therapy and medication has helped significantly, but I’m still quite suicidal. I don’t see a future for myself, I don’t see me alive in 5-10 years. I’ve missed tons of school, from dropping out in the past to sob in bed.. and it seems impossible to catch up.. I’m still doing 9th grade work. I have no friends I lost all of them also when I dropped out, and I have severe social anxiety about making friends. I’m almost 17, and haven’t gotten a job or my drivers license, hell I don’t even know how to order my own meal. I feel so dependent on my parents, and I blame them in a way for babying me so much then blaming me for everything. Every time I think of killing myself, I think of my sister.. who’s the only one who’s there for me, but even she has her own life to live. I feel like I’ve taken advantage of having therapy for so many years and still not able to cope without it, when my therapist suggest its time to discharge. I don’t want to grow up, I can’t..

I was trying to talk about my feelings. I just want to talk to someone about hopeless I feel. I'm so worse off than I did years ago. I didn't think I'd live this long, I tried to kill myself two times.

Honestly fuck them, they never care. No one will care when I die.
It might be a surprise to some people in real life but I know none of them care.

I'm still in planning stage of it, I'm not sure if I'll pussy out or not. I have a day for it. I don't care if I fail, if I fail badly then people will know that I'm serious and need help. I want to die but at the same time I want someone to take me seriously. Its so painful mentally living.

,SuicideWatch,"I'm in one of those really good high schools where not having great grades is considered a sin. If it were up to me, I would go to some normal boring school where I can actually have some good grades without stressing my brains out every day, maybe even meet some people who I'm not terrified to talk to (talking to people who know exactly what they want to do in life and have straight As is pretty hard when you barely pass most of the classes), but there was no way my mom would let that happen and now that I do have a chance to change schools after the first year... I can't really make myself do it. Yeah, I miss going to a normal school, but I live in Poland, English is about the only thing I'm good at and there's no way I'm trading my school's level of English for a class of morons who after learning for 9 years still can't remember what Present Simple is for.

Speaking of my mom, she's an abusive narcissistic... deeply flawed human being. I never thought I could hate anyone so much. And then there's my dad who thinks he's the best father in the world and doesn't understand why I want to hit him in the face with my math textbook (over 400 pages) most of the time. The answer is: he does nothing but argue with her and let her pretend everything's fine afterwards - and thinks he's doing everything he can. The situation is more difficult with him, because I still love the idea of him. I think. I can't make myself hate him like I do my mother and it's awful, because once the anger fades a little I feel so guilty for ever thinking anything bad about him.

I have two friends. Or maybe one and a half. Pat, one whole friend, is about the best human being alive, but has a... sh\*t ton of friends. She's friends with literally everyone. SO I'm no one special to her, really. And she's there for me when it gets really bad with my mom, but I know she's just done with listening to me whine about everything all the time.

The worst of all, though, is my brain. It's pretty useless, really. And losing fights with your own brain every day sucks. I have literally no social skills - which makes working in groups a nightmare, as well as having a decent conversation with anyone besides my two friends. No one ever likes me and I can see exactly why. And I always tell myself: new year/school, new start. I'm going to change. And I never do. I'm terrified of people, I had a literal panic attack on the bus on my way to school once, but only once, so I can't really make too much of a big deal out of it - but I think it gives you an idea of it. And comunicating with them... it's like trying to hold a conversation with someone from across the street. You can see each other alright, but the fun begins when you start trying to talk. Just not possible. I ended up with my wHoLe class hating me after... maybe 2 months. Ridiculous.

And, as I mentioned earlier, I'm failing most of my classes. My parents are pissed (I don't care about mom, but it sucks that my dad can't see that supporting me might just be better than yelling at me). Everyone in class hates me. I have no emotional support, not from Pat (I eventually stopped texting her when things got bad - so like every 10 minutes - because even with my 0 social skills I can see how much of a burden I'm being), definitely not from my parents. I'm stressed about literally everything to a ridiculous extent - I'm failing group project after group project because I can't make myself even respond to my classmates' texts without panicking. My favourite teacher whom I adore just wrote me an email and I'm not even going to read it in the next few hours but I can tell she's pissed at me. I spend most of my days stressing my brains out in the darkest pit of self loathing, depression TM and so on.

And I can't see any hope for myself. I'm completely useless. I have no one who really loves me. I'm too ashamed of myself to go with my dad to see my family tomorrow (I've seen them 2 times in my life and they're really good people but COME ON, I'm not making another group of decent human being hate me). I've been thinking about just killing myself for a... long time, but it was always just a thought. I knew I didn't want to die, I just wanted to stop hurting. I wanted to spend some more time with Pat, finish watching Daredevil, become a writer, maybe. But today was... bad. And for the first time I realized it's not going to get better. I'm not going to change, people will always hate me, I'm going to be alone and completely friendless and every fantasy I've ever had, about life getting better, it's just not going to happen.

,SuicideWatch,"I can’t. I’m too scared. If I wasn’t scared, I would’ve ended it all years ago.

My mom and my boyfriend are the only reasons I’m alive. They’ve done nothing but love me, support me, make me feel like I have worth, and they haven’t let me down once. I really want to end it all because I’m just so exhausted, but I don’t want to know what’s going to happen to them when I’m gone.

My mom is struggling and she’s extremely stressed. Not just because of work, but because of my family. She’s told me things like “I give up”, “I surrender”, “God please take me now” and other things that make it sound like she’s suicidal. I’ve told her many times to take therapy, but she won’t do it. I’m worried about her and I don’t want to imagine how she’ll feel if I’m gone. She told me I’m the only reason why I’m alive.

The same goes to my boyfriend. He told me multiple times that he’s thought of suicide many times, but he never attempted to do it because of me and his family. 

I’ve had enough of life. 

Growing up, I was the child no one would really pay attention to, while my sister had all the love. She would get all this support in everything, she would get gifts for no reason, but me? Oh no. I get nothing. It was no one except my parents (mostly my mom) that really gave a shit about me. Every time I had an issue, I was always told “ignore it”, “it’ll get better”, “other people have it worse”, “quit overreacting”, or anything of that sort. No one but my mom listened to me. It made me feel as if my feelings weren’t valid and to this day, made me fear opening up to anyone. I would also be the one to blame for something I never did. I was ALWAYS the bad guy in every argument.

I’ve talked to suicide hotlines many times and I just got hung up on or got a worker that sounded like they didn’t care about me. 

No, I can’t get a therapist because my parents won’t let me and because therapy’s pricy.

I’ve tried to end it so many times, but nothing’s happened, which I am a bit happy about, but not at the same time. I’m extremely scared of dying, but at the same time, I can’t stand living another day.

&lt;p&gt;My mom and my boyfriend are the only reasons I’m alive. They’ve done nothing but love me, support me, make me feel like I have worth, and they haven’t let me down once.

,SuicideWatch,"I made this account to post on another sub about how to cope with the struggles in my marriage.

&amp;#x200B;

I don't have the energy to write out everything. I'm tired of it. Here's the TL;DR: I destroyed my first marriage by lying about my ability to fix my problems with my sexuality (trouble being aroused due to early anchoring of abnormal things and exacerbated through years of self-destructive behavior like porn addiction). Now I'm afraid I've destroyed my second one; now, however, I have two young children to think about.

&amp;#x200B;

But thinking about them....I'm not sure I want them to know me. If I died today, they are young enough that they probably wouldn't remember much about me. And I know my wife's parents would help, and she would certainly find someone that would be a great parent to the girls.

&amp;#x200B;

I know by killing myself I would be causing pain to them, but the evidence of my life shows that I only cause pain and suffering everywhere I go. Maybe it's just about choosing the lesser of two evils. What's worse: losing your parent as a toddler, or going through a divorce and custody and every other thing that would happen for years, and, on top of that, having a terrible person for a father, who loses his temper, swears in front of them, makes them afraid of him. Who is too lazy to play with them for more than 10 minutes. Who is mediocre at everything.

&amp;#x200B;

Really my whole life is an exercise in mediocrity pretending to be something more. I have never accomplished anything worth anything.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm rambling, but now I'd like to make a pro/con list of my suicide:

Pros:

• My wife can be free and happy

• My children can grow up with a better parent

• I don't have to try anymore.

Cons

• It will hurt my children, both long- and short-term.

• My wife will feel responsible and may have difficulty coping.

• The truth about why our marriage fell apart will likely come out, and will reveal some secrets that will further destroy her life.

&amp;#x200B;

So I obviously, the cons are pretty strong there. But, if I were dead, I wouldn't know about any of that. I'd either be nowhere, lost to eternity, or in hell, where I belong. I'm a selfish, angry asshole after all. Even thinking about suicide is selfish. For once I want to do something that isn't selfish.

&amp;#x200B;

Basically, what it comes down to is I don't think I can do what it takes to get through what is happening right now. Before it's all over, I'm just going to end up hurting everyone even more, and I already can't bear the pain and guilt and fear.

&amp;#x200B;

My wife and I could spend some time apart, while I try to work on my issues. It will probably take years, and even then, my wife will never trust me again. So why go through it? If I don't go through it, I'll have to exit their lives anyway. And if I'm not in their lives anyway, why should I have to keep living and feeling the pain?

&amp;#x200B;

i don’t even know what to say or where to start, but now a days i’m feeling so hopeless and i keep having suicidal thoughts and i’ve started to self harm again. It’s because of a lot of things but mostly because of my awful grades and i have no motivation to do anything, i don’t even have motivation to live let alone sit here and do work that’s been piling up since april. 

And now that school is about to end and my final grades are gonna be posted i can’t help but have multiple mental breakdowns because i know i’ll fail and i don’t want to. I want to tell my mom i’m struggling so much mentally before she sees my grades because i know she’ll be disappointed and i feel like i disappointed her enough. 

The only problem is i know she’ll freak out, a year ago she found my suicide letter on my phone and before she could look at it she started accusing me of awful things like doing drugs or talking to guys (i was 13 at the time) i know she was just worried on why i hiding it but it hurt so bad because it was suicide letter, of something i couldn’t control. when i gave in and she read it she completely freaked out and said that i was weak and how could i betray her after everything she did for me? and i was genuinely expecting her to console me so it hurt even more and i started crying really bad. it still hurts and i’m scared to tell her, but if i don’t she’ll see my grades and just think i’m being lazy when i can’t study even if i want. 

I don’t know what to do, my mind is such a mess right now and i’m constantly having negative thoughts and i don’t know how long i’ll hang on, i’m doing my best, and have been for a year but i think i might lose it soon, but i don’t want to, the thing is i want to live but i have nothing to live for and right now i’m such a mess.

,SuicideWatch,"I’m 31. I’m a gay man who was born in a broken family. My father put his last name on me and left us after a week. 
At 3 years old I had an accident trying to climb on the kitchen and busted my head causing me a mild brain injury that would be the root of my undiagnosed ADHD and severe anxiety issues. 
I was raised in a very hostile environment where my mom retaliated all her anger and frustrations beating the crap out of me all the time. My grandma who was the light of my childhood had a seizure when I was 8 years old and ended up crippled in a wheelchair until she died 11 years later. She turned into the biggest and most annoying burden a small family can endure. 
My mom was obsessed with the idea that no matter the cost I had to be in a privileged private school even when I was bullied for being different in so many ways. I was made fun of out of everything. My height (I’m also 5,6), my sudden queer manners, my clumsiness...etc...I even developed severe dermatillomania in my hands due to severe anxiety. it was hell, I had 2 attempts for suicide that were totally ignored by everyone like it didn’t really matter. The only friend close friend that I had only lasted a year and half after his mom passed away in the middle of his first year in the school... 
I was the poorest of my classroom, I had the worst house, my mom drove the cheapest car and even my dogs were ugly as fuck. Neighbors would always made fun of my pets. 
My house, disgusting, always dirty...my mom was a semi hoarder and would always accumulate clothes and books. 
I would never invite anybody out of deep shame. 
My grades in school were ok. 
I was very good in some and horrible in the others. I had to spend extra hours memorizing stuff because I would not understand simple shit sometimes. Every time I had to speak in public I would panic and stutter and people would laugh. 
My scape was video games, I would play so much that because of it, it started affecting my visual impairment and started developing strabismus at 15 years old....
After I graduated, i got out of my hometown and got to a private university paid by my mom. 
I struggled a lot in college. 
I felt stupid and out of place. I was always awkward and lacked social skills. 
I would annoy the fuck out of people and they would ignore me. 
In my time off I focused myself to try hard and be more physically attractive so I would go to the gym and have tons of protein supplements. 
I would also go to play Magic theGathering whenever I could and eventually got good at it but due to my undiagnosed ADHD I would mess up all the time. I would get so angry at losing. 
At 21 I lost my hair. I was balding bad since 18. 
I hated my look. I was always angry because I had to wear a hat to look like my age. I would look almost 10 years older. 
While in college, I started forcing myself in doing internships but I would be so difficult to work with due to my behavior and forgetfulness. 
On my last semesters I would try to work on the side but got fired twice. 
I gave up on my 8th semester and quit college for a year out of deep shame for myself. I felt humiliated constantly. 
To fix my visual impairment I managed to get a surgery in a public hospital after a 3 months wait. 
I “fixed it”...when back to college. Same struggles on other areas. Didn’t give up this time, suffered a lot to get that thesis done. My thesis barely passed...it was basic and shitty. 
I didn’t make any friends and even when i was invited by default to the college graduation party I barely knew anybody and it was awkward as fuck. 
After college. I started internships again (neither of the didn’t last long tbh). I would sugarcoat my resume to death to appeal to employers, I ended up being hired in a couple places but surprise, got fired in the first and the second was horrible an abusive position that nobody else would take and therefore ended up there for a year. I got so depressed I ended taking medication for depression and quit that job. I got hired in an ad agency which fired me after a month. 
I gave up on everything and  sold my MTG cards to buy my ticket to the US...
I tattooed my head in a micropigmentation style so it gave me a younger appearance and it somehow made me feel less shitty about my genetic makeup. 
I ended up as a server in multiple places. I worked as busser, server and even did cleaning labors. 

I would throw up in bathrooms out of panic, anger and shame. I got hospitalized in 2016 for severe depression...
I ended up working in a total of 15 places. In which I got fired in 9 of them. 
I got diagnosed of ADHD at 29. After being fired for like the 12th time for being messy, scattered minded and forgetful. After meds I saw the light. I started getting creative. It was like a miracle. 

Too bad I lost my 20’s and teens in a very miserable way. 

Even when in these 2 years of new life I’ve improved a lot, I still can’t get a job out of my lack of experience and creating a business takes a lot of investment that I haven’t been able to acquire. 
Social media makes me sick and gives me PTSD  every time I get to see the accomplishments of those people that I studied with and all their successful relationships. The amount of mental disorders I’ve gathered through so much abuse are way too much to handle and paying for a friend (therapy) hasn’t solved the issue. 
I now have CPTSD, Rejection sensitivity dysphoria and probably some mild form of autism. 

What is the point of all this suffering? 

I’ve gone against all odds...fought many battles. But in the end...it doesn’t even matter. 

Why do people like me exist? Is not like someone is going to give me a life medal for overcoming the gigantic struggles of my life. 

Nobody wants to date me because I’m so emotionally damaged. I’m in total fear of meeting new people and isolation made everything worse. I’m a couple months away of being possibly homeless and if I get to that  point it’s definitely over. 

Is life even worth all this shit?

,SuicideWatch,I am 17 years old. I know a lot of this sub is for people right on the verge of doing something unthinkable sobi will not insult them by making this post too long. Ever since I was a kid I had certain ideals and goals. These goals meant so much to me that when I was 16 I had decided that if these goals weren't fulfilled till xx years of my life I would end it. I know it's a waste. I myself try to dissuade people from taking the extreme step. But I know that if I don't do what I want to do then existence will become more if a hell for me. These 15 years(I hardly remember the first 2)have been extremely hard and I am at peace with my decision.

I'm not going to put too many specific details just in case any of my family is also here.

They don't realise how much we love them and that we absolutely would be so much worse off without them in our lives.

But what I'm really struggling with is that it was timed for absolute maximum drama. I want your help understanding that so I can support them and the rest of my family to the best of my ability.

If I am brutally honest I am kind of angry about the drama part. If they didn't really want to die and this was a cry for help, they would have got the same help whoever found them if you see what I mean?

Not overwhelmed over a test, or overwhelmed by people who care. But overwhelmed, stuck in your head, where you literally can't breathe. It's been about a week since I last complied my thoughts and thought out erasing myself from existence. I understand it's a very dramatic way of phrasing it but it's just how my mind works I guess. My mind always puts easy things into a blender. Anyway, it probably doesn't sound like I'm serious or anything. It's a lot. The racing thoughts, second guessing myself, ignorant gut feelings, they don't stop. I don't feel much of anything anymore. I only feel what someone would describe as butterflies, but they're infectious moths instead. I keep running my entire last few years in my head seeing what I've done right and what I've done wrong. And to say the least I keep punishing myself for the bad, and not giving myself any credit for the good. I feel like all the good is just substantial. I'm expected to be good and I want to be good so I try my best.  But that's the thing. Sometimes it's not enough. Sometimes nothing is ever good enough.  


I've spent the entirety of my 20's lying to myself. I went to college for nearly 5 years. I fucked that up, and because I couldn't travel I couldn't get my degree and graduate. I tried tirelessly going from job to job to find SOMETHING somewhat stable, to no avail. And with relationships, I don't even want to get started. I had put my whole fucking heart out on display for someone 2-3 years ago. Just for her to move in with me, sleep with someone else, have him move in and kick me out on the same day. Maybe it was then I knew I wasn't worth anything to anymore. Yeah, maybe it sounds silly. She was one person, but maybe she was right. I'm an introvert destined to be alone. Later on though I did find an amazing friend group who I cherish very much. But Lapis, why then are you thinking about killing yourself? The answer isn't simple. I realized last year that nobody can save me and I have to save myself. I've been trying so fucking hard to do that. I started 2020 with my head up high. One thing after another tried to pull me down, but not without me trying so hard to push through.   


In January, I had four kidney stones at once along with a respiratory infection. Maybe that's nothing for some people but I wanted to die. I was stone cold the rest of the day. All the laughs I shared, all the smiles I gave, they were all lies. February comes, I decided I wanted to bury this shallow feeling and help others. I take my journey to an app called TalkLife and meet someone special. They will go nameless as I don't want their name dragged in the dirt if I decide it's time to go. I don't know why it would considering one thing: they've been the only person keeping me going. I won't say anything toxic like I've dedicated my entire life to them, but they have absolutely been the limelight at the end of the tunnel. I've felt so calm and level headed when I've talked to them. I love and cherish them a whole lot. But even still, I don't want to breathe anymore. I have what I can only describe as a hold through my chest and stomach. I can't feel. I'm numb. I'm not okay. This person loves and appreciates me a whole lot. But I even screwed up with them. My emotions are so fucked up that I almost pushed away the one person who it truly feels doesn't judge me for a thing, doesn't care that I'm Non-Binary, doesn't care that I'm this unbalanced. Someone who finally treats me how I've always wanted to be. Someone who makes me feel wanted. So given all that... why do I still want to die?  


This is the end of my story. I've had virtually no physical touch from another person in what feels like years. It's only been four months in reality, but in my reality it feels like years. I didn't go in my room tonight expecting to feel like this. I don't want to think like this anymore. But I'm at the end of my rope. I'm hurting. I don't want to hurt anymore. And please... don't give me that it passes the pain to someone else. I feel bad enough. I never wanted to let my two roommates down. I never wanted to let my best friend down; my Animal Crossing partner, my Toontown buddy, my matcha loving bean, I'm so sorry. You were always so kind to me. I'll never forget that. I doubt they'll ever read this but please don't be hurt. I can't handle it anymore. You've heard my struggles. I can't drag you down with me. I outright refuse. I can't go on like this anymore. I don't know when or if I'm going to do it. It could be tonight, it could be never. Either way, I'm sorry.

I guess that won&amp;#39;t matter anymore come time, nothing pertaining to me will. Have you ever felt overwhelmed? Not overwhelmed over a test, or overwhelmed by people who care. But overwhelmed, stuck in your head, where you literally can&amp;#39;t breathe. It&amp;#39;s been about a week since I last complied my thoughts and thought out erasing myself from existence. I understand it&amp;#39;s a very dramatic way of phrasing it but it&amp;#39;s just how my mind works I guess. My mind always puts easy things into a blender. Anyway, it probably doesn&amp;#39;t sound like I&amp;#39;m serious or anything. It&amp;#39;s a lot. The racing thoughts, second guessing myself, ignorant gut feelings, they don&amp;#39;t stop. I don&amp;#39;t feel much of anything anymore. I only feel what someone would describe as butterflies, but they&amp;#39;re infectious moths instead. I keep running my entire last few years in my head seeing what I&amp;#39;ve done right and what I&amp;#39;ve done wrong.

I hate myself, too. It's such a deep loathing that I can barely look into the mirror without ruining my day. I'm a hideous creature. One that doesn't belong in this world. I know full well I will never be able to have any sort of love life, and I most definitely will die alone. A girl would never want something like me. She wants a man, one that can help her and her, him. She doesn't want to have to babysit a thing like me, make sure that it gets it's undeserved pity from her.

So now what? What's the point? I'm not even smart. I can't get into a high paying job so I can at least travel. Even if I did, I'm so lazy that I would call out once every week and get fired, anyways. I don't even want to think about doing a trade job. I would be dead before the week ended.

fast forward to 4 months ago and she up and left with both our kids. When she left she assured me she would let me see the kids and she wouldn't bother me cause she could see how fucked up I was by it.

fast forward to no and I've seen my kids 2 or 3 times since she left, all because everytime I've asked to see them she's had an excuse such as ""it's a waste of petrol"" or ""the kids both have coughs"", both these lies have been proven to be just that as I've then been shown they're out and about elsewhere.

She had my phone contract cancelled 3 weeks ago, and I was left with no contact with anyone at all, I had no means of getting in touch with my kids or my family or friends, and I ended up hitting rock bottom.

,SuicideWatch,"I know people are probably not going to care to read all of this but I need to get it off my chest.  


I've never really experienced love in my life. I don't just mean romantic love but also family an friend. I've had glimpses of it but it always ended up with rejection, emotional neglect, or abuse etc. I know some of it is my fault in the last several years because I lost hope in love actually existing for someone like me and therefor I either stop trying or run away but the last couple of times I really tried my hardest to be open I just get rejected/abandoned or emotionally neglected. I can't even describe how deep the hurt is at this point but it's unbearable.   


My parents were very distant, they'd physically care for me but emotionally they were never there. The rare time they did speak to me was to say how disappointed they were, how they liked my sibling better, how I was a bad child even though I wasn't. I vividly remember cracking in the middle of the night because of bullying in school and going to my mom crying and she didn't care at all. My father has hit me, yelled in my face and just generally didn't like me because I was struggling and I'm not what they wanted. Eventually I got kicked out over nothing when I was 18. I've been estranged from my family for over a decade now, the few times I tried they took no responsibility for their actions and always blamed it on me so for my own sanity I had to remove myself from the toxicity.  


I had two close friends at different times growing up. The first ended up ditching me for new friends and the other did some horribly hurtful things, bullied me, and then ditched me for other people. I was horribly bullied in school and most of the teachers didn't care. I recently found someone I thought could be a friend but they only seem to care about themselves. The other people I met don't even care to reply to a message.   


I was diagnosed with depression and anxiety at age 16 but I remember things going as far back as I can recall. I went through years of medications and therapy with some awful doctors who didn't care or even called me weird for being different. I tried so hard to fix myself when really a lot of the damage is there because of other people.  


The people I dated ended up mostly being horrible people. I suffered extreme abuse, rape, starvation, physical violence, emotional abuse and neglect, financial abuse, isolation the whole thing. I spend several years essentially locked away and tortured at one time. I had to flee to a shelter to get out. I moved around a lot because by that point I was so unwell that there was no way for me to work and I had no help from anyone or the government so I ended up with stranger after stranger desperately trying to not become homeless. All of whom treated me horribly, even faced sexual harassment. All this is just a fraction of what I've been through but the post would get too long if I fit it all in. Either way through it all I still kept trying to keep going.  


I found out a couple years back that I actually have high functioning autism and adhd. Suddenly all my struggles were no longer because I didn't try hard enough and it made sense why I couldn't connect with people, why they'd use/abuse me, or just weren't interested. At first things started to get better because I wasn't beating myself up as much and I tried to work on things as best I could but honestly at some point it's just not enough. I can only do so much on my own.  


If your entire life you've been rejected, unwanted, unloved, neglected, and abused by literally everyone how are you supposed to constantly pull yourself back up out of impossibly hard situations and pits of despair. I'm only human, humans need love and acceptance at least to a degree to function. At some point I can't do it all on my own. I tried to love myself as much as I was able to despite everything telling me I'm worthless, I tried to be strong, I tried to better myself but I just don't see the point anymore in even trying. I've seen no results.  


All I wanted was just one person to love me truly, not for the purpose of using me, not as a second best option, not as a way to pet themselves on the back for being such a good person for helping a vulnerable person and then taking advantage of it. That's all I ever wanted, real love and respect. Something most people have in some way in their lives that I never got to experience for real.   


Videos of parents showing respect and love for their children kills me inside, seeing friends so happy with each other, seeing people in love and really be there for each other. Why am I not worthy of that? Is it because of the baggage I carry? Is it because of the autism, depression, adhd? or maybe because I'm scared to get hurt even more? It's not like I'm not trying the very hardest I can. I try to be a good person. I'm just not perfect. Other people aren't perfect either yet people don't want someone like me. They don't want the burden or challenges. Which I understand, I just wanted someone to care enough to really try despite those challenges in the same way I had to fight to even exist still.  


I've truly just given up now. I only felt like this once when I was in that particularly abusive situation. I still don't know how I stopped myself from jumping off a bridge then. I think because I still had a shred of hope that I was worthy to someone. I had to be stronger than any person should ever have to be and for what? I now feel the same way I did then. I'm done with talking about it, talking doesn't change anything and there's no action showing promise in sight. I have no motivation in changing myself any further to appeal to someone else, I'm either worth it or not and the consensus is not. I just don't have the strength left. The depth of my loneliness is staggering, the hurt from the constant rejection is mountainous. I just can't keep climbing and falling off on my own anymore. I'm done.  


Honestly, I think people would be glad to be rid of the burden I am. Maybe a couple will be sad for a minute but people will move on as they always have and I'm forgotten. At least then I no longer have to be in emotional and physical agony every second of every day for nothing. I don't even want to die, I love life for all it's beauty, I love my pets, I care so much for others, and I love so many things but loving other things just isn't enough for me anymore.

&lt;p&gt;If your entire life you&amp;#39;ve been rejected, unwanted, unloved, neglected, and abused by literally everyone how are you supposed to constantly pull yourself back up out of impossibly hard situations and pits of despair. I&amp;#39;m only human, humans need love and acceptance at least to a degree to function. At some point I can&amp;#39;t do it all on my own. I tried to love myself as much as I was able to despite everything telling me I&amp;#39;m worthless, I tried to be strong, I tried to better myself but I just don&amp;#39;t see the point anymore in even trying. I&amp;#39;ve seen no results.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All I wanted was just one person to love me truly, not for the purpose of using me, not as a second best option, not as a way to pet themselves on the back for being such a good person for helping a vulnerable person and then taking advantage of it. That&amp;#39;s all I ever wanted, real love and respect. Something most people have in some way in their lives that I never got to experience for real.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Videos of parents showing respect and love for their children kills me inside, seeing friends so happy with each other, seeing people in love and really be there for each other. Why am I not worthy of that? Is it because of the baggage I carry? Is it because of the autism, depression, adhd? or maybe because I&amp;#39;m scared to get hurt even more? It&amp;#39;s not like I&amp;#39;m not trying the very hardest I can. I try to be a good person. I&amp;#39;m just not perfect. Other people aren&amp;#39;t perfect either yet people don&amp;#39;t want someone like me. They don&amp;#39;t want the burden or challenges. Which I understand, I just wanted someone to care enough to really try despite those challenges in the same way I had to fight to even exist still.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve truly just given up now. I only felt like this once when I was in that particularly abusive situation. I still don&amp;#39;t know how I stopped myself from jumping off a bridge then. I think because I still had a shred of hope that I was worthy to someone. I had to be stronger than any person should ever have to be and for what? I now feel the same way I did then. I&amp;#39;m done with talking about it, talking doesn&amp;#39;t change anything and there&amp;#39;s no action showing promise in sight. I have no motivation in changing myself any further to appeal to someone else, I&amp;#39;m either worth it or not and the consensus is not. I just don&amp;#39;t have the strength left. The depth of my loneliness is staggering, the hurt from the constant rejection is mountainous. I just can&amp;#39;t keep climbing and falling off on my own anymore. I&amp;#39;m done.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Honestly, I think people would be glad to be rid of the burden I am. Maybe a couple will be sad for a minute but people will move on as they always have and I&amp;#39;m forgotten. At least then I no longer have to be in emotional and physical agony every second of every day for nothing. I don&amp;#39;t even want to die, I love life for all it&amp;#39;s beauty, I love my pets, I care so much for others, and I love so many things but loving other things just isn&amp;#39;t enough for me anymore. I need it in return. 30+ year of suffering with no end in sight. I don&amp;#39;t see a reason to continue.&lt;/p&gt;

Honestly though, I'd sacrefice alot of people if it were a magical guarantee that I'd achieve my goals in life. Other times I dream to die saving someone, that way my family might have an easier time coming to terms with the situation.

I've been through too many gut punches and even when someone tells me Im strong for enduring all the crap since childhood, I feel like they do not have the whole picture to make a proper assesment, are being obtuse or just mouthing the same old shit not wanting to really bother with the situation.

 I wont recount everything that has happened to me, only this. Things were getting better, starting to get my life back on a steady course, obviously though things went tits up. Made me realize that whatever I try wont succeed or be mediocre at best, there are many people that get dealt shit cards and still manage to pull through. I am not one of them. To see that you can do nothing while wanting to do so much is cruel.

Im trying desperately to let go of my desires, looking into stoicism and monk lifestyles. Not so I can find joy or happiness but to pass the time in relative calm by cutting myself off from all emotion so that my family at the very least doesnt have to look at a self-loathing useless mongrel.

,SuicideWatch,"I've read so many posts here and just found this subreddit a few hours ago cause I didn't know where to turn to when you feel so infinitesimally small with everything going on at the moment, it makes my problems seem insignificant and irrelevant to the bigger issues.

Now, a senior in college I honestly have no clue what I'm suppose to do. I got a chronic illness my freshman year causing me to drop out my second semester and that's where it all just fell apart. I'm at my third college, my grades keep dropping, I dont have the money to go back for my senior year and I just got out of a relationship that was the first one I truly cared about. Family life isnt any better and i just keep telling them I'll be out of their hair one way or another at the end of the summer; they obviously assume it's for college but I've been seriously considering just letting myself go and I hate it. I fit the bill of the cliche guy who jokes about being depressed and always has a smile on my face to just cover up my issues and flaws I dont want to deal with. I have always refused therapy cause I'm stubborn and for whatever reason think I'm better than it and don't need one when in reality I constantly wish I had one to talk to cause I could never bear having this conversation to any friends or family, they dont deserve to hear this and feel helpless. 

Prior to college I thought I had everything figured out. Varisty athlete, 4.0 GPA, valedictorian, every cliche thing a basic person got in high school it's not impressive looking back at it cause it seemed so easy. I've read other posts about many other people who also face the same problem of never being challenged and falling flat on their face in college.  I graduated early so I could get a headstart on college and just get into the workforce and start solving problems as I wanted to focus on environmental consultation as a chemical engineer for fortune 500 companies. I felt like I was on top of the world until realized how unprepared I was for college, for real studying, for a job, for so many things, yet I felt like the man because I did well on some dumb standardized tests.

Prior to covid I had a good thing going too, what I thought was a solid relationship and a job lined up for the summer in my field of interest. Both ended and without that job i wont have enough for college and I've been looking for jobs and getting rejected which hasnt felt great. My relationship had me very attached and when it ended I really fell deep into depression and had to tell myself it was alright even though I really loved that girl. Since quarantine I've met someone who's great and it's really a double edged sword cause talking to this girl just reminds me of my last relationship and that at any point things could come crashing down. Even worse, we make each other happy and if I leave I'd feel so bad leaving her after only getting to know her for a few months.

My friends. My friends are close and it's a small circle, just how I like it. That only makes it that much harder writing this as I think about each of them and wish I could do something special for them one last time to show them that they helped me through so much during the low points in my life. I'll be honest it's kind of lonely though because I've kept many of my same friends and made very few in college and that's been my choice but damn I wish I couldve changed that.

Something I seldom talk about is my chronic illness because I dont want it to be a personality trait of mine. I only bring it up if someone asks ad a response otherwise no one would really know. When I initially was diagnosed I was on the verge of dying and I think about it all the time if I had just passed away that night it would be much easier for everyone because it wouldnt have been by my hand and they wouldnt have been at fault for not noticing or stepping in. It's made every aspect of my life more difficult and has severely affecting my education as it's harder to focus, study, stay mentally strong, etc. In my mind, I need my degree, I wanna graduate, get a solid job and pay back my parents for everything they've given me and I feel if I keep delaying I'll never get there and I couldn't look them in their eyes if I didn't reach my goal.

Here I type, trying to find a job, figure out school, if i can pass my classes to graduate, how to go forward with this new relationship, how to fix old ones, I feel screwed and I dont wanna die, that's the worst part.

I want to be the first one of all to progress in building good habits but they won't help. In fact, they're making it more difficult.

What they don't know is that we're VERY TIRED of keeping up the family, even tho we have told them to help us with at least washing the dishes.

I didn't pay attention to online classes nor I did all the homeworks since my mind just looked for distraction. My energy was and is still very low.

If I had any type of boldness I’m me I would likely not be here anymore. I feel more like a coward and a fool with each day that passes. Holding on to a sliver of hope that JUST MAYBE things will get better soon. Well they don’t for me. I literally FEEL worse everyday. I’m not diagnosed with any mental illness or depression but something is wrong with me. I sometimes have no appetite all day and other days I’ll eat a lot. I’m constantly tired and feel like I have no energy. No matter how much sleep I get. I have no motivation for myself. I lose emotion everyday I feel like. It’s to the point where I don’t really feel anything. I don’t feel joy, happiness, love, sadness, sorrow or just good. For example I just graduated high school last week with a couple of awards/achievements. I see other people happy and celebrating but I honestly didn’t feel anything. I couldn’t have cared less. I’m tired of being tired. I forget what it’s like to be genuinely loved or even liked. That effects my ability to love or get attached to anyone or anything anymore. I refuse to put myself out there anymore. I don’t allow myself to be put in situations where I’m vulnerable with my feelings because I don’t want to be put down anymore. I am at a point where I the only thing I’m confident saying is that I don’t care about myself anymore. Any type of self confidence, self respect or motivation to be better for myself is gone. I’m such a coward that I can’t even begin to speak to someone face to face about how I think and feel, especially my family. I’m such a coward I type out all my feelings to a place where nobody knows me. I’m such a coward I’ll continue to vent/complain/talk whatever you want to call it, about my situation but have given up trying to do anything about it. I’m even such a coward I’ll complain about myself physically but won’t do anything to fix it because I care too much about what other people think. Things like my red hair, thin body type for a male, lazy eye that requires glasses, weird face, soft/quiet voice. I just give up. Nothing I’ve done has ever mattered to anyone anyways. Heck I’m almost certain I’ve never truly mattered to anyone. Again the only reason I’m still here is because I’m a just a coward. I do know there’ll come a day when I’ve had enough. I don’t know how soon that day will come if I’m being honest, but at this point it doesn’t look like it’s too far away.

It’s to the point where I don’t really feel anything. I don’t feel joy, happiness, love, sadness, sorrow or just good. For example I just graduated high school last week with a couple of awards/achievements. I see other people happy and celebrating but I honestly didn’t feel anything. I couldn’t have cared less. I’m tired of being tired. I forget what it’s like to be genuinely loved or even liked. That effects my ability to love or get attached to anyone or anything anymore. I refuse to put myself out there anymore. I don’t allow myself to be put in situations where I’m vulnerable with my feelings because I don’t want to be put down anymore. I am at a point where I the only thing I’m confident saying is that I don’t care about myself anymore. Any type of self confidence, self respect or motivation to be better for myself is gone. I’m such a coward that I can’t even begin to speak to someone face to face about how I think and feel, especially my family. I’m such a coward I type out all my feelings to a place where nobody knows me. I’m such a coward I’ll continue to vent/complain/talk whatever you want to call it, about my situation but have given up trying to do anything about it. I’m even such a coward I’ll complain about myself physically but won’t do anything to fix it because I care too much about what other people think. Things like my red hair, thin body type for a male, lazy eye that requires glasses, weird face, soft/quiet voice. I just give up. Nothing I’ve done has ever mattered to anyone anyways. Heck I’m almost certain I’ve never truly mattered to anyone. Again the only reason I’m still here is because I’m a just a coward. I do know there’ll come a day when I’ve had enough. I don’t know how soon that day will come if I’m being honest, but at this point it doesn’t look like it’s too far away. When that day comes though at least I know I’ll be able to take comfort in the fact that I did do something bold. I won’t have to suffer and be miserable anymore.&lt;/p&gt;

“I have been in that dark place. Trust me you do not want to go there. You have much more life to live. And believe me yet to get to the best part. 

Just do what you are supposed to do at your age. Learn and develop your mind. Learn to play a musical instrument. Learn to read and write a new computer language. Go outside and talk to your neighbors. Spend time with the elderly and listen to their stories. They have wisdom.

Do not worry about what other people think of you. Learn to love yourself. Accept who you are. Never limit your dreams . If somebody else has done it, you can do it too. You do not need to do anything better than anyone else. Just do your best.

Make your bed every morning. It means you have accomplished the first task of the day. Every day.

If you ever get upset with somebody and want to say something mean to them, give them a compliment instead. Hateful words will make you ill. Kind words will feed your soul.

While on the phone with some of my friends yesterday I tried to open up about how things my sister said had hurt me, and my friend was very insensitive. She said she is like my sister in her relationship with her sister and I was like her bratty younger sister. She said if I talked to her the way I talked to my sister, she would beat me up. (This was in reference to my sister coming in to the room to say goodnight to me and me giving her a bit of attitude, due to the events prior.)

Fast forward to today, I could barely concentrate at work and already was warned my performance has been bad, if I mess up again I am fired. Besides that I decided to isolate myself from everyone today after yesterdays events, and nobody cared to check on me. I can see the notifications in our group chat, and nobody cares I'm gone. I feel like this is a permanent feeling, I am only there as some sort of placeholder and nobody actually cares for me. 

I'm not actively suicidal it just feels as though if I wasn't here, people would not care because all day nobody has cared. I have no plans in life anyway, and so it's hard to feel like I want to live, all my plans have been uprooted. My friends only care that I am there for reasons any other person can fulfill.

for the past few weeks, the thought of ending my life has began to consume me on a level that actually cripples me. i don’t think this quarantine is helping my case whatsoever, but it’s given me a lot of time to sit and really absorb everything that’s happened to me during this lifetime. i’m seventeen, so i know that i don’t have a lot of life experience, but i still feel like it’s way more than the average person. i could go into detail about every traumatizing thing that’s ever happened, but i don’t think it’s really necessary for the point i’m trying to get to. my best friend was shot and killed only a year ago, totally on accident, as she was only an innocent bystander. i was on the phone with her at the time and heard everything. since then my relationship with mortality is always changing. as of late, i feel so much every day. you’d think this would be some kind of lesson as to appreciate every second, because hey, things can happen at any moment, right? i just feel so defeated all the time, i feel alone, paranoid, angry, frustrated. and when i’m not any of those things, it’s either tv static or a manic state of happiness that’s usually brief. maybe i came here just to vent without wanting a solution. i don’t know. i don’t know what to do anymore. a day doesn’t go by where i don’t think about ending my life. everything feels like a chore, the smallest things set me off. the only form of happiness i receive now is from other people. it’s momentary, at night i find myself dreadful and embarrassed, i usually start to feel like a bother to the limited people i have in my life. i don’t know what’ll make me happy. anyone else feel like this?",t2_5o5kr075,False,,0,False,yup yup read post!,[],r/SuicideWatch,False,0.0,,0,,False,t3_h059w0,False,dark,0.99,,public,1,0,{},,False,[],,False,False,,{},,False,1,,False,,False,,[],{},,True,,1591799388.0,text,0.0,,,text,self.SuicideWatch,False,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;posting this late @ nite. first post on reddit, i guess i’ll just go for it and whoever interacts, interacts. i hope this can be a space for anyone else who seems to be going thru the same thing. :•) &lt;/p&gt;

,SuicideWatch,"I live in a wonderful town full of quaint restaurants and extensive nature trails. There are so many beautiful places for me to walk, and experiencing plants and wetlands and forests and ducks makes me feel more present and alive than I ever have. Nature has inspired me to take on some really neat programming projects, too.

I make tons of money now. I have a job that so many people my age would be astonished to have. It's teaching me so much more than any job I've had before, and the company is committed to investing in me and my development. I have a great degree that got me a job right at the moment when the economy tanked and unemployment soared. I have no debt, not even student loans. I have an awesome apartment that's way beyond what a normal person of my age has - and I don't even need to split the cost with roommates.

My parents are still together and don't even fight except very rarely.

I have an amazing sister who pushes what it means to be a woman in her field and doesn't care what anyone, man or woman, has to say about her. Her fiance is pretty cool too.

I have so many great friends whom I know so closely. I think I have six or seven friendships where I know the person as well as most people get to know two or three people over a lifetime. These are people I've openly cried with, laughed with, gotten occasionally drunk with, performed with, worked with, loved. I would trust any of them with my life and I know they'd trust me with theirs. I know many of their secrets, and I can think of many pains we've each helped each other through. I feel so priveleged to be a part of their stories. I sometimes don't even realize the impact. Recently one of them gave a talk where she mentioned me and how I changed the course of her life.

I have received blessing after blessing after blessing in my life. I'm grateful for what I have and am so acutely aware of people who have it so much worse. My anxiety is even the mild kind where I don't even get panic attacks. I won't even pretend I got all this on my own. A combination of a dozen people who urged me on at every turn and supported me all the way got me here.

And I still want to kill myself.

I'm never going to find 'my person' - though I want nothing more than to be a supportive husband who's a teammate to someone wonderful, a partner through everything, a father to children who I want to teach to give more than they take from society, to teach about the beautiful things, I will never get any of that.

I'm a whole person by myself - as evidenced by all I've achieved and the relationships I have to people. But I just want this so badly.

And I genuinely feel I'll never have it. They just don't want to commit to me in particular for whatever reason. I've lost three friendships to romantic endeavors. It can be hard not to fall into that sort of thing when you're the type of person to get really close to people - sometimes you just develop closer together in a way you weren't expecting. But then something happens and it doesn't work out. It sucks. This sucks. I hate it. I'm so tired. I can hardly stand growing apart from people naturally, cutting off a close friendship because they or I can't deal anymore? That's devastating every time.

I care so much. I'm tired of caring. Why do I care?

I'm not gonna go through with it. I wouldn't know how to even try. It would just let everyone down anyway.

You know what's dumb? When I was maybe 10 or 12 I tried to hang myself with a belt in my closet. I didn't understand the fall was what killed you so I just hung a belt loop on a coat hook and hung by tiny body by the neck while crying until I gave up.

,SuicideWatch,"So, for some time I had some plans for things I wanted to do in quarantine. I wanted to create a YouTube or a Twitch channel and stream a little bit everyday (mostly for fun), I wanted to start studying a new language, learn some new skills (mostly drawing and sculpting)... etc.

But unfortunately I don’t have any money to afford any of the things I wanted to do, and my parents are only spending on what’s REALLY necessary. I’m not in college, so there’s not even online classes. Everyone around me is doing something, or starting to do something but I’m just unable to do anything, and the worst part is that for the first time I actually wanted to do something.

I know I should ger help,  and I know I dont even listen to my own rhetoric that I give to my clients . &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I want to die, but I&amp;#39;m afraid of it just the same . I wish my life was happier , but it has been tragedy after tragedy . I dont have anyone to talk to either .&lt;/p&gt;

,SuicideWatch,"This is my goodbye letter. I too ashamed to write such a hideous letter to my family or friends, but i so desperately want someone to hear this so i'm writing strangers of the internet. I'm going to write about every small detail that led me to this moment. I know this post is really long winded with a few tangents but please read through.

I'm in year 12 my final year of school and it's been the worst year of my life. My depression and anxiety started last year in year 11. I was hit a foot ball during a lunch time and ended up with a concussion. I took two weeks off of school, this would ultimately be the start of my downfall spiralling downhill. Because of this i started to fall behind with exams just around the corner. Everyone else was already studying for exams but i was still busy studying for late tests and doing assignments that i missed. In the end my only options was to wing the exams but in another stroke of bad luck I caught the flu on the day of exams. I was unbelievable tired, my eyes were going dim. I tried going up to first aid to get my get some paracetamol to help but they said they were not allowed to give out medication. So I went out when it was freezing to the local pharmacy in order to get some medication. This made my condition far worse. I ended up falling asleep in the chemistry written exam at the start of the day and the practical exam at the end of the day. Needless to say i failed exams.   


After this is when my depression started. I could never fall asleep because I would always stay awake thinking about school. You know that feeling when you're just awake at night and suddenly you remember an embarrassing memory and start cringing? That was me on a more severe level thinking about school. Before the exams I'd most of the time gotten the highest marks in the class but suddenly began to doubt myself. I slowly began to skip classes and every class i skipped would make it harder to go back. I was always a goody two shoes so I was afraid of coming back to class and the teacher calling me out in front of everyone for my unexplained absences (they had a tendency to do this). Each time i tried going back to class i started hyperventilating before i got to the door and never ended up entering. I went to see a GP to try and get help but it felt like he didn't care. His response to me was ""why do you have depression? Why do you have anxiety about class? If you think people are judging you just ignore them. Just ignore the exam result and you will be fine."" I don't think he understood that my anxiety and depression was due to the fact that i couldn't ignore my exam result, that i couldn't ignore what other people thought about me. But i still ended up seeing him every week because he was the only GP close by and he eventually prescribed medication. The only catch was he said that he would not give me medication unless I brought a parent to an appointment. I told my parents about my depression, they didn't believe me but still when to the appointment. After the appointment i got my prescription and thought i could get my medication and continue on happily with my life, that was not the case. 

My parents at this point believed i had depression but didn't think it was severe enough to warrant medication since you have to take the medication for a long time. They convinced me to not take the medication, i have not talked to the GP since. Instead i started talking to my school counsellor. I'm going to be honest i didn't find much help with the sessions with her. Most of the tips i ended up leaving with were exercise in the morning, belly breathing and meditation. I eventually stopped seeing her too. My last resort was going to an organisation called head space. They provide free psychologist and psychiatrist help however there is a long wait list. By the time i was able to get in touch with a psychologist the school year was coming to an end with end of year exams. I talked to the psychologist and a bit reassured going into exams but when time came, i messed up. Even though i skipped classes i would still study by myself so I thought i was prepared. But during exams my mind went blank i started having panic attacks and hyperventilating. I told my teachers what was going on and provided my medical certificates so they let me do it another date in a private room. This didn't help, my hand were shaking every single exam, i just wanted to give up. I did well on other tests and assignments but had another disappoint result on my exams worth 50% of my final grade.    


Through this ordeal I had one shinning light, my English teacher, Mr Hubber. He modified the exam for me and would guide me through it. I panicked and threw up during the exam but he didn't force me to do it anymore. He said he could estimate my exam result using my assignments and tests. We talked for a long time and i started having hope again. He was the best teacher i ever had and English was the only subject i did well on in the end. Even though I didn't do well on other subjects because of the exam, doing well in English gave me hope to do better.   


So began my year 12. My English teacher sadly had to move to Melbourne this year but he said he talked to my new English teachers and made sure they would be understanding of me. I'm not sure how the school screwed this one up so badly, but for my final and most important year of school i got two English teachers sharing a class, both new to the school. One would teach on Mondays, Tuesdays and Wednesdays on odd weeks, the other Wednesdays, Thursdays and Fridays on even weeks. It was horrible. They both didn't know what they were doing as they were knew to the school and every time there was a question they would say ""i'll write that down and ask the English coordinator later"".   


Then the Covid-19 crisis came. We all moved to online classes. For and introvert with anxiety online classes seemed to come in handy. We did all of our tests online and submitted our assignments online. I started feeling a bit better about my self until one day my dad got an email from my English teachers. The email said that it had been a month already and I hadn't submitted my assignment yet. I already completed it and submitted it so I didn't know what the English teachers were talking about. I ended up apologising to my dad and resubmitted it. The problem is that you lose 5% each day with an overdue assignment so i'm wondering why they told me a month later instead of the day after it was due. I still remained positive thinking it was only one assignment, it's not my fault, i completed it on time. Another month later my dad got another email saying that very same assignment still hasn't been submitted. My dad emailed back and forth several times with overwhelming evidence that i had completed my assignment on time. With At least 20 emails back and forth with my dad, my English teachers didn't even directly email me once. My dad told them to talk to me directly instead of through him but they didn't listen. Apparently they didn't trust me but for some reason trusted my dad. I began skipping English class because i hated seeing their faces. My anxiety started to build up again and this mindset spread to my other classes. It may seem over nothing but my mind was so fragile at the time and still is. Anything negative would just tip me over. after a while face to face classes began again but there were still optional online classes, i chose online. But i was the only one doing online in all of my classes. The entire class was there and I was the only one displayed in the meeting in front of class. I would get called out by my classmates for not going to school and made fun of. The teachers would pick on me to answer questions to make sure i was participating at home. I hated online class so much but i was also too afraid to come back after all this time. So I just stopped going to class altogether. The teachers would post the recorded lessons on Microsoft streams and i would just watch those instead. I still learnt all the things necessary just like my classmates the only difference was i didn't attend class live.    


Today my coordinator at school called my dad told him that I've missed too many classes and voided all my subjects. I tried to explain but the words couldn't come out. My dad was furious at me. He shouted ""WHAT DO I HAVE TO DO FOR YOU TO LEARN PROPERLY?"" I couldn't answer. All my work has been for nothing. I've just failed school. I knew not attending class was wrong, but I still tried, I still went over all the work and now its all gone down the drain. I have to go in tomorrow to talk to my teachers which I hate. I'm beyond tired especially knowing my work has been for nothing. i just want to give up now. At night when my family is asleep i'm going to sneak out and end it all.

Does that make sense?

I also *know* that “It gets better.” I experienced a very bad phase of depression a few years back and life did get better eventually, or rather, I found passions to distract myself from it.

&lt;p&gt;A lot of people on this sub, and people struggling with suicidal ideation in general, seem to have “nothing going for them,” like unemployed, single, no friends or family. But I have grown up privileged, got good grades in school, and am going to a great university. I have things I would like to do in the future and I am not completely and utterly hopeless. And this is not to say that I am better than those other people, in fact, I think that my being handed a lot of opportunities in life and the fact that I’m &lt;em&gt;still&lt;/em&gt; suicidal makes me less worthy of wanting to off myself. Does that make sense?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also &lt;em&gt;know&lt;/em&gt; that “It gets better.” I experienced a very bad phase of depression a few years back and life did get better eventually, or rather, I found passions to distract myself from it. But right now, my depression and suicidal thoughts are at its worst, and even though I know that things will eventually be better again, I just don’t think living is worth it if I’ll be back here at the bottom again sometime.

If while reading this post the title seems somehow unfitting, I am sorrry, I am not good and thinking of titles, especially for such a topic.

Firstly, I would like to apologize in advance if this post doesn't necessarily belong in here but I feel like this should be the right place. Secondly, I would also like to apologize in advance for any grammatical or spelling errors or if some sentences sound weird, I am not a native english speaker.  
Also, going forth in this post I will literally write what comes to my mind, so please also excuse the structure if it is weird.

For anyone reading this, looking to help me, this is not a post where I specifically seek help or have suicidal thoughts or anything along the line. This post is much rather meant for anyone seeking help but is too scared to reach out to anyone or people trying to get a better understanding of how to help others in need of help.

In march this year, after many months of going back and forth to and from the hospital, always seemingly improving his health only to then have it worsening again, my grandpa passed away. To me he was always the biggest inspiration in life, simply because of the way his life went, how he was always looking at the bright side of things and always worked hard to make everything as good as possible. Having heard about his death I was in an emotional slump. I had (and still sometimes have) trouble sleeping because I dream about him and the emotional backlash isn't easy to handle. Just being at home and remembering all the times he visited us in our house, seeing him sit where he always sat, to this day it is one of the hardest things for me to just accept. The first few weeks after his death were the hardest on me. I tend to close my real feeling off from family and friends because I don't feel the need to rely on anyone to handle my affairs. While I understand that this isn't a particularily healthy behaviour it always worked for me but as a result I am somewhat emotionally distant from others.   
During this period I wasn't exactly having suicidal thoughts, but everything just felt really different and heavy on my mind, if that makes sense. I guess it was the sadness weighing down on me. This was the first time in now 21 years of my life where I thought about actively seeking someone to talk to just so I could tell somebody but as I mentioned, there wasn't really anyone like that for me.  
So, as I always did, I tried my best to sort out my feelings, picked myself up from the emotional slump I was in and told myself that I will do my best to continue on the way of life my grandpa set as an example with his own. Since then I also tried to reach out to others, not to seek help from them, but rather to help them if they're in need of help. I experienced the loss of a loved one, which, without wanting to belittle anyone else, has probably struck me more than some others would be. Doing that I was able to talk to a few people about their emotions and emotional state and could even see some of them improving their condition and evidently looking more positive. It left me with a feeling of acomplishment, a feeling that it is possible to help people in their psychological well-being. 

Over the past three months I felt like I improved as a human being. I got my life together, started studying seriously for university, started working out and obviously continued to provide support to those that asked me for it. And just to clarify, those were, againg without wanting to belittle things, relatively minor problems, ranging from ""I feel like my parents don't understand me as a person."" to something along the lines of ""I won't manage to finish my studies/get a good job/have a good life."" While those may seem small, I want to advise everyone to not overlook such seemingly ""trivialities"". They can be the most taxing on the mental health of a person as we ourselves are constantly reminding ourselves of those.  
Well, everything seemed to be going well until two days ago one of the best friends of a close friend of mine commited suicide by jumping in front of a train. Obviously, I offered him my support, telling him he can always talk to me if he needs someone to talk to and all the things one might say in such a situation. But honestly, it was the first time I was confronted with a suicide in a, more or less, direct way. I was at a loss about what to do, what I can do for my friend. How I can help him. It helps talking about it to someone, just having someone that listens, but I wasn't sure if that was all I could do. For the first time in my whole life, I really understood what it meant for a person to feel powerless despite wanting to do something. The worst thing about the whole situation is the fact, that my friend feels directly responsible for his death because they had a fight in that night, which led to his friend going off alone. Throughout the night he was asking if someone could come to him just so someone would be there for him but there was no one responding to him. No one who took it serious enough. In the end, because he was all alone, he took his own life by jumping in front of an incoming train. It must be one of the worst feelings a human can feel. Feeling that you are responsible for one your best friends' suicide. I can't even imagine how hard it must be for him if I am already struggling to manage the situation for myself. I talked to my friend about it and more importantly about the person who committed suicide. He was known for sometimes being emotionally unstable and having depressive phases, but overall he was a cheerful guy. Always up for going out into the city and just having fun. Always one of the main reasons everyone was having a good time. Always lossening the mood and making it feel more comfortable. In the end it turned out that he wasn't all that happy-go-lucky.

But, as 2020 has shown time and time again, it can always get worse. After the shock two days ago, today we got the message that yesterday a close family friend of ours took his own life. Three weeks ago it was his 50th birthday and, cruel as fate can be, a couple days before that he was diagnosed with a tumor. It broke him completely. Immediately he fell into depression and honestly it was one of the worst cases I've seen. Our whole family and multiple other friends, as well as his own obviously, were there to support him from the beginning. I can only imagine how it must've felt to get diagnosed with a tumor but we tried our best to be there for him. The doctors said that he was lucky they found it now as it could still be relatively safely removed and he will most probably recover from it. But despite our best efforts to make him feel better, make him have a positive mindset about it, as is now evident, it wasn't enough. Once again, after just having felt powerless, I once again felt weak. Nothing I've done had the expected result. I don't know what more I, or rather we as his friends, could've done more to help him. Up to this point he lived a good life. He had two kids, a loving wife and, if I may say so also about myself, good, caring friends. In the end it was us, good, loving, caring family and friends, who were powerless to help him. We tried our best but nothing seemed to improve his mental health. Day after day his condition seemed to have worsened once again and at times I asked myself if we should be more aggressive with our help. Not only waiting for him to come ask for our help and small initiatives from our side, but doing more for him. Not waiting for the obvious signal but reacting to the small signals he was unconciously giving us. But from reading and hearing about different cases of mental problems and learning that sometimes offering and doing too much can worsen the problem we decided to take the ""safe route"". Tried slowly making him feel the positivity of life. Now, we blame ourselves for not taking more actions when our current methods were evidently not working. What now remains for us is to learn to live with the situation as it is. There's nothing we can do and I honestly believe that rationally speaking (if that makes sense) we did the right thing with not pushing too far. Nonetheless, this feeling of guilt will always remain. 

What I hope you as readers and also I, constantly trying to improve myself, will take away from this is the fact that it is always worth offering help to others, if they're in need of help. It is always worth asking for help, if you're having trouble managing your mental health, even if the problems may seem minor. Talk to a friend, post anonymously on the internet, maybe even talk to someone you're not as familiar with but who is willing to listen to you. Try calling the suicide hotline if you're really having trouble, they are here for you. Just to listen to you and help you through a tough time. There are a lot of people willing to help you and make you see value in life again. Finding something that will make you view the world with more positivity, be it a pet, meeting an old friend again, going on a walk with an elderly person from your neighbourhood that you've never really talked to before or maybe even a random stranger you always see on your way to work that is also trying his best in the same world you're currently living in, is always worth it. Find something for yourself to help you stay connected to the world, something that makes you feel like you still have a reason to go on living, even if it may seem insignificant to others. What is most important is that it helps you.

This year has been very taxing on my mental health but I managed to turn myself into a better version of myself than I was before and going forth I hope that you can achieve the same. Believing that it can get better is the first step. 

I am sorry for the length of this post, I didn't really think there was so much I wanted to share that was bothering me. No matter what you felt when reading this and what you took away from this post, I believe that you will grow as a person and in the near future stand stronger than ever.

Best regards

,SuicideWatch,"It's been 6 months since I attempted suicide. Got drunk by myself on Christmas, went to a frozen pond, ran to the middle of it and broke the ice with my feet until I fell in it. Somehow, I got out. Don't remember exactly what happened but I got out. I remember constatly passing out on my way back home. Couldnt feel my feet or any part of my body. Fell asleep on the sidewalk for a bit, then crawled back to my appartment when my neighbors saw me and called an ambulance. My heart stopped in the ambulance. They were able to bring me back. Then spent 3 weeks in a psych ward. Didnt tell anyone. To give some context, Im from a country in Africa but was living in the U.S at that point. I lived there for 9 years. All of my family is in my home country so I could easily hide it from them.

 I have some friends that I lost due to a break up with my ex. Her and I were friends since 2012 then started dating in 2015 and we had the same group of friends. When we broke, because she cheated on me, all of our friends started to drift away from me. I didnt tell them she cheated on me because I didnt want them to stop talking to her but I don't know what she told them. Anyways, not gonna get into the détails because it's a long story. Her cheating on me was hard and what it made it harder is loosing my friends. Also my family was 3000 miles away. I spent 4 months in solitude before I decided to end my life. I was also unemployed. I just had finished my masters in Engineering and I was having a hard time finding a job because I'm international. I was in the U.S with a student Visa. I was broke. I was barely paying rent. I sold all my belongings, including my mattress so I could pay rent. At one point I didn't have what to eat. My weight dropped from 160lb to 110lb. I cut myself on several occasions then the day of christmas, everyone was with their families and I was alone. So I decided to end it.

 I survived and after I got out of the psych ward, I left the U.S and came back home to visit my family. I have a great offer for a research position while pursuing a Phd in engineering in Germany.  And im just waiting for the lockdown to end so I can start a new chapter in my life. Everything seems to be better but everytime I remember everything that happened I start crying and all the feelings I felt when I wanted to end my life come back. It's been such a challenge to live my life normaly. Anything can trigger those thoughts. And I don't want to have those thoughts. 

I'm wondering if I should tell my family. Mental health is not a thing in my country/culture, I don't know how they'll take it. My ex talked to me recently and I have such an urge to tell her about the pain that she caused me.

,SuicideWatch,"I hate being black and I'm not trolling either, I feel like I am trapped in this life, and there's no way of escape. When I see Black slavery with pictures of black slaves holding monkeys, Blacks who were in chains, and whipped. Made me sick that I'm part of the same race, It disgusts me. Even without White supremacy existing I'd still be ashamed and sick that I belong to the black race. To even think that Black Americans are proud to be descended from such treachery. Also makes me very sick, How blacks act like animals I personally and sincerely hate my own race, it's history, and it's culture as of today. I'd rather be any other race than Black. 
    They victimize themselves and it sickens me,  the women shake their butts and this sickens me, they are uncivilized and it sickens me. 
   For Christ's sake even American Indians owned slaves. How can I truly accept that about myself, I'm fucked and feel like it's time to call it quits in life. I hope you all are fucking proud. 
      Everyone tries to be white and I don't blame them!  It angzrs me to the point I want to cry. My life is nothing more than a fucking joke a huge gigantic comedy. 
  I can't express my hatred to my family cause that would make me feel bad,  If you are any other fucking race than black be proud!  Quit fucking complaining you have it easy. Blacks though I'd rather have gone the trail of tears as a Native American than be black. 
    I'd be happy to be a white slave in the middle east than be black. There's nothing I like about myself except for the little white and the large percentage of Native American in me. 
     It's fucked up but I see why people kill themselves this life is shitty. I can't even express more about how I feel about this topic. I hate being black and would have rather not been born than be in this skin in this fucking flesh. 
    I am not skin bleaching myself, cause that doesn't make me white or Latino, I won't straighten my hair cause I'll still be seen as black. 
    I honestly feel like if there isn't a genetically alteration for people I'll call it quits in life I want to hold faith to humanity but I'm beginning to doubt if I'll ever the chance to change my ethnicity but through plastic surgery. 
         Which still doesn't change me! Ugh, don't tell me I should feel different my life is honestly over. I can't escape my ethnicity but by death.

When I see Black slavery with pictures of black slaves holding monkeys, Blacks who were in chains, and whipped. Made me sick that I&amp;#39;m part of the same race, It disgusts me. Even without White supremacy existing I&amp;#39;d still be ashamed and sick that I belong to the black race. To even think that Black Americans are proud to be descended from such treachery. Also makes me very sick, How blacks act like animals I personally and sincerely hate my own race, it&amp;#39;s history, and it&amp;#39;s culture as of today. I&amp;#39;d rather be any other race than Black. 
    They victimize themselves and it sickens me,  the women shake their butts and this sickens me, they are uncivilized and it sickens me. 
   For Christ&amp;#39;s sake even American Indians owned slaves. How can I truly accept that about myself, I&amp;#39;m fucked and feel like it&amp;#39;s time to call it quits in life. I hope you all are fucking proud. 
      Everyone tries to be white and I don&amp;#39;t blame them!  It angzrs me to the point I want to cry. My life is nothing more than a fucking joke a huge gigantic comedy. 
  I can&amp;#39;t express my hatred to my family cause that would make me feel bad,  If you are any other fucking race than black be proud!  Quit fucking complaining you have it easy. Blacks though I&amp;#39;d rather have gone the trail of tears as a Native American than be black. 
    I&amp;#39;d be happy to be a white slave in the middle east than be black. There&amp;#39;s nothing I like about myself except for the little white and the large percentage of Native American in me. 
     It&amp;#39;s fucked up but I see why people kill themselves this life is shitty. I can&amp;#39;t even express more about how I feel about this topic. I hate being black and would have rather not been born than be in this skin in this fucking flesh. 
    I am not skin bleaching myself, cause that doesn&amp;#39;t make me white or Latino, I won&amp;#39;t straighten my hair cause I&amp;#39;ll still be seen as black. 
    I honestly feel like if there isn&amp;#39;t a genetically alteration for people I&amp;#39;ll call it quits in life I want to hold faith to humanity but I&amp;#39;m beginning to doubt if I&amp;#39;ll ever the chance to change my ethnicity but through plastic surgery. 
         Which still doesn&amp;#39;t change me! Ugh, don&amp;#39;t tell me I should feel different my life is honestly over. I can&amp;#39;t escape my ethnicity but by death.

,SuicideWatch,"Hello Reddit,

This may come across as a little sob story/rant/edgy post to you, but to me, it could be the final entry into my diary before I do something a bit unorthodox. If you want the gist of this post, see tl;dr below.

&amp;#x200B;

I am currently in a tight spot and have been considering suicide for the past 4 years of my life. Right now, I am 18 years old and like half of the entire world due to the concurring COVID19 pandemic, am cooped up home mostly finding anything to do. (Surprise surprise, I hadn't)

Now, what is this post all about?

I wanted to see if my death would send a warning and a wakeup call to my parents. 

My father is currently unemployed and has been for the past 10 years but before that, he was a charming and hardworking man. He's always work round the clock to satisfy all our wants and needs. As a matter of fact, my childhood was very, very privileged thanks to his grit and determination plus the added bonus of having a lucrative salary due to him working abroad. We'd be fed a heckton of pizzas and spoiled with toys that the cool kids had back then (PSP, anyone?)

My mother was another story. She was a stubborn, manipulating hypocrite. While she certainly raised us with discipline, it was extremely difficult to play by her rules, thanks in part to her short temper and quite frankly, questionable intelligence. She'd force us to do chores that she should be doing, while she would stay in the living room with her feet up, watching drama and/or playing Farmville or something along those lines. Any attempts to reason that we were tired would result in us being penalized playtime or forced to take a beating. 

Even in our studies, we could never seem to impress her. Get an 8/10? She'd berate you and say 'You could've gotten a perfect score!'. Fail and she'll remark 'do you want to grow up in the streets picking up trash?' Needless to say, I became numb throughout my childhood thanks to this standard.

Anyways, my dad was the real MVP. He managed to spoil 3 kids and save a lot of money in the bank. Before returning to our home country in 2011, he invested in a business and bought a couple of apartments to rent out so he'd have passive income after retiring. 

Keeping things short, everything he's ever invested upon went dry and lost most of his money. This plunged him into depression. His marriage also went sour, parting ways with my mom in 2014 due to financial issues. As things break down before him, so did his attitude. He started becoming cold, unapproachable, and very short to temper. Sometimes we'd argue over the littlest of things and he'd threatened to kick us out of our home.

I lived with it anyway.

I was lucky to graduate high school before being qualified in 3 universities, but my other two siblings? There's uncertainty, all thanks to my dad.

He has literally run out of money and currently living off my grandmother's pension. When the pension wasn't enough to secure my siblings' education, they sold off the house. We were split. They were relocating into a rural area whilst I, unfortunately, lived with my mom. 

Given that we hadn't been together for a strong 6 years, I'd expected her to change. 

Boy was I wrong.

I get limited computer time (understandably so as she is struggling with money herself), but what's unforgiving is she would pull out her hypocritical, two-faced side. She'd randomly be pissed and constantly remark ""You're like your father, lazy and I'm afraid you'll probably grow to be like him"".

Over the past 7 months that I have been with her, I have felt never felt this low. Admitted that our lives were on a tumble the past few years, she was the catalyst for my trip to suicide. It was the way that she raised us during our childhood that I lost my drive, any passion I had for playing and developing games (she sees this as a waste of time).

Today, I am planning to go outside and go for a casual stroll, trying to see the purpose of life before plotting out any means of suicide.

I had written 4 letters: One directed to my father, ironically telling him that there is hope as long as you're breathing and have not killed yourself, then you still have the means, strength, and resources to still work and provide despite the fact that he'd only have 2 children by the time I send this letter. Additionally, I noted that I would've made him proud given a little more time. 

The other one is to my mother, telling her that if she is truly a christian, then she should change her attitude to reflect that, and that she also still has 2 children to care for - warning her that if she fails, then the other two could be on the same course as I am. (She loves the other two more than me)

The other two are to my siblings, friends and teachers, thanking them for everything I've learned and experienced in this short-lived life. 

Now here's the question for you. Do you think that killing myself would really solve anything? I would have proven to my mother that I have a stronger will to do what I want to do than she ever will in her entire life; my father would hopefully 'wake-up', citing that he has had counseling and medication and more support from his mother, something which I never got; and my siblings whom I will tell to stay strong and hope that my death would impose change, and that following my steps should be the last of your options.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm done. I give up. These past 12 months have been the worst year of my life and I'm at the end of my rope.

My grandmother who raised me passed away last year from Alzheimer's. I had been visiting her at the nursing home three times a week and watching her slow decline really killed me inside. Her death put such a strain on my mother she had a heart attack. I moved in with her to take care of her and it caused me and my wife of nineteen years to divorce. I went from being with my kids every single day to seeing them on the weekend. It hurts so bad. I met a new girl and fell in love with her and she became pregnant. We lost the baby at 7 months and had to deliver her and everything. Worst experience of my life. My fifteen-year-old dog died and I didn't get to spend her final days with her. She was my companion and I took her everywhere with me but I couldn't separate her from my children even though it killed me inside. I'm being absolutely destroyed by the courts and put through the ringer for every penny I make.

Things were getting back to my new normal and then this Coronavirus bullshit started. I took a pay cut of $1000 a check while still trying to be the sole breadwinner for two households and being put down by me ex-wife because it affected her standard of living. I've been stressed out for months. I finally got to go back to work last week, and at the end of the week, I got the call for the HR meeting. Loss of revenue and I make too much money. They used me at a reduced rate for three months. A Contractor is taking over my position. I put my blood, sweat, and tears into my career and this company for ten years, and I was told to get lost with two months of severance and escorted out of the building in front of everyone like a criminal. I have a heart condition and I can't afford my medication and my health insurance for my whole family is gone. I was making well over 100K a year, I can't just go find another job like that. This stressed me out so bad I caused a huge fight with my new gf and I don't know if we're going to make it.

My life has become a fucking country song and I can't take it anymore. I'm just waiting for the next hit to come. I want to just not wake up. I have a good life insurance policy that would take care of my kids and I'm seriously considering ending it before I run completely out of money and fail them yet again.

,SuicideWatch,"Hello, I feel like talking into the void helps a bit, people don't necessarily have to say anything but just know it is how I feel. 

I would like to think I was a happy individual growing up at least until I got to freshman year of high school. I would get panic attacks over the smallest inconvenience or even for no reason. My hands would get clammy, heart rate would increase, my hands would tingle, and I would hyperventilate. In and out of the doctor's offices for months to figure out the reason for these instances. Eventually, I was diagnosed with Generalized Anxiety disorder. Now albeit, I did not really have suicidal thoughts right of the bat I usually did really well coping with the fact that I was nervous pretty much all the time. 

The suicidal thoughts did not come until maybe junior year of High school. I'd think of death every now and then. I would always think that maybe if I were to cease to exist I wouldn't have to worry all the time, I would be stuck in this constant thought process of going throu all my past decisions trying to calculate all the different possiblities of what could have happened if I done something different. Or be stuck in the future where I would worry about about things that have not happens yet, and things I can't control.

After I high school, I jumped straight into college where I spent 2 years having the most fun and stressful time in my life. However, it was in those 2 years it was the first time that I actually got close to acting on my suicidal thoughts. I can't really recall what pushed me so close but I do remember that I was coming back to my dorm but instead of taking the elevator (my dorm had 6 floors) I took the stairs. I got to my floor (5th floor) and I stopped then decided to go up a floor and when I got to the 6th floor i could see the door to the roof. I thought to myself, ""This is the time I could stop being so stressed, all I would have to do is walk out that door and take a step off the ledge of the building.""  I got to the point to where I had put my hand on the door ready to walk out of it but I stopped myself, instead I walked back down to my floor and sat on the steps next to the door to my floor and contemplated why I chose to stop myself. To this day I am not sure what caused me to back down from doing it, maybe I wasn't ready to take the leap, maybe I didn't want to hurt the ones that did care for me, maybe I felt like I still had things to finish be for I go, idk but regardless I stopped my self.
I the next time I got close to attempting is when I was getting ready to go back to college for my 3 year, something had happened and the school had screwed up my financial aid which caused me to not be able to go back. I grew up in a poor household and am still relatively poor but am making it by the skin of my teeth. So going to college was a first for my family so when I wasn't able to go back it destroyed me. The night that I found it I would not be able to got back I stared at my medication I take for my anxiety and depression, opened them up and poured them into my hand intending to take every single one of them at once. I ended up talking myself out of it because my mother was in the next room, I did not want her to see me on the floor overdosed. She didn't deserve that, she is the greatest mother a person could ask for. 

Now to address the most recent happenings. I recently split with my girlfriend of almost 4 years and we have a beautiful daughter who just turned 1, 2 months ago. The reason we split is because after being scared to tell her how my mental state is regarding my anxiety, depression and suicidal thoughts. I was always scared that she would treat me different and when I finally told her my thoughts she said we were over, telling me I need to get help and that until I get help I would not get to see my daughter. As you possibly guessed I didn't take that well, I did my best to get her to under that they were apart of my support structure but she wasn't having it, eventually not responding to text or calls. That lead to that night I took a knife to my wrist, held it there pushing it into my skin knowing that all I had to do is drag it up my arm and do the same to the other arm. However, I couldn't do it, I don't want my daughter to grow up with out a father like I did. Now, keep in mind this all happened within the spand of 2 months. That being said, I have gotten help since we split and she has realized that she was a bit extreme in basically holding our daughter hostage and I do get to have my daughter. 

Yet, even though I get to see my daughter and that is what matters to me. I still have that night replay in my head all the time, I can't even look at my ex because it hurts so much because she made me feel like a monster. I use the techniques I aquired from the therapist but it is temporary, the thoughts come back and I have regretfully started self harm because if I consentrate on that pain I don't have to feel the pain of reliving that night. I am scared that this self harm is gonna be the doorway to my eventual suicide. I don't want that to happen, I don't want to leave this world, I just want the stress, pain and thoughts to go away. (Pertaining to the split and other aspects of life.)

I don&amp;#39;t take pity upon myself, my story isnt as bad as the others on here, I&amp;#39;m just overreacting about everything i guess, but i wanted to let someone know, you have so much more to accomplish, i believe in you, and im happy for all your future accomplishments that will come, please dont end up like me, sadly, im at the end of my rope very soon it feels like... I&amp;#39;m scared, really scared, but i guess the thought should comfort me if i was suicidal? Idk anymore, but yea&lt;/p&gt;

,SuicideWatch,"I feel like I’m drowning, I’ve spent so much of my life pushing forward, waiting for things to get better, I’m burnt out and exhausted. 

I told myself that I’d be happier once I was living away from my abusive parents, that I’d be happier if I went to therapy and tried to figure out my grief surrounding my dads death when I was 16, that I’d be happier once his girlfriend stopped trying to sue me, that I’d be happier once I was living with my boyfriend, that I’d be happier once I broke up with said boyfriend. That way of these things would be the “push” I needed to get my life on track and be happy. How much has to happen for me to finally realize that I’m the problem? It feels like tonight is when I finally put it all together and realized I’m the common denominator for all my problems and I don’t know where to go from here. 

I made sure I had an animal I loved and cared about before I even moved out, I knew I needed something that needed me to stop me from killing myself. I made sure I extensively researched any animal I brought into my home and went to extremes to make sure each animal was taken care of in the best possible way. Fish got weekly water changes, filter cleans, bloodworms, high quality fish food. Leopard gecko got a 40 gallon tank with the heating pad, wax worms, meal worms, crickets, the whole nine yards. All my parrots are given high quality food, have an expensive $300 bird tree, got fresh fruits and vegetables regularly, lots of time outside of the cage. Cat had an automatic feeder, scratch pad in every room, a little bit of wet food every night, dog got a million toys, giant kennel, frozen Kong toys, specially mixed food with tons of healthy stuff. 

It kept me alive. I felt like I couldn’t die, I couldn’t milk myself, because I trusted absolutely nobody else in the world to care for my animals like I would. I knew I was the only person that would care enough to do all of this for them and if I died anyone else who took care of them wouldn’t do it as well as me. And now even a random shmuck would probably do a better job than me. My ex kept the cat, my gecko is fine but no longer spoiled, my fish tanks are kinda gross and need to be cleaned but I can’t find the fucking motivation, my birds are still getting their most basic needs met but I hardly ever let them have out of cage time anymore, and if I do it’s not for very long, fuck. I even forget to feed my dog sometimes! I had to start having my Alexa remind me because I felt so terrible one night when I went to go to sleep and saw him whining at his treats and realized he was probably so hungry because I totally spaced feeding him. (My brother is staying with me and would make sure they are taken care of it I fail to do so before anyone calls animal services or anything on me. I’m not abusing my animals, I have a high standard of what I believe animals deserve to be treated like that and right now I feel like I’m not meeting it.)

Everything requires so much energy and I feel like I just don’t have it anymore. The only thing that kept me alive for years is now just a constant reminder that I’m a fuck up and I love all my animals so dearly and feel like I’m doing such a terrible fucking job. 

I’m taking so fucking long to get my associates degree when I have every opportunity in the world to be successful and here I am, 3 years in, for the last two semesters I’ve just been taking random bullshit classes because I have no fucking clue what else to do with my life and applying for graduation means deciding what I want to get a bachelors in and finding a university I want to go to, and I just don’t fucking know anymore. Or getting a shitty fucking job where my managers are constantly wanting me to stay late and come in on every day off for $7.50 an hour with shitty coworkers who don’t give a fuck and constantly put me in shitty positions where I have to work to live and live to work. And customers who berate me and tell me that having a septum piercing makes me ugly and they pierce cows noses to drag them around, or who want specifically male crickets only and make me dig through thousands of crickets and then when I finally get all males make me get new ones for bullshit reasons, or come in and say they’ll flush a pleco down the toilet once it gets too big, or want to buy a pet rat as a chew toy for their dog, or want to release hand fed domesticated doves into the wild after their wedding as if animals are just props. Or they’ll want me to get customers in for appointments where someone else can sell them a car and I get paid dirt and work constant 12 hour shifts and even though I do all the talking with the customer and bring them in, the salesmen who always hit on me even though they have girlfriends are making three figures while I struggle to pay my rent.

,SuicideWatch,"I just can't do it anymore. I've been struggling for years on top of years on top of years and I just can't handle anything anymore.

I just recently turned 17, and thought I'd be a senior in high school, but my grades are so terrible I don't think that's happening. Since I was young, I've always been depressed. My now divorced parents were always fighting, my mom was abusive and to this day doesn't see it. Whenever you bring up her abusive past, she refuses to even acknowledged it happened. Always ""That never happened, stop trying to ruin my name."" and whatnot. Things only got worse for her when I came out. I was bullied relentlessly in elementary through middle school, and could never make any genuine friends.

A few months ago, I planned to kill myself. I was going to jump off a bridge into the freeway. Two days before though, I confided in a friend who was also suicidal, about my plan. They ended up telling the school nurse and I got sent to the hospital and put on suicide watch. That was the first time I ever received treatment of any kind, and on my way to the hospital my mom told my father that I was doing it for attention. From there, I spent a little while in a mental hospital. Right when I was released and had a whole plan on when I was supposed to go back to school, not only did I get run over by my own mom's car, quarantine started and I ended up trapped at home. Online school has been absolute hell. I can't keep up, and I have so many missing assignments, it's not even laughable. I've gotten countless emails from teachers and staff asking me to at least try and I did. But I have breakdowns every time.

I should've been on anti-depressants by now. But because my mom is so against them because of all the bad things she's read online, she refuses to let me take them. She keeps thinking that random white noise she finds online, vitamins, and bs supplements are going to help. The white noises are terrible especially since she keeps trying to force it on me every single day for 2 hours, the vitamins are garbage, and the supplements make my anxiety go through the roof.

On top of the depressive and suicidal thoughts, the little things just make me spiral too. I got scammed out of $350 on my birthday a few weeks ago just trying to buy a ps4 to play with my friends. My mother, who is a tiger parent, keeps screaming at me to do my school work knowing full on why I'm struggling in the first place. My siblings aren't helping my case either. They've always hated me and even though I've tried so hard to put in effort for them to like me, I can tell nothing's ever going to change. I feel absolutely useless in comparison to my friends who are getting all their work down while I can't even answer one question on an assignment without having a meltdown on my floor. I can't even look in the mirror without feeling like absolute garbage because of how much I've left myself go this quarantine. And the fact that everything I've managed to type out isn't even a quarter of my problems just makes me feel 10x worse. At this point, I just feel like I'm complaining.

I'm tired of hating myself. I'm tired of having no motivation to the point where I can't even practice my hobbies. I'm tired of feeling stressed and anxious all the time. I'm tired of having anxiety attacks every time I try to go to bed. I'm tired of feeling like a waste of space. I'm tired of my mom denying every possible for of help any ACTUAL medical profession tries to offer me. I'm tired of having responsibilities. I'm tired of waking up. I try so hard to give my future the benefit of the doubt. I imagine what my life could be if I graduated high school, make it into college, have a lover, grow up with a family of my own. But I can't get over my depression no matter how hard I try. I have no hope that I'm going to pass my junior year, and if I stay back I just might end up dropping out. Or killing myself. I'm just so over everything. I can't even enjoy doing nothing. I just wish I could die. I want to die. I don't even try to hide it anymore.

I&amp;#39;ve been struggling for years on top of years on top of years and I just can&amp;#39;t handle anything anymore.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I just recently turned 17, and thought I&amp;#39;d be a senior in high school, but my grades are so terrible I don&amp;#39;t think that&amp;#39;s happening. Since I was young, I&amp;#39;ve always been depressed. My now divorced parents were always fighting, my mom was abusive and to this day doesn&amp;#39;t see it. Whenever you bring up her abusive past, she refuses to even acknowledged it happened. Always &amp;quot;That never happened, stop trying to ruin my name.&amp;quot; and whatnot. Things only got worse for her when I came out. I was bullied relentlessly in elementary through middle school, and could never make any genuine friends.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A few months ago, I planned to kill myself. I was going to jump off a bridge into the freeway. Two days before though, I confided in a friend who was also suicidal, about my plan. They ended up telling the school nurse and I got sent to the hospital and put on suicide watch. That was the first time I ever received treatment of any kind, and on my way to the hospital my mom told my father that I was doing it for attention. From there, I spent a little while in a mental hospital. Right when I was released and had a whole plan on when I was supposed to go back to school, not only did I get run over by my own mom&amp;#39;s car, quarantine started and I ended up trapped at home. Online school has been absolute hell. I can&amp;#39;t keep up, and I have so many missing assignments, it&amp;#39;s not even laughable. I&amp;#39;ve gotten countless emails from teachers and staff asking me to at least try and I did. But I have breakdowns every time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I should&amp;#39;ve been on anti-depressants by now. But because my mom is so against them because of all the bad things she&amp;#39;s read online, she refuses to let me take them. She keeps thinking that random white noise she finds online, vitamins, and bs supplements are going to help. The white noises are terrible especially since she keeps trying to force it on me every single day for 2 hours, the vitamins are garbage, and the supplements make my anxiety go through the roof.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On top of the depressive and suicidal thoughts, the little things just make me spiral too. I got scammed out of $350 on my birthday a few weeks ago just trying to buy a ps4 to play with my friends. My mother, who is a tiger parent, keeps screaming at me to do my school work knowing full on why I&amp;#39;m struggling in the first place. My siblings aren&amp;#39;t helping my case either. They&amp;#39;ve always hated me and even though I&amp;#39;ve tried so hard to put in effort for them to like me, I can tell nothing&amp;#39;s ever going to change. I feel absolutely useless in comparison to my friends who are getting all their work down while I can&amp;#39;t even answer one question on an assignment without having a meltdown on my floor. I can&amp;#39;t even look in the mirror without feeling like absolute garbage because of how much I&amp;#39;ve left myself go this quarantine. And the fact that everything I&amp;#39;ve managed to type out isn&amp;#39;t even a quarter of my problems just makes me feel 10x worse. At this point, I just feel like I&amp;#39;m complaining.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m tired of hating myself. I&amp;#39;m tired of having no motivation to the point where I can&amp;#39;t even practice my hobbies. I&amp;#39;m tired of feeling stressed and anxious all the time. I&amp;#39;m tired of having anxiety attacks every time I try to go to bed. I&amp;#39;m tired of feeling like a waste of space. I&amp;#39;m tired of my mom denying every possible for of help any ACTUAL medical profession tries to offer me. I&amp;#39;m tired of having responsibilities. I&amp;#39;m tired of waking up. I try so hard to give my future the benefit of the doubt. I imagine what my life could be if I graduated high school, make it into college, have a lover, grow up with a family of my own. But I can&amp;#39;t get over my depression no matter how hard I try. I have no hope that I&amp;#39;m going to pass my junior year, and if I stay back I just might end up dropping out. Or killing myself. I&amp;#39;m just so over everything. I can&amp;#39;t even enjoy doing nothing. I just wish I could die. I want to die. I don&amp;#39;t even try to hide it anymore.&lt;/p&gt;
