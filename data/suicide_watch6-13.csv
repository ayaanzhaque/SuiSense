###Summary###

**It's important to respect and understand people's experiences and emotions. It's never necessary, helpful, or kind to support suicidal intent. There are some common misconceptions (discussed below) about suicidal people and how to help them that can cause well-meaning people to inadvertently incite suicide. There are also people online who incite suicide on purpose, often while pretending to be sympathetic and helpful.** 

###Validate Feelings and Experiences, Not Self-Destructive Intentions###

We're here to offer support, not judgement.  That means accepting, with the best understanding we can offer, whatever emotions people express.  Suicidal people are suffering, and we're here to try to ease that by providing support and caring.  The most reliable way we know to de-escalate someone at risk is to give them the experience of feeling understood. That means not judging whether they should be feeling the way they are, or telling them what to do or not do.  

But there's an important line to draw here.  There's a crucial difference between empathizing with feelings and responding non-judgmentally to suicidal thoughts, and in any way endorsing, encouraging, or validating suicidal intentions or hopeless beliefs. 

Anything that condones suicide, even passively, *encourages* suicide. It isn't supportive and does not help. It also violates reddit's sitewide rules as well as our guidelines. Explicitly inciting suicide online is a criminal offense in most jurisdictions. 

Do not treat any OP's post as meaning that will definitely die by suicide and can't change their minds or be helped. Anyone who's able to read the comments here still has a chance to choose whether or not to try to keep living, even if they've also been experiencing intense thoughts of suicide, made a suicide plan, or started carrying it out.  

In [the most useful empirical model we have](https://www.apa.org/science/about/psa/2009/06/sci-brief), the desire to die by suicide primarily comes from two interpersonal factors; alienation and a sense of being a burden or having nothing to offer. These factors usually lead to a profound feeling of being unwelcome in the world. 

**So, any acceptance or reinforcement of suicidal intent, even something ""innocent"" like ""I hope you find peace"", is actually a form of covert shunning that validates a person's sense that they're unwelcome in the world. It will usually add to their pain even if kindly meant and gently worded.**  

###How to Avoid Validating Suicidal Intent###

Keep the following in mind when offering support to anyone at risk for suicide.  

* **People who say they don't want help usually can feel better if they get support that doesn't invalidate their emotions.** Unfortunately, [many popular ""good"" responses are actually counterproductive](https://www.speakingofsuicide.com/2015/03/03/what-not-to-say/). In particular, many friends and family tend to rely exclusively on trying to convince the suicidal person that ""it's not so bad"", and this is usually experienced as ""I don't understand what you're going through and I'm not going to try"".  People who've had ""help"" that made them feel worse don't want any more of the same.  It doesn't mean that someone who actually knows how to be supportive can't give them any comfort.   

*  **Most people who are suicidal want to end their** ***pain,*** **not their lives.**  It's almost never true that death is the only way to end these people's suffering. Of course there are exceptional situations, and we certainly acknowledge that, for some people, the right help can be difficult to find. But preventing someone's suicide doesn't mean prolonging their suffering if we do it by giving them real comfort and understanding. 

* ***An unfixable problem doesn't mean that a good life will never be possible***.  We don't have to fix or change anything to help someone feel better. It's important to keep in mind that the correlation between our outer circumstances and our inner experience is weaker and less direct than commonly assumed.  For every kind of difficult life situation, you will find some people who lapse into suicidal despair, and others who cope amazingly well, and a whole spectrum in between. A key difference is how much inner resilience the person has at the time. This can depend on many personal and situational factors. But when there's not enough, interpersonal support can both compensate for its absence and help rebuild it.  We go into more depth on the ""it gets better"" issue in [this PSA Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/25igd7/whats_wrong_with_it_gets_better_what_if_it_doesnt/) which is always linked from our sidebar (community info on mobile) guidelines. 

* **There are** ***always*** **more choices than brutally forcing someone to stay alive or passively letting them end their lives**.

To avoid accidentally breaking the anti-incitement rule, don't say or try to imply that acting on suicidal thoughts is a good idea, or that someone can't turn back or is already dead.  Do whatever you can to help them feel cared for and welcome, at least in this little corner of the world.  [Our talking tips](http://redd.it/igh87) offer more detailed guidance.

###Look Out for Deliberate Incitement.  It May Come in Disguise.###

Often comments that subtly encourage suicidal intent actually come from suicide fetishists and voyeurs ([unfortunately this is a real and disturbing phenomenon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Francis_Melchert-Dinkel)). People like this *are* out there and the anonymous nature of reddit makes us particularly attractive to them.  

They will typically try to scratch their psychological ""itch"" by saying things that push people closer to the edge.  They often do this by exploiting the myths that we debunked in the bullet points above.  Specifically you might see people doing the following:

* Encouraging the false belief that the only way suicidal people can end their pain is by dying.  **There are** ***always*** **more and better choices than ""brutally forcing someone to stay alive"" or helping (actively or passively) them to end their lives**.

* Creating an artificial and toxic sense of ""solidarity"" by linking their encouragement of suicide to empathy.  They will represent themselves as the only one who really understand the suicidal person, while either directly or indirectly encouraging their self-loathing emotions and self-destructive impulses.  **Since most people in suicidal crisis are in desperate need to empathy and understanding, this is a particularly dangerous form of manipulation.**  

Many suicide inciters are adept at putting a benevolent spin on their activities while actually luring people away from sources of real help.  A couple of key points to keep in mind: 

* **Skilled suicide intervention -- peer or professional -- is based on empathic responsiveness to the person's feelings that reduces their suffering in the moment.**  Contrary to pop-culture myths, it does **not** involve persuasion (""Don't do it!""), cheerleading (""You've got this!"") or meaningless false promises (""Trust me, it gets better!""), or invalidation (""Let me show you how things aren't as bad as you think!"").  Anyone who leads others to expect these kinds of toxic responses, or any other response that prolongs their pain, from expert help may be covertly pro-suicide. (Of course, people sometimes do have bad experience when seeking mental-health treatment, and it's fine to vent about those, but processing our own disappointment and frustration is entirely different from trying to destroy someone else's hope of getting help.)

* **Choices made by competent responders are always informed by the understanding that breaching someone's trust is traumatic and must be avoided if possible.**  Any kind of involuntary intervention is an **extremely unlikely** outcome when someone consults a clinician or calls a hotline. (Confidentiality is addressed in more detail in [our Hotlines FAQ post](http://redd.it/1c7ntr)). The goal is always to provide all help with the client's full knowledge and informed consent. We know that no individual or system is perfect.  Mistakes that lead to bad experiences do sometimes happen to vulnerable people, and we have enormous sympathy for them. But anyone who suggests that this is the norm might be trying to scare people away from the help they need.

,SuicideWatch,"At the suggestion of my therapist, he recommended I join reddit.  So, I'm giving this a try.  I'm 40 years old and suicidal.  I live in New Hampshire, USA.  I have been thinking lately, that, it is my time to leave this world.  I am also addicted to porn and have been viewing it for years.  I've never had a girlfriend, nor have I ever had sex with a woman.  I have only seen one escort in Boston, Massachusetts.  I was excited (too excited) about the prospect of having sex that while the escort and I were lying in bed nude (she was caressing my chest up and down) and she put her hand over my d\*ck, my rocket launched unexpectedly - yes, premature ejaculation.  Sometimes it happens.  Needless to say, we didn't have sex.

I am so depressed and lonely.  I have come to the realization that I'm unattractive to women and that there is no point in living anymore.  I hate my job.  I work in a call center for a major Boston-based insurance company.  It's a terrible job.  I get yelled at by people and I'm completely exhausted every day after talking on the phone with customers.  My job has nothing to do with my college degree.  I majored in marine transportation while attending a maritime academy.  I worked as a junior ship's officer aboard oil tankers for 2 years, but eventually I was fired.  The captain who fired me thought that I was incompetent.

My porn use has escalated.  I look at it almost every morning before I have to sign-on to my work computer to take calls from customers.  I'm working from home right now because of COVID-19.  Also, I don't look at porn on my work computer - I'm not that stupid.  I only look at porn on my personal computer.

In 2017, I asked out a woman at work who was older than me.  She was in her early 40s.  A beautiful blonde who had a very sexy face and a beautiful body.  Anyway, I got rejected and sometimes I think she rejected me because she thought I was ugly.

I'm currently seeing a psychologist and a psychiatrist and the therapy just doesn't seem to work for me.  I feel so hopeless like nothing will ever get better.  I don't think that I will ever find a woman because I am unattractive and skinny.  I was going to the gym to lift weights, but then I stopped.

I did attempt suicide about a year ago.  After my attempt, my family suggested that I go to the hospital.  So, I went to Portsmouth Regional Hospital in New Hampshire into their Behaivoral Health Unit.  I spent 7 days there.  After I got out of the hospital, I felt better but then later on I started looking at porn again and felt depressed and lonely.

I've tried dating sites like [Match.com](https://Match.com) and [OKCupid.com](https://OKCupid.com) and haven't had any success.  I had a subscription for about 1 1/2 years and decided to unsubscribe recently because I just wasn't getting any responses from women.

The only thing that keeps me going are my two nieces who are 8 and 4 years old whom I enjoy playing with like hide-and-go-seek, ride bikes, play catch, play Monopoly and swimming in a pool.  I just love them so much.

Any advice?  I plan on seeing another escort because my goal is to have sex with a woman.  I just don't I have much of a life left in this world.  My uncle committed suicide at 45 years old and I've been strongly considering the same thing.  Maybe sooner if not later when I reach 45.

Your alternatives are either trying (and failing) to play the game of life in a mediocre fashion, running out into the world and spending your 10,000 dollars in retail wages on travel then becoming homeless. But you don't like those options, but you also realize you can't sit around at home forever because that's just being a lazy dickwad, so you just die of helium asphyxiation now, get it over with, and give the 10000 to your siblings for real estate and med school.

I mean if life is meaningless, then there is no morality and therefore nothing wrong with me killing myself. I mean, the only reason we think it's wrong is because we evolved that way. Any species that didn't have an intense desire to live would've died out by now.

,SuicideWatch,"Hi everyone,

I'm 24 y/o female, my brother is a 19 y/o. Mid May, my brother was taken to the hospital for attempting suicide. His online friends called his college to request a wellness check and got the cops involved. They found him unconscious in his dorm room.

We have a very toxic mom. To give you some context, my mom told him ""Do it right the next time so we don't have to drive 8 hours to pick you up."" She loves us but she's very immature, toxic, physically abusive, mentally abusive, etc. She's sort of a horrible human being but in her mind, she has done all she can for us. She had me when she was 19, single mom, we don't talk to our dad.

He's set on doing it again because my brother and I have an extremely close relationship and he doesn't want to be a burden on me. He has been failing school, hates my mom, and feels like if he kills himself, my life will become better because my mom will realize she is the problem. But my mom will never know that. He thinks I'll be sad for a couple of years but I'll get through it because I'm a strong person. He has told my boyfriend that he has bought 100 pills this time for his second attempt.

My brother is the best. But my mom has fucked him up so much. He feels like he doesn't deserve my love and feels extremely guilty that I'll have to take care of him when I went through so much to get where I am. I just graduated with a masters degree and looking for a job on the west coast.

I also want to note there is a genetic component. On my mom's side, my grandpa, my uncle have killed themselves. My mom has attempted suicide when I was in high school by jumping off our apartment but survived. I have been depressed since age 7 but became healthy two years ago. My brother has felt this way since he was 10. I told him once I get a job I can take him away forever and help him get his life back on track but he doesn't want to burden me.

,SuicideWatch,"I was terrified to post on this subreddit.  I kept coming back to here to read other stories.  I kept hoping that someone, somewhere in the world happened to have similar circumstances to mine.  And yet I have to see that. Most people I keep reading about are young.  Most of what I read is from 20 something's feeling lost and alone.  I felt like that in my twenties and was told basically to persevere and that my 30s would be better.  Well I am 30 now.  My life has only gotten worse.  Coronavirus made thins even worse for the whole world. 

I have chronic depression so potent that medication doesn't work.  I have such extreme anxiety that I constantly gaslight myself with every thought. When I feel happy, I am experiencing mania.  I have not felt happiness in almost 15 years. I keep seeing others having relationships of some kind.  I have not dated in almost 13 years.  I have never had sex either.  

When I was 20, I was targeted by the entire fraternity system of my college.  I was labeled a rapist despite the fact that I never have had sex.  I was accused of having a gun and planning to go on a murder spree.  I have never owned a gun in my life and I don't feel safe having one.  The police couldn't ignore even false accusations for you see, I went to one of the colleges that had a media breaking school shooting in the United States.  Said shooter had Autism. I do too. It was all too easy to turn the police against me.

So I fled.  I fled halfway across the united states on my own hoping I could rebuild.  But 10 years later, I have been homeless twice, my body is physically falling apart, and my mental state is far worse.  

I tried getting disability.  I was denied.  I tried unemployment.  I was denied and got a letter stating that the government thought someone was commiting fraud using my name. I got a more recent psychology evaluation where the doctors deemed I had histrionic personality disorder and made things up for attention. Now I second guess the second guessing.  I constantly wonder if my memories are all fake and I am making things up out of desperation for attention.

Currently one fo my friends let me move in with him.  When Corona struck, I lost my job.  And the one I got next cut my hours so low that I make $30.00 a week. I owe my roommate 850.00 and will owe him another 600 in two weeks. Many friends have tried to bail me out financially in the past.  I have been unable to pay any of them back.  I feel like a parasite who keeps taking from others but is unable to give back.

I should point out that despite all this insanity, I managed to get a bachelor's degree in technical writing.  A field that I know for a fact is resecsion proof.  Yet even though I have 10 published books, 4 of them where I am the sole author I can't find work.  Despite helping a business move to the United States and spearheaded their marketing in english I can't prove that I am a valued worker.

I owe the united states government $32,000.00.  my university will not let me have my transcripts.  I have been denied from many jobs because I can't prove that I have a degree that I was forced by my parents against my will to take out a loan for.

I could keep talking about all the horrible things in my life that have convinced me that God is a sadistic and cruel demon that delights in screaming.  Please don't try and lecture me with the jesus crap.  I was born Jewish and have been assaulted and attacked by so many Christians that I have a subconscious hatred for the entire faith.

I have played enough video games to know that I exist in an unwinable world state.   Because I am unable to utilize narcissism and corruption to get ahead I continue to despair every day that I make the insane decision to continue living.  My game is over.  I just refuse to turn it off.  It's pure madness that I have not ended my life already.  I am at wits end.  I don't know how I could possibly find any light at the end of any tunnel.  I'm falling in a lot filled with spikes and only through sheer luck have I not been impaled.  Well luck might be the wrong word.  Let's call it cruelty shall we?

And please don't lecture me on white privilege either.  I'm jewish and autistic.  I'm only white until the in groups need a scapegoat.  I am hated simply for being born.  An action.

,SuicideWatch,"Just a quick history, I have been feeling depressed for more than 5 years, but I've only been diagnosed 3 years ago. 

I have multiple issues that I cannot bring up with my psychiatrist and my family.

1st is that my family says that they want me to talk about what I feel more, but they don't want to listen. I have always been and emotional person and I cry easily especially when frustrated. My father doesn't like it when I cry, same with my mother. I feel so fucking lost and hopeless because I don't know who to talk to and I just need someone to listen to me and let me cry it all.

I value my family. I love them so much, I really do. Before, the reason why I cannot off myself is because of them. I didn't want them to feel sad and guilty over something that they cannot handle. I also have 3 dogs of my own. I love them so much. Nowadays, I feel like they are now solely the reason why I try to wake up in the morning and put on a happy facade for everyone to see. 

That leads to my 2nd issue, one of my dogs had bitten my brother's gf when she got to close to something that he is quite protective of. That made my brotger angry and now he'a been telling me that he'll get rid of my dog (either by poisoning him or taking him somewhere far and basically abandoning him). I have been feeling angry and irritated with that brother of mine. He always wants me to follow his plans. Even my full recovery, he wants to control my every move and dictate my life. He is trying to guilt me to fucking abandoning my dog (which I will never do). I am starting to hate him more as he is one of the reason why I am feeling the urge to harm myself again. Just hearing his voice makes me feel irritated and I dread the moment where I have to spend the day with him at home. 

3rd and probably the worst of all. I am forced to keep my father's affair a secret. He doesn't know that I am aware of it. I don't want my mother to get hurt. I don't want to have a broken family. I don't know if I should confront my father about this.

My family hates me. Didn’t reach out to support me after my failed attempt, and thinks I’m a failure for not finishing school.

&lt;p&gt;I tried to start my own online business, but I doubt it’ll be successful. I don’t even know if I should keep bothering with it. I don’t want to go all the way with OF because I don’t want to screw up my life even more, but I could use the money. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I saved up a little nest egg of $10K from SW, but I’m just unhappy. Tried to get into investing, but I know that’s not a job. I could get into escorting, but there’s no proof of income with that and I would love to just date a normal guy who has a steady life and could help me get my life together. I want to be a normal 23 year old. Every time I try to visit with my family, they remind me of how much I’ve fucked up my life. I just wish I had a hug or someone to love me and take me in while I try different things to try to be happy or create a purpose for myself, but I know that will never happen. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m ready to end it. I can’t do it anymore. I don’t want to end up bakeracted again or vomiting all day again. I’ve tried so many times. I’m old now and my life isn’t getting any better. I have no one. I have nothing. Therapy doesn’t help anymore, and antidepressants make me numb. My family would be so happy to get that call that I’m out of their lives. I just need help for a way to do it. I just want to fall asleep and not wake up. I’ll need to drive out to the middle of nowhere because I don’t want me roommates finding me. I’ll need to let someone take care of my dog for a bit or something while I do it. I truly keep driving my life farther down the shitter. I don’t want to do it anymore. Help.&lt;/p&gt;

,SuicideWatch,"It's been two months since I've gotten clean from meth, crack, xanax, heroin, and molly. I ruined my life, wrecked my car, lost my job, fucked up my relationship with my significant other for a lengthy interim. Ended up losing all of my friends in the time of the usage. Now that I'm clean, I'm struggling to find a job. I've got court coming in like two weeks, which determines whether I go to jail or prison, and how long (hopefully not at all..) my license is suspended. I ended up hitting a car or 4, one of the two, which lead to me getting charged with a couple things while I was out of my mind.

Idk what to do. I’m super close to my sister and never picked anything up, I’ve caught my friend multiple times so I guess I thought I’d catch someone like my sister if they were on the edge as well. I can’t comprehend that she tried to do that, we live in a pretty happy and stable house and my parents do whatever they can to keep up happy. Idk how to approach her, she doesn’t (and can’t) know that I know that she did this and I just don’t know how to help.

 I can’t grasp the fact that she tried to take her life, I keep thinking she did it to draw attention away from what she did earlier that day, especially since she tried to use a painkiller instead of the harder drugs we have on the house for my mom or grandparents. But then I go back to maybe she just didn’t know, and if that’s the case I’m glad she didn’t because she wouldn’t be alive if she did. 

The hospital reported the incident and she’s going to be on suicide watch soon, idk how that’s going to settle with her and I’m scared she’ll try it again thinking  it’ll make it easier for us. If the court makes a decision within the next 6 months my parents are going to have to choose either her or myself to go to child protective services since we’re both minors ( I’m 18 in 6 months that why I mentioned 6 months earlier) and if they take her it could make things worse for her mentally as well. 

Idk what to do, I can’t grasp that she tried to end her life, idk how to help her or my mom or anyone in this situation.

i have been sitting on this fucking bridge for 2 hours now, and my mind keeps making up excuses why i shouldnt jump off it.. what if i dont die on impact, what if someone rescues me, what if i just get into a coma for years.. i live in a 10 floor building. went up to the roof tonight, looked down, but i cant jump off it because thats where i live, that would be fucked up. the wind was blowing pretty hard tonight, so i figured i'll just stand on the edge and wait until it pushes me down. i smoked 7 cigs just standing still, and there was absolutely no fucking wind at all.

its not that i hate everything. i love a lot of things in this world, and unfortunately this keeps me from killing myself too. but at the same time, i know the bullshit in my head will just get bullshittier every day, so why not end it sooner?

,SuicideWatch,"I live a life without ambition. No dreams, no goals in life, nothing. Everything feel empty. While everyone is motiveted to become a docter, to become a engineer, I wished to become a cloud, floating around without purpose. I have to lie to people about my future career, my biggest dream in life. I don't want their judgemental looks when I answer them honestly. I don't want cast doubt upon the ""normal"" me that I put up on everyday so nobody would look at me like some sick freak.

Dream and ambition motived people to better themselves, to become more knowledgeable, to become stronger and yet I never felt anything like that. I know that I should study harder, I know that I should go outside and get to know people better, I know I shouldn't live a life like this. And yet I thought myself that: ""It wouldn't matter anyway"". No one would encourage me to go on, no one would ever pat me on the back and say ""Good job, keep up the effort"" genuinely. I stop caring. Everying goes downhill from there, just like I expected. Just like when I tried better myself.

No dreams, no goals in life, nothing. Everything feel empty. While everyone is motiveted to become a docter, to become a engineer, I wished to become a cloud, floating around without purpose. I have to lie to people about my future career, my biggest dream in life. I don&amp;#39;t want their judgemental looks when I answer them honestly. I don&amp;#39;t want cast doubt upon the &amp;quot;normal&amp;quot; me that I put up on everyday so nobody would look at me like some sick freak.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dream and ambition motived people to better themselves, to become more knowledgeable, to become stronger and yet I never felt anything like that. I know that I should study harder, I know that I should go outside and get to know people better, I know I shouldn&amp;#39;t live a life like this. And yet I thought myself that: &amp;quot;It wouldn&amp;#39;t matter anyway&amp;quot;. No one would encourage me to go on, no one would ever pat me on the back and say &amp;quot;Good job, keep up the effort&amp;quot; genuinely. I stop caring.

,SuicideWatch,"Thank you for reading this. I’m a woman in her 20’s in Australia. I’m not sure what I want to achieve through this post, but I do know it will be a ramble. 

I’ve been speaking to a therapist about childhood traumas that have left me with the core belief that I am unlovable. Putting a name to it and recognising it has made things very raw for me, I think. 

The last few days I’ve been feeling a deep sense of despair. I’ve been a bit afraid of being alone in my apartment in case I hurt myself. I’ve been craving an intensity of experience, maybe cutting myself, or holding my breath until I pass out. I want to drive out to a field and scream and scream and scream. I feel like a pressure cooker with no release. 

I am not ready to die. Do you want to know my main reason? My beloved cat is asleep on top of me right now and I can’t stand the thought of him not understanding where I went, or being sent to a shelter. 

If I did it, my family and friends would be surprised and confused. They’d wonder why I never reached out for help. I don’t know how to explain the help I need, not even to my therapist. I just hate myself, hate my body. I feel sociopathic. I feel I’m not a good person and the people in my life haven’t realised yet. 

I’m scared of telling anyone I’ve been thinking about suicide in case they’re obligated to intervene. I don’t want to be institutionalised. I don’t want people to think I’m attention seeking or that they have to walk on eggshells around me.

My name is Jessica and I'm 22 years old. I've been struggling with depression and suicidal thoughts since I was 5 years old. My last suicide attempt was April 3rd and I overdosed on quietiapine. I've been taking Zoloft and seeing a therapist every week, but I still feel the walls closing in on me. I've had this on and off relationship with my boyfriend, last night he broke it off again. I only have one friend, but she moved to another state back in October. My family doesn't really reach out to me unless they need their hair done or hair advice. I work 2 jobs; I'm a full time receptionist at a car dealership and I'm a hairdresser in the evenings and on Saturdays. Most work days are 12 hour days, which I loved because it was great distraction for my depression. But the thing is, I feel so alone. I'm a big introvert and I hate meeting new people. My boyfriend was the only person I'd really see and talk to. But that relationship went from dream come true to wishing it never happened. I don't see or really talk to my one best friend. I've been contemplating suicide again just a few weeks after my last attempt. I just feel so lost and helpless. I'm drowning. I honestly feel like I will never be truly happy and I'm just so tired of chasing something I know I'll never catch. I really don't want to hear the whole ""you're so young, you have your whole life ahead of you"" stuff. It's hard to feel that way when even last week feels like it was a year ago. I try my best to be a good person and put so much love out to the world, but it never really seems to come back to me. Almost every day I'm wishing I died April 3rd. I do have a full bottle of sleeping medication I'm thinking about taking. I just can't stand this empty hole in my heart. I'm so tired of crying myself to sleep and feeling like I'll never be enough for anyone. I just wish I could go to sleep and dream of the wonderful memories with my loved ones and never wake up.

I got a job, she’s been in, and out of jobs just out of not being able to do it, which I get.

Fast forward she has a job she likes, I deliver food, I crash my car into a drain pipe, nothing too bad, new tire. Out of work for a day.

Two weeks later back tire pops, out of work for a few days, buy a brand new set of tires, replace rotors and brake pads cause they were grinding, and got it inspected, and the oil changed.

She’s gets a job she likes, works mostly around my schedule cause she doesn’t have a car, so I take her to and from work when I can. 

We’ve been behind on rent since the shutdowns, we used our stimulus checks to pay rent. Now we’re 2 months behind because our tiny one bedroom apartment is $1100 a month.

We both get into a car crash, she doesn’t have health insurance, car insurance only pays for $2k of medical bills. Her hand is broken, I have whiplash, car is total loss.

Mom buys a car for me, without me even asking for $900. Car is a total lemon, she puts $700 into it to get it to pass inspection, actually function, etc. Shes making me pay her back.

Car accident wasn’t my fault, the check is for $1600, but is a complete downgrade with more miles than my car that is from the 90s as this new lemon car is from the 2000s

I’ve been out of work for 5 days, go back to work today, drivers side door, one do the the things we fixed, literally breaks after me getting in and out twice.
The entire engine locks up and dies three times during my shift, I have to coast into whatever acceleration I have put my hazards on and pull over, turn the car off and back on, later in the night I noticed the windshield looks like someone took steel wool to it, I wear glasses so it’s hard to see through the glare at night anyways, but at night now with all the lines, I can’t even see the roads.

So now I’m stuck with a lemon car, I’m going to be pumping all my money into just being able to fix, medical bills for me and my girlfriend, rent, and like I just can’t anymore, the stress of all of this is just too much.

,SuicideWatch,"I've dealt with suicidal thoughts since I was 8 years old and I've attempted a handful of times but I really think I just need to get it over with this time. I don't want to resort to it deep down. I'm incredibly lucky to have a lot of great friends but their emotional support doesn't help me push through anymore. I don't want to put that hurt on them.

I'm 23 and have never really been able to hold a job long due to a combination of shit in my life; both mental and physical illness. About a decade ago, I had spine surgery and it went wrong. A few years later I developed rheumatoid arthritis so that leaves me unable to really do anything that requires a lot of physical activity. Standing is one thing I cannot do for long at all. I've always been depressed as my childhood was shit. (God this is going to be all over the place lmao I'm really a mess right now so sorry.) I'm also on the autism spectrum, have social anxiety, and ptsd. The reason I was diagnosed with PTSD was because the most important person in my life was murdered by an incel a few years ago. It's a daily fucking struggle to wake up to a world without her. She was the first person that really gave me a reason to want to save myself. The friends I mentioned earlier are all people that I know through/because of her. Everything good in my life was because of her. I won't really go into much how it affects me but it's hard for me to interact with people with that combination of mental problems. I know I need professional help but I really can't afford it. I haven't been able to see a therapist in over 2 years. I'm not sure if there are options for me. There's also a handful of other mental illnesses I've been diagnosed with that don't exactly help it but I feel like they aren't majorly affecting all of this.

I moved across the country about two years ago with my ex; I worked overnights at a group home for youths. I liked it for the most part but I never got any better at the social interaction. Also overnights were draining and I felt like sleep and work consumed my life. My ex pretended to be excited about it all when really they weren't ready to live with someone else and was too scared to just be honest. So I was blindsided and kicked out of our apartment after a bit and ended up in Philadelphia which I hoped I could find a job in. I've been here since September and still no luck. The pandemic makes it harder, of course. I've been living on the little I can make from art commissions since, but honestly I no longer have the energy and desire to do art. I'm just so tired of being alive. It's awful feeling like my passion is being wiped out. Art is what I love. I've had passive suicidal thoughts on good days in my life so I don't expect it to go away entirely. It would be nice but I'm just wanting a tolerable existence.

It's so hard to sum all of this up in a post that isn't a novel. I've done so much research over the past 10 months or whatever and this is the first time I'm trying to reach out about this. My friends have zero idea how to help this situation and it's to the point where their support is low key starting to annoy me because it doesn't make anything easier. I feel bad because I'm so lucky to have them but I just don't care anymore. It's embarrassing as fuck and I don't want to put that burden on them anyway even though I know they don't see me as a burden.

I'm not sure if there's a better place to discuss this where I can actually get advice from people so if you know of any please let me know because I'm desperate.

Not just for you, but for the people you know, for me, and if you don’t know people, get to know me; I could use it too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Please.&lt;/p&gt;

,SuicideWatch,"Im thinking of suicide but Im scared life might maybe get better for us or maybe I might go to hell or maybe its painful. Im from middle east and im very religious I dont want to die but I dont want to live like this.

Also im 15 and I dropped out last year after failing once I dropped out after 2 months of the year becoz Im embarrassed and i failed becoz my dad retired and we moved from our old big house to a new small apartment. I live with 4 younger sisters in one room my dad sleep in the living room we have a small kitchen. I used to live in a big house with two floors but my dad lied to me but I knew after coz he said the rent was too high also my mom is not with us shes in lebanaan with her family my dad used to hit her and she made problems with the police so she had to go I am the only one that remembers her and miss her sometimes out of all my sisters they are too small and too young to miss her. I will throw the account away after coz Im scared someone will know me.

Anyways i used to be embarrassed to come out of the apartment becoz I was scared someone from school will see me also the bus doesnt come to our building so my dad drives me to school his car is really old and embarrassing I go really early and wait for the cleaners to open up the school door my dad always used to ask me why I always go so early and I lied to him I dont want him to know so he wont be embarrassed also this is before i drop out.

And i was rich back in the past now i cant even get a new phone and also im the only one with phone all my sisters didnt ask for phone when my dad had money so their too late and always use my phone to play games I hate it but if I dont they scream 🙂 I only dropped out becoz the stress was too much I was always scared someone will know where i live when we moved they asked for our house number and I always wait and don’t give them if they know the number they will know our address and Im scared they will tell their daughters this girl lives in apartment

Also my school all rich girls with drivers and maid. im only in that school becoz of im their nationality we have free water and lights becoz the nationality gives it to us. Im really scared and im still scared they will find out were now poor and sometimes i still have dreams and nightmares that they come and knock and laugh at us. 

And i think my dad is happy Im not in school now he doesnt have to drive me to school since he retired he always sleeps he only wakes up to make food and then he sleeps. maybe becoz hes old now hes too tired and the oil is too expensive and also school stuff.

Anyways i had one girl fatma she was my best friend one time I went to her house and i didnt know i wasnt allowed if i dont call her first also we always talk on the home phone everyday but then when I visited her she told me to go home her dad was mad so when I went home the next day in school she tells me her dad doesnt want her to talk to me so she doesnt and i see her with new friends after from her new class becoz school started and we all changed classes i didnt i failed and I think shes embarrassed of me becoz I failed not becoz of her dad.

Also i used to have 3 best friends we were all one group but then they all go away execept one of them whos the girl i told u about her name is fatma i dont care if anyone know her becoz i hate her now. 💔

Anyways all my sisters dont go to school only me they went to kg but then no school becoz no bus will come to us were too far away we live in a old street.

I really dont want to die but allthe girls they live better than us and only me and my sisters live poor were so poor like their maids. I really wish we had money i think life will be so better. i wish i know we were going to be poor maybe i would have stopped asking for things and finally I wish I had a job so I can get my dad a new car and get my sisters ipads.

Finally i want to die but im scared allah will take me to hell im scared of the pain and fire also im really religious i pray everyday five times and i dont curse anymore i always used to fight now i dont and im really good and i didnt eat ramadan this year all month but my sisters did i think they will go to hell i hope not they are too young.

Also the building is only two floors so i cant jump i dont know how i will die if i want to die.

People don’t just ignore it when you get worse and refuse to do anything about it.
They get the same bitterness in them, or they leave before it gets that bad. Sometimes forced into the second option, when empathy dissolved. When you keep pushing them to leave, as if daring them to the end of their patience.

Just let it out. Don’t hold back. We hold back by saying to ourselves, “no one really cares” “my problems are dumb” “it’s trivial” “I’ll get it over it” “venting doesn’t work” etc. 
But honestly, the point is just to let it out. It’s a form easing pressure and relief. Even for a little bit. And the more you share, the more personal you get, and the more your express details and acknowledge your desires, the more you’re letting out negativity. 
But don’t even rationalize it. Just talk. Let us know what’s on your mind. 
I love each and everyone of you all. I just do. Life’s a bitch but if there’s anything I realized, its that good people who care about you and support you and love you and nourish you are pillars to good mental health and strength to endure hardship in this life. 
We truly only live for other people. What if you were the only person alive? Of course life wouldn’t be worth living! There’s nothing to live for! So when you’re deprived of connection and love (either through self or circumstance), suicide becomes a viable solution. 
I know it can be lonely and I know that many of you don’t feel like you have single person who loves you or someone or something your can love. 
But if it’s worth anything. I’m here for you. With all my heart I care about you.

My parents already hate me, which is good. Parents are drug addicts and always ask me for money, stealing it most times or beating me up for it.  I'm 20 years old, the oldest brother. I am the only one working in our home, I worked two jobs to support my family.

Money is how I control my sisters. If they do chores, attend school, get good marks, and listen to me, I put between $5 - $20 under their pillows every Sunday night. I usually give my oldest extra for groceries and laundry literally does everything for fam. But last week I ran out of money. I lost both my jobs due to COVID19. I thought I'd have enough to pay my siblings for last Sunday, but my parents stole it. The remainder of my money! I have nothing.

I thought I'd end it all last Saturday night with ego and pride. But like an idiot, I waited for my 16 year old sister to head to sleep before leaving my home alone and ending everything discreetly. I could have just walked out in front of her, WHY. But NOPE she didn't sleep and continued to watch tv episode after episode. I ended up falling asleep on my sofa-bed. I felt her pull my feet up, lay me on my side, and put my blanket around me. She even kissed me on the cheek. And before I could even get up, I fell asleep.

DID SHE KNOW MY PLAN????!!! Why would she kiss me, I don't show any affection. WTF. WHY DID SHE WATCH TV MAKING ME STOP MY PLANS. WHY WHY. DID SHE DRUG ME? DID SHE KNOW DID SHE KNOW dbdbsbfdbs

On Sunday night, I didn't give my siblings money. I had none to give of course. I expected hate, demands why was there no money. BUT NOPE. They didn't say anything. WHY. HATE ME. I FAILED YOU. I HAVE NOTHING I AM WORTHLESS. WHY STAY QUIET. Spit on me demand money punch me kick me hurt me.

I realized that now,  I want to be hated before leaving this world. I don't want any love from my family, just hate. I don't want any care for me, no looking for me, no sadness or emotions to me. I decided to write a hateful message to all my family. Im hoping they read this and spit on my grave.

Now I wait until my family leaves the living room. When they all leave, I am driving off into the sunset, at peace for what I accomplished and hopefully never remembered again. I'm happy to say I will donate my organs.

Counselling or suicide hotlines have never helped, because for me, they don't necessarily solve my problems, it just ""helps"" you to ""deal"" with them. There's no dealing with my problems.

I am not even sure if this is the right place. I don’t have an active plan or anything. I don’t know what to expect. Maybe advice? 

I beat cancer. Well, I didn’t beat it. I didn’t do anything. I had a surgery and it was gone suddenly but they tell me I beat it. They tell me I should be happy. They give me all these pink things and hugs and praise and it doesn’t make any sense. 

I am glad to be alive. Well, I am glad I didn’t die from cancer. That felt like an avalanche when I got the news. 

My whole life I have sort of just let life happen to me and not thought much about it , not really caring much if I got up tomorrow. I went through the motions. I wasn’t paralyzed. It was like a task ticker. You do tasks and you get sleep or sex or hugs and food and something that distracts you or brings you little joys. I was super productive all the time. Then the phone rang and I got the news and I wanted to live suddenly. I felt every moment. 

Now I am suppose to feel this renewed sense of life? But it isn’t there. 

I know it is partially the Tamoxifen. I hate taking it. The headaches and mood swings are awful. They are trying different medicine to help with things but they keep telling me how important the Tamoxifen is. So I can live. Live. Be alive. It feels so disconnected. 

I have a wonderful therapist and oncologist but I hold back talking to them because I want to be a good patient. I want to be grateful to them for keeping me alive. I try not to cry as the oncologist tells me everything looks great as she pushes against my scar. It doesn’t feel great and then I walk out into the waiting room of sicker people. People still fighting. People who may die. 

The thought of cancer killing me scares me. I can’t think of it without panicking. 

But I find myself walking a little too close to ledges, wishing for people hurting me physically, taking risks I shouldn’t.

I find myself hoping that tomorrow I just don’t wake up. But don’t let it be from cancer. Anything else. Everything else.

I find myself wondering what would happen if I drove myself into a tree like my mother. I hated her for doing that. I thought it selfish and now here I am.

I look in the mirror at this scar where a breast should be and I know I should be thankful I got to keep one but I am not. It looks hideous. I am hideous. It is so trivial. Right? A breast. Who cares? I do, apparently. And when someone touches it? Ugh. It makes me want to rip things apart. 

A coworker of mine got diagnosed with a cancer after me. She was two stages more advanced than me but it was still operable. She had a good chance. She died last week. I am having problems processing that. 

Life use to make sense. You did a task. You got a reward. The rewards just don’t seem to matter anymore. 

There are just tasks and I am not sure why I am even doing them anymore. 

I have a good therapist. I take the medicines. I do the tasks. I feel relieved about the cancer not killing me. I do the writing about it. I just don’t understand why I don’t feel any better. 

I have the friends and family and they are so supportive but every single time I mention I am sad they remind me how strong I am and how I beat cancer. I don’t feel strong. I feel lost and fragile and gross.

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m not sure where I&amp;#39;ll go this time. Somewhere where I might finally have the balls to end it all. Maybe Montana. I heard it&amp;#39;s pretty there. And I always wanted to see something pretty before I die.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And, like, part of me is broken  and part of me is just accepting of this. Like, I&amp;#39;ve come to terms with this being my life. And I&amp;#39;d like to have a place to settle down and have people who care about me for me and be there for me without having ulterior motives, but I don&amp;#39;t think that I&amp;#39;ll ever have that. And I beat myself up over it because I feel like I should know that this is my fate by now and I--stupidly--try to change it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, yea. The movie is coming to an end and I can see the credits and I&amp;#39;m not part of the main cast. Not even a supporting actor. Not even named. Just &amp;quot;Guy who brought coffee.&amp;quot; And I hate coffee.&lt;/p&gt;

,SuicideWatch,"I've been dealing with depression since I was about 11, though I've never been officially diagnosed. But my mother often brings up the fact that I was a happy kid and then it seemed like something snapped and I haven't been the same. I agree.

I spent a lot of middle and high school very sad and angry, but I never showed it. On the outside life was good. I had friends, was active in a lot of clubs and sports, even was putting myself out there by being on the announcements which was filmed and broadcast to the school every morning. But at night, when I was alone, I constantly thought of ending it. A couple times I walked down to the medicine cabinet in the middle of the night and spent over an hour just staring at the bottle. But I always put them back and didn't try.

Then college hit. I got into a good school and I thought this was finally my chance to make myself happy. But I wasn't. I didn't make any friends. Even my roommate didn't talk to me. The friends from high school I did have slowly faded away. I went to all my classes but didn't do the work. I failed my first year. Didn't go back.

I moved back home and went to a local college. Five years later I finally finished with a meaningless degree in film. I love the subject, but my anxiety has peaked and I can't put myself out there to actually work in the industry. I tried going to a trade school to at least have a career, but ended up not finishing that degree.

Now here I am. 26, overweight, never been in a relationship. No career outlooks. I'm in a customer service job that I hate. People just yell at me all day. I can't do anything right. I have people constantly calling in to complain about me to coworkers because I tell them the wrong information. Not on purpose. I was thrown in with little training. But it's taking a toll. I go to work, mess up all day, come home, cry myself to sleep and then wake up so I can do it again. I can't cope with the reality that my life is nothing. Meaningless. I had everything lined up to go right and I just fucked it all up for myself. 

I stopped by Target after work today to get things for lunch for the rest of the week. While there I picked up a rope. There's this small wooded area out by the lake. That last summer before college my friends and I all sat there listening to the waves. It was the last time I remember being at least somewhat happy and hopeful about my future.

,SuicideWatch,"I work near a lake with a boardwalk. there's a bridge (about 20 feet above the water) that you have to climb up and cross to get to the other side of the boardwalk.

I climbed it on my lunch break today. I can't swim, so if I jumped into the lake during a slow time, I would almost certainly drown before anyone could get to me (assuming anyone spots me).

  Fortunately I got into a good high school after writing the entrance exam but all was not well. I was constantly bullied especially for how I behaved and the fact that I was dumb. The teachers did not make it any better and they made me feel like I was not worth it even if I had a good behavior. After 4 years of constant bullying and feeling worthless, I still had hope that I could make it. Fortunately I transferred schools after grade ten to Canada, when I started it, it was difficult adapting but I still got an average of an A and even got an ward so much to my excitement.
   I got admission into two universities in Canada and I felt amazing. My father told me that the tuition was too much and we were four children so I went back to study in Africa but a different country(different from where I had school before Canada). I got a late admission so it was difficult to catch up, I did not have any friends too to assist me  so I buried my depression in Kdrama cause it made me imagine the life I wanted but could not have. After my exams for the first sem in my first year I got Cs,Ds and Es. I fell into depression because getting an E was a resit and my parents r really strict. 
 The next sem I tried to do better and I got more Cs but then I got an F.

,SuicideWatch,"My GF is having a rough go of it. Shes had chronic pelvic pain for ~3 years following a rape and follow-on promiscuity in attempts to cope. Around February this year the pain kicked into overdrive due to a reaction from a medicine. She has been dealing with urinary frequency and retention at times along with general horrific muscular pain. Weve gone to a million doctors and have finally found a support team full of some top notch individuals. (She has Pelvic Floor Dysfunction and PFD induced interstitial cystitis along with extreme sensitivities to side effects from medication) Her primary care dr, OBGYN, Physical Therapist, accupuncturist, Phycotherapist, and Hypnotherapist have really ushered some progression in since April which is great. 

Sadly, the pain is still around, albiet, less than in Feb but its still not great. Recently, due to an increase in pain and sleeplessness, shes having 2 to 3 panic attacks each day and starting to really concern me about suicide again as weve started talking about that daily during the panic attacks. All the Drs. and therapists are aware of all the details and are working with her on it. We just started her on an SSRI that shouldnt cause any urinary retention but we have to wait for it to kick in.. and if she has any urinary symptoms during this time, i fear it may be falsely correlated with the SSRI. Which then she would want to stop taking...

In all honesty this whole situation scares me because am always concerned about her well being when im sleeping or at work. I feel like i spend almost all of my time in the day trying to keep her alive. Im fighting a battle of my own trying not to lose hope and trying to find ways to keep her mental in a good state through her pain. I really just dont know where to go from here. She wants immediate relief, which i cant blame her for, but I dont know how to provide it. Or even find someone who could at this point. Im scared that she may actually attempt suicide, and im at the point where i want to start hiding things from her (some drugs that she doesnt need that she can OD on are already hidden). I know that isnt the right answer, even hiding the drugs. Im just at a loss now. And i dont know how many more times I can take her on walks and calm her down. That tactic has been working but its not a long term solution. None of this is. I just dont know what to do next to keep her alive.

,SuicideWatch,"I’ve been getting closer to accepting death, fear of it and nonexistence is the only thing keeping me from committing suicide now. I was born with an immune system that’s practically nonexistent. I was recently potentially exposed to corona. Tonight I felt like I hit a wall and I feel like shit. Feverish, headache, exhausted, sore like I pulled a muscle, congested, dry coughing, shortness of breath, tickle in my throat. I’m sure I’ll wake up tomorrow sick beyond belief.

I don’t intend to tell anyone if I do. I don’t intend to do anything. I won’t get help, I won’t take medicine, I won’t eat, I won’t get out of bed. I won’t fight it. I’ll just let it take me. Because I’m too much of a pussy to kill myself directly. In case I’m too weak to later, I wrote a last letter tonight. I guess it’s not really a “suicide letter” but it serves the same function. My feelings, my gratitude for death, my wishes for my body.

I’m writing here because I can’t tell anyone else what’s going through my mind, or I’m sure they’d insist on the hospital. I don’t want to go through it. It’s less painful for my family if they find out I passed, instead of watching it happen, and all I ever do is cause pain.

I’ll spare you the details of why my life was doomed from the start — 5 mental illness diagnosis, an immune system disease, more physical problems. Anytime I share the story online, I just get horror and sympathy. I don’t care about that, I just want someone who can relate to how I feel.

The first time I tried to kill myself, I was 7 years old. I didn’t even know what suicide was. My parents were strict back then, before they eased up because they realized I was in for a shitty life. I wasn’t allowed to watch TV, or see movies. God forbid I so much as look at a computer. I went to a private school. I didn’t know anything. I don’t even think I really understood death, I just knew that I couldn’t take the pain anymore. I tried to slice open my throat. Didn’t get very far, turns out it takes a lot of strength to make any real damage with a kitchen knife. My parents caught me really quickly.

Since then my life has been shit. I’m a terrible daughter, I was a terrible friend to the few that I had — they all ditched me eventually. I haven’t had a friend in 3 years now, and I’m almost 21. Never had a boyfriend either, or a real date, or even a first kiss. I have subpar grades. I’ve dropped out of college twice now.

Maybe I could deal, but I have a younger sister, only a year apart. She’s gorgeous, model body, way smarter and harder working than I’ll ever be. Perfect mental health, perfect physical health. Everyone loves her, my parents dote on her and have made it obvious since we were young that she’s their favorite. In high school, people in my grade who acted like I didn’t exist approached me for the first time to ask about her, say how pretty she was. “It must be hard having a cheerleader sister who looks like that.” Thanks. She’s a genuinely nice person, too — easy to get along with, doesn’t have a mean bone in her body. Bets any guy she wants. Even the few guys who have shown interest in me suddenly ignore me to ask about her if they so much see her tagged in my socials. It’s fucking awful.

I just can’t put up with this anymore. I was born broken. I’m a failure. All the suffering didn’t give me perspective, it just made me a bitter, bad person. I’m going nowhere in life.

I'm ''currently'' studying in college but have been tormented by people that slowly has been pushing their work onto me, eventually it became too much as it was severly affecting my studies.

I had the mindset  everyday of rather killing myself than giving them a freeride. Had took a break from school since i've slowly started to hate the whole education and my life. Trying to change environment i thought would've been a solution but i still feel like i just want to end it all, instead of going back to face the same situation.

Some days it can be decent, but other days i feel good for 5 minutes and the next minute i just want to drive my car 150mph into a wall without seatbelt.

I just wanted to ventilate as i have noone else to talk to and my parents really don't understand. My dad just tease me for having bad work-ethic and my brothers just think suicide thoughts is a joke...

Nothing is more distressing being in my early 20's thinking about my most likely cause of death. I don't care about suddenly dying (car impact, gunshot, etc.). There is nothing worse than knowing that i have a slow killer in my lungs. Every morning once I wake up my brain starts to go full on 1000% thinking about my suspected future lung disease.

It's just constant hurdles to jump through, constant suffering, constant existence, when a lot of the time I wish that my existence be taken away in exchange for being eternally neutral... Devoid of any emotion, rather than living in a world that I am destined to suffer.

Obviously there are mini pockets of joy that happen every once and a while, but I'd just consider this human pleasure more than genuine enjoyment of life itself.

I barely can get myself out of bed yet I am plagued with many sleepless nights thinking about how much of a loser I am. 

And its disheartening, because when I look at my younger self, I think about what could've been and I crumble inside. Instead of the bright young gentleman I was, I am now just an irredeemable, unintelligent stoner who is on the brink of failing for the year.

,SuicideWatch,"Honestly I don't know if I've ever been this low in my life before. My mental health is deteriorating fast and physically I'm not doing very well either. I really don't know why I'm posting on here, no one can change my life but me...but I suppose I just want to feel heard and not alone? This year started out amazing for me, everything was going so perfectly. I think that's part of why I am struggling so badly, because the higher and happier you get in life, the lower and harder you fall. Anyways, I'm going to share a \*few\* of the problems in my life and how I've reached what feels like rock bottom...

I have gambled (addictively) in the stock market since I was 16; I lost a lot of money in high school (all of my savings from my first job) and never really forgave myself for that. I promised I would make it back one day and after taking a break from trading I started again last year...after practicing a couple trading strategies and losing a small amount last summer, I decided to invest (long term) a substantial amount in December of 2019...Due to a lot of luck (gambling) + a bit of research I was able to double my account in a month. I was elated, I had made all of my high school losses back and more! But I became greedy and quickly fell into my old gambling habits. The money was once again all gone (profit + principal) by the end of February 2020. I am now super disappointed in myself and feel very ashamed and guilty for doing this again. I work so hard and save all of my money and then just gamble it away...even when the universe gives me another chance I still haven't learned my lesson with greed. What is wrong with me? Why couldn't I just be happy with what I had? It was more than enough to need at my age.

This is when things started to fall apart fast and my depression started to return. Covid hit my city at the beginning of March and my university classes were cancelled and moved online. I was able to scrape by and receive credit for all of my courses, but my anxiety was super high the whole time...because I am on academic probation, if I had failed one more I would have been kicked out entirely. It was just a few days into the pandemic that I realized the guy I had been ""dating"" for 3 months wasn't actually being exclusive with me even though we agreed to be...I had to ""break up"" with him for that reason but still can't stop thinking about him. I am gay and it was my first what I thought to be ""real relationship"" with a guy. We talked on the phone for several hours and both cried but I don't feel like I can move on from him. I feel alone and miss him almost every day even though he cheated on me. I want to hate him but I just can't since I know he's been through some shit in life and uses sex to cope with his traumas...

Without him + university, my social interaction dwindled substantially and due to losing most of my money I felt like I needed to make it back right away so I (stupidly) agreed to work full time at my previously part time grocery store job. The pandemic has made things hell at work for the past 3 months and they are only now starting to improve. Wearing a mandatory mask for 8 hours takes a toll on a person, as does having customers yell and threaten you. I have had to get tested twice for covid because there was an outbreak at my store and I was under mandatory isolation at home for 2 weeks since my coworker tested positive. Due to the stress of all of this, I developed shingles (which young people are not supposed to get) and had to deal with extreme pain + itching for a week. It gave my some time off work though, so I guess that was a good thing?

I know things can get better with time and help, but honestly I feel like I have no purpose in life anymore. I am failing miserably at my other job which I thought was going to be my first career...this is making me reconsider my whole degree and all of the money I have potentially wasted. I feel worthless some days and don't get out of bed or leave my room on my days off work. I have stopped eating regularly and have no energy to due simple tasks. The only things that bring me joy right now are trading (even though I know I shouldn't be), video games, and sleeping. I've never attempted but I have thought about the ways in which to kill myself and think about suicide almost every day. I thought my antidepressants would help but I don't notice much of a difference even after taking them for the past couple of months...Maybe counselling can ""fix"" me or help me work through my issues, but even then what's the point?

2- Unemployed never been able to hold onto a job more than 18 months all my life. I bought a house and i cant find a job and i am in the hospital i had some saved money but its gonna run out and eventually bank is gonna take the house back and i don’t care whats gonna happen to me but i am worried about my dad. 

3-Hospitalized because I haven’t been able to eat anything in two weeks and passed out in the kitchen while cooking for my dad. Bunch of 2nd degree oil burns. Almost burned the house down and my wounds are infected and they are not doing good because I still cant eat anything i am so weak i take breaks even while writing this. Now i have stomach ulcers apparently and doctors doesn’t say to my face but i can see they think i am entitled brat for still not being able to eat while people have real problems in their life. 

4- Reached out to my “friends” most emphatic response i got was ‘yeah you will be sad for a while’ reached out online to forums and support groups. There was few people asking me how i was doing then they got fed up with me I guess they haven’t been texting. Everyone keeps telling me move on and forget but no one is telling me how to do that. And I am not sure if i want to. 

I am either sad or i feel nothing and i am holding onto the sadness cuz not feeling anything scares me worse. I have been there for 15 years I don’t want to go trough it again I don’t think i can take another 15 years of it i am 30 in couple of months. 

Apparently i ruin everything i touch and I kept telling me after everything things will get better I will survive I don’t believe that anymore. Nothing gets better in my life ever. If i get happiness for a while every time it becomes worse thats what my life is pockets of happiness between a downhill run. Every time gives me hope every time i crush and burn. I don’t have the will to fight anymore. 

I can just tell I refuse treatment and go home and die in a week or two. My dad will have the house have less debt. Sure he will be sad for a while but he will be over it eventually. All I did was bring him misery anyway. I have been in the hospital for 5 days and had 0 visitors no one cares about my existence anyway why should i keep fighting just to continue to be a burden. 

I told him help me survive this I don’t want to die and he just stopped answering me. I waited an hour 3 am holding my phone in my hand trying not fall asleep so i don’t miss if he messaged me. I got angry and called him out on what he was doing and the response was “what the fuck do you want me to say? i didnt have a response cuz you basically said the same thing i already responded to. i had to eat get ready for my stream. you are a grown woman. you need to take responsibility for yourself. we are not together anymore. what you are doing is toxic, for the both of us. i cant make you feel better because the second i dont live up to your demands you pull this shit. you know what i was doing.” The person i loved more than myself ladies and gentlemen I didn’t want to be in a relationship again. I wanned him to be my friend. He can’t even do that. People keep telling he is a piece of shit but I still love him and others calling him bad names makes me feel worse about myself because I still love him after everything. I keep reading all his messages where he says hateful things at me and I feel worse and i am glad I felt worse cuz if not i am not gonna feel nothing and when i stop feeling sad and start feeling empty inside I don’t wanna do that again.

,SuicideWatch," Man....  


I'm exhausted.  


Just as good as fucked.  


Tired of playing the tough guy. Tired of working excessively hard to survive. Fed up of this shit.  


You know, life is hard. Everyone is suffering. No one can help or give two shits about me. Everyone is say, occupied.  


I didn't say life is easy. But it shouldn't be hard all the time. And I'm exhausted.  


But I have to fight on to survive. How? By working excessively hard to the point of mental exhaustion.  


I can't get a job. South Korea is known damn well for unemployment. If you want a job, you have to be highly educated. Since everyone's well-educated, the stakes are high. You might ask, ""Start your own company."" Can't. The big companies will liquidate every chance of that!  


Same shit goes to US. Since the economy's screwed since the recession, it's hard to get a job. Since US has high expenses, that's also a minus. To survive in US, I have to do the same horseshit like I do here! Being competitive, working your backs off to be highly educated, and basically getting exhausted.  


And what the hell did I learn? Life is hard everywhere. UK is losing healthcare because of US, for instance.  


No matter where I go, I have to work my ass off to barely survive. So tired of this shit.  


When I was in my early 20s, I wanted to do what I wanted to do. My father opposed this shit. Since life is hard, I had to toughen up. That is no crying, sacrifice your life and be up to standards of the snobby elites. Work to the point of passing out and die. I think that's the resolve. Maybe he was partially right. And I'm getting frustrated.  


Who needs to commit suicide when you overwork and burn out? When you can die from it?  


I'm a religious man and I can't commit suicide (I'm not asking you to proselytize). But I can overwork and die instead.  


But instead of dying, I can go psychotic. Since I have Bipolar disorder, I can explode and have a mental breakdown. I can really harm someone.  


So what's the point of grinding on? It gets me nowhere. I'm done with this mind-wrack.

The last... YEAR or something, has just been such a mess, its a miracle im still around i wont lie.

WELL then he broke up with me. Specially because im a depressed mess. Got so bad i got fucking cops called to my house because i was set on killing myself.

Mother death, with her ghostly pale face, pink lips, and everescent smile, her two golden eyes that shine brighter then even the sun itself. She is often misunderstood in her endeavours. She has a garden in her kingdom, you wouldn’t believe but yes a garden. Laid out in the darkest depths of her household where even the ground runs black in its dirt, and from that dark ground mother death plants her seeds, she takes sincere care of each and every plant, her sunflowers, her beautiful sunflowers. You see mother death simply lives with her sunflowers. They span acres of ashen land, from the black as the yellow flowers emerge atop their green stems. Mother death lives in hell. Its her home, like any racial equality clause she didn’t have much of a choice and frankly the darkness made her quite emo. 

Her neighbour hood is truly plagued by the human disease known as death, but mother death, the women herself she plants her sunflowers. She tends to her acres And acres of land, taking sweet care with every little sunflower, talking sweetly to the wilted ones as she feeds them some extra water from the river styx. A magical solution to help her garden grow. She sings melancholy songs to her dying sunflowers and sweet ones to her babies, still growing from the ashen ground. 

You see, mother death loves her sunflowers, and her eternal love and devotion to her billions of sunflowers has grounded them all deep within the roots of the hellian ground, a mystic land holding mystical powers. But mother death the sweet lady in her black flowy dress with the gentle smile the lady who sang to sunflowers, she lived in hell, she lived among those exiled and ya know racial property discrimination yaddda yadda yadda you get the picture. Anyway, there was a hound dog, larger than any elephant in the human world, he belonged to a viscous man who lived up high at the end of the dark ashen road behind big barren gates with ivory curling around its metal, in a big black and red mansion. Mother death had never met the man, she simply tended to her sunflowers everyday, she’d sing to every single one everyday and pour her love and soul into them. Some sunflowers moved closer in clusters their roots interiorising under the dark ground. 

Mother death kept singing and they kept flourishing, deepening their roots into the magic more powerful then the ancient powers. Mother death loved her sunflowers, one day as she tended to her younglings and sang through her field, the big black dog with the red dog tag made his way over the fence without mother death knowing. He in all his brute ran towards mother death, who in her blissful singing was unaware. Her sunflowers ailed and weeped for her to listen to move to do anything but st
and there but mother death didn’t hear their distress. In an attempt to protect her from a mauling the sunflowers cluttered and pushed their roots from the dark ashen earth, protecting their mother, the women who fed them, sang to them and raised them the women who showed them love. They fussed their roots in a defence against the big black hound. All together standing as one. But they were measly sunflowers no matter how powerful their powers weren’t match for a hell hound. With its big sharp teeth in its massive mouth the hound bit through the sunflower roots, ripping and shredding and using his paws to keep digging. The sunflowers cried for their mother who in her song heard their distress she turned around to see the brute hound ripping out her sunflowers and shredding them. She wailed and mother death ran towards the animal. You see did I mention her eyes glowed gold? Like brighter then the sun? Yeah she was a terrifying image, her black flowing dress her pale face, her plump lips her bright angry eyes and her mother’s battle cry. She pulled up her dress and ran for the brute. He like any sane animal or human was afraid of the wailing mother. He grabbed the roots on the flower and put the sunflowers in his mouth and chucked them, with all his might. He called up the powers of the man whose house he is to guard, the devil himself and through the use of Magic also or maybe more ancient he sent the flowers and their wailing cried up upon the earth to land on mother earths land. He then ran, but the poor mutt, he got lost on mother deaths acres and acres of land. Mother death herself didn’t run she sat in the spot of the old flowers and weeped with all her might, she fixed the patch of soil now empty and bare. And cried. The mutt still running for a way out simply couldn’t find one, he knew mother death would be coming for him the kind gentle lady whose world he had ripped apart, but no matter where the mutt ran there were only sunflowers it was as if the lady had billions planted. He knew Mother Death would find him and he also knew that she had spent time fixing up the land he ripped, he knew what would happened if she found him. He in his fear started ripping out more sunflowers, in different patches accross the mothers flowering field as to not raise a trail, he chucked them all with his might into the face of Mother Earth. Mother death in her grief heard her children cry  and she followed the sounds, she found broken apart land and every time she’d sit there and tend her children, she’d fix the land and weep. This continued the hound would rip the wailing sunflowers and fling them to earth, mother death would follow in her grief to every site and would cry every time and fix up the land. 

Between all this chaos, Mother Earth who was content in her home heard wailing and screeching she was concerned, she looked and looked and found sunflowers, sitting upon the imprint of the earth all crying out in despair. Mother Earth asked the sunflowers what was wrong and they explained the mutt and mother deaths despair. And Mother Earth hearing another mothers pain extended a hand, she bellowed into the hells over mother deaths field in her godly voice, “mother death I see and hear your despair I grant your hurting heart a favour for these sunflowers, I cannot send them back to hell as I am from a different world. But mother death how may I take care of these flowers with love upon my earth” 

Mother death in her grief cried out “curse this mutt, and his owner who shall pay for my pain. I want you to sculpt them all in my image, give them a soul so they can truly leave love, but I want them to come home, I need them to come home, to fill my barren fields and ashy ground” 

Mother Earth understood her prayers, she gave the sunflowers souls and she made them exactly like mother death but more like a normal version of her a more human version. Pale skin, the form of a god, but lack of abilities. She gave ten souls and they were sunflowers they’re true make. She crafted mother deaths springs of love into children. Every time the hound would chuck more sunflowers on the earth and mother death would wail, Mother Earth would take the crying flowers and give them life and purpose upon her face. This cycle would never end because the mutt was an idiot who’d never find his way out of mother deaths acres of farm and mother death would mourn every sunflower that was ripped from its roots.

That is why, when the final embrace comes, Mother death is there her arms open wide her back flowy dress, it’s all too familiar warmth. She’s not there to take you away or to hurt or manipulate you. Mother death opens her arms to take you back to the garden from which you were made. You fear what you don’t remember and she soothes you “we’re going back home” she says and everyday she lives in fear or losing ore of her flowers and grief of he ones she loses but she moves on because everyday her children come back to her garden to finally rest. And THATSSS WHY mother death is misunderstood

and there but mother death didn’t hear their distress. In an attempt to protect her from a mauling the sunflowers cluttered and pushed their roots from the dark ashen earth, protecting their mother, the women who fed them, sang to them and raised them the women who showed them love. They fussed their roots in a defence against the big black hound. All together standing as one. But they were measly sunflowers no matter how powerful their powers weren’t match for a hell hound. With its big sharp teeth in its massive mouth the hound bit through the sunflower roots, ripping and shredding and using his paws to keep digging. The sunflowers cried for their mother who in her song heard their distress she turned around to see the brute hound ripping out her sunflowers and shredding them. She wailed and mother death ran towards the animal. You see did I mention her eyes glowed gold? Like brighter then the sun? Yeah she was a terrifying image, her black flowing dress her pale face, her plump lips her bright angry eyes and her mother’s battle cry. She pulled up her dress and ran for the brute. He like any sane animal or human was afraid of the wailing mother. He grabbed the roots on the flower and put the sunflowers in his mouth and chucked them, with all his might. He called up the powers of the man whose house he is to guard, the devil himself and through the use of Magic also or maybe more ancient he sent the flowers and their wailing cried up upon the earth to land on mother earths land. He then ran, but the poor mutt, he got lost on mother deaths acres and acres of land. Mother death herself didn’t run she sat in the spot of the old flowers and weeped with all her might, she fixed the patch of soil now empty and bare. And cried. The mutt still running for a way out simply couldn’t find one, he knew mother death would be coming for him the kind gentle lady whose world he had ripped apart, but no matter where the mutt ran there were only sunflowers it was as if the lady had billions planted. He knew Mother Death would find him and he also knew that she had spent time fixing up the land he ripped, he knew what would happened if she found him. He in his fear started ripping out more sunflowers, in different patches accross the mothers flowering field as to not raise a trail, he chucked them all with his might into the face of Mother Earth. Mother death in her grief heard her children cry  and she followed the sounds, she found broken apart land and every time she’d sit there and tend her children, she’d fix the land and weep. This continued the hound would rip the wailing sunflowers and fling them to earth, mother death would follow in her grief to every site and would cry every time and fix up the land. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Between all this chaos, Mother Earth who was content in her home heard wailing and screeching she was concerned, she looked and looked and found sunflowers, sitting upon the imprint of the earth all crying out in despair. Mother Earth asked the sunflowers what was wrong and they explained the mutt and mother deaths despair. And Mother Earth hearing another mothers pain extended a hand, she bellowed into the hells over mother deaths field in her godly voice, “mother death I see and hear your despair I grant your hurting heart a favour for these sunflowers, I cannot send them back to hell as I am from a different world. But mother death how may I take care of these flowers with love upon my earth” &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mother death in her grief cried out “curse this mutt, and his owner who shall pay for my pain. I want you to sculpt them all in my image, give them a soul so they can truly leave love, but I want them to come home, I need them to come home, to fill my barren fields and ashy ground” &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mother Earth understood her prayers, she gave the sunflowers souls and she made them exactly like mother death but more like a normal version of her a more human version. Pale skin, the form of a god, but lack of abilities. She gave ten souls and they were sunflowers they’re true make. She crafted mother deaths springs of love into children. Every time the hound would chuck more sunflowers on the earth and mother death would wail, Mother Earth would take the crying flowers and give them life and purpose upon her face. This cycle would never end because the mutt was an idiot who’d never find his way out of mother deaths acres of farm and mother death would mourn every sunflower that was ripped from its roots.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That is why, when the final embrace comes, Mother death is there her arms open wide her back flowy dress, it’s all too familiar warmth. She’s not there to take you away or to hurt or manipulate you. Mother death opens her arms to take you back to the garden from which you were made. You fear what you don’t remember and she soothes you “we’re going back home” she says and everyday she lives in fear or losing ore of her flowers and grief of he ones she loses but she moves on because everyday her children come back to her garden to finally rest. And THATSSS WHY mother death is misunderstood &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And it’s also why all white people go to hell ;)&lt;/p&gt;

,SuicideWatch,"Hi to all of you,

so I (male, over 28) am here at the psychiatric hospital close to 4 weeks. Had some deep lows and many suicidal thoughts but after dosing up to 225 mg Venlafaxine at least I don't experience the deep lows anymore. (CAUTION: In some patients antidepressants can increase the suicide risk. Possibly because they first increase drive but not mood. So you still feel depressed but now you have more energy to act on your suicidal thoughts. Always talk to your doctor!)

I try to participate in every therapy described and get up at 7-7:30 am during the week and 8:00:8:30 on the weekends.

I still often feel hopeless about the future (job, economy, family) but I hope this gets better, too.

One thing I experienced already as a child is feeling hurt by minor social - how should I say it? - events.

For example, today other patients played a board game at 11 am. I decided to join because I thought it would be good to have some contact with the other patients. Off course, we were interrupted  by lunch and decided to continue afterwards. So I waited in the lounge and nobody appeared. A nice “girl“ (18-19? I am at least ten years older) offeres to ask her roomate whether they changed plans (visiting patients in their rooms is not allowed). So she came back and said they decided to continue at 2 pm. When I returned again at that time now other people were missing. One declared he wasn't interested anymore, the other person just did not show up.
So “we“ decided to quit it.

I know this sounds unimportant but these things always hurt me. Especially because I did not wrote a letter which I wanted at 11 am.

When I got back to my room I felt very lonely without any friend in the world. And then the thoughts about unemployment came back and I thought it would be better just to end everything.

I will, however, NOT DO THAT! I will keep on fighting. And so, I hope, will every reader of this post.

Well, she dug deep which resulted in me crashing down in tears in her office and when I came home I planned it all out, drew it, wrote where, how, when. This is scary. I even took a rope and tied it into a snare and put it under my bed, like, I'm ready.

I've never been this close to a suicide and I'm scared, especially because it all blacked out and I didn't realize what I really had done until I made the snare. What if next time I won't realize until I've hung myself?
 
I'm still in bed lol, been for 5h after that. 2h of those is staring at my roof trying to grasp what the fuck I've done.

,SuicideWatch,"Hello, I am writting this because I need to tell someone or something this. I'm 15 and have a sister. My parents are what I would call superficial, they don't care about things if they don't interfere with them, basically aslong as I can smile and act good and well for other people to see a healthy and smart son they couldn't care less, thing is my grades are not top notch so my mom kinda tries to motivate me on the other hand my dad judges me for everything i do, I can feel it so I avoid any visual contact.
Then we have my sister which for complicated reasons has cut ties with me and basically sees me as a normal person, we don't speak ever basically, she is the best trading card my parents have and the main topic for every conversation, she spends her whole days studying. She is basically the best student at everything and I feel compared to her at everything I do.
My mind has some problems and I can't think of myself doing anything successful without it trying to shut it off or turning it into something bad, whenever I think of a girl I have a crush on or something it painfully rejects it, I don't even know how to explain it, I can't have good dreams either it is all just stopped so I can't even find happiness inside my head in fantasies which I have for the first 10 years of my life.
So basically at this point I feel like a worthless and neglected son, from here I would turn on friends for company or support but I have come to not trust anyone for some reason, everything in my head is bad, that person bad that other person bad etc, making matters worse i'm pretty sure my school life has always been a symbiotic one in which I would find myself in groups of ""friends"" that would always be toxic and rude and distasteful.
I would make my way back home knowing everything that happened was probably a lie, and would have to then endure the home life which was worse, I would have to not talk because my sister was studying, and god knows what would happen, she would move further away in the house but nobody would tell me so I would end up having to stay silent and avoid playing with my friends online which was something I enjoyed until recently.
Now my days are wake up do school stuff, spend the morning thinking, have lunch in which I'm pretty sure my dad chews loudly so that I get pissed of, can't say anything or else would get slapped and ground for a month, go to my room I don't even get enjoyment out of games or books alike, recently I have used my time to organize my room to pass time, reach dinner and my dad pisses me off again, also if my sister is on the table I will get completely ignored, and then I go to bed where I have to sleep hearing my sister doing god knows what in her room and calling it studying until 5 am.
Also I have to do as little to no sound if she is sleeping, she sleeps until like 15, because she can wake up but then if I'm trying to sleep until 10 or 12 and everyone is up except me nobody cares, my mom comes into the room not even knocking, they never do, my sister slams evey door, and my dad does nothing because he does aproach me if he doesn't need me.
I'm pretty sure nobody likes me and judges me and makes fun of me behind my back, be it in school or my family, I'm not good looking or good at social stuff, I'm aldo pretty sure I'm pansexual so I can't tell anyone or it will even be worse. My mind feels like it is trying to kill me mentaly.
Probably at this point nobody would actually be sad about my death so yeah I don't want to keep doing this either, when covid is cured or I can leave the house freely I will probably if I can find the courage throw myself off a building head first into the ground.
I spend at least 3 hours trying to sleep but I can't because I'm having suicidal thoughts, it all starts with me not remembering the last time I heard my parents telling me they loved me or they showing some signs of affection.

,SuicideWatch,"My life is the same mundane shit over and over again. I pretty much work a shitty freelance graphic design job and live with my parents. I used to live on my own a few years ago when work was better but now I've been sentenced to a living nightmare for almost ten years. I keep struggling to make ends meet no matter what I do, going more and more into debt as the days go by, while I get rejection emails from every worthwhile lucrative salary jobs I've applied to and I've only got one job offer from a local grocery store who only want someone to work part-time for shitty minimum wage that's not worth my time. Keep in mind that I have a college degree and multiple years of experience in marketing and graphic design.

My parents also don't really communicate with me because they've been abused mentally all their lives by their culture's bullshit and have submitted the quality of their lives to their family's choices. They just ask me the generic ""how are you?"" and that's it, thinking that's enough without actually caring about how I'm really doing. I absolutely love my parents, but I hate how they've just provided for me the essentials (food, clothes, roof over my head) without ever thinking of preparing me for life's countless hardships or to teach me how to observe and understand my emotions effectively as a child so that I can grow up to be mentally stable as an adult.

The fucking cherry on top that completely makes my life a complete living hell is my heartless, hateful, egomaniac of a younger brother who doesn't give a fuck about anyone but himself and who tortures me and my parents on a daily basis. He's always high off his ass and talking loudly and getting worked up about stupid shit, which makes me and my parents always on edge and scared. He also talks to himself while cussing nonstop, as if he's fighting an imaginary person, and sings obnoxiously loud throughout the day and in the early mornings to clearly get on mine and my parents nerves. I've tried talking to him, pleading with him, debating with him, reason with him every way possible, sympathizing with him to better understand him, physically fought him when he decided to attack me out of anger, called the cops on him to protect my parents, but everything I've tried was to no avail. My efforts are hopelessly futile.

My lack of sleep and my constant exposure to my brother's drama has permanently traumatized me. He's threatened me and my parents physically and legally if I ever try to commit him or get him arrested. The funny thing is, he has a good job that makes him good money yet he still makes everyone miserable, mentally torturing my parents just because he can and has no sympathy at all for us.

I seriously don't know what else to do. He is a fucking nightmare that I cannot escape and neither can my parents. My dad's also sick with an enlarged prostate and my mom is a timid, feeble older woman who can't put her foot down, she just keeps taking his shit and coddling him despite how much she mentally suffers from his verbal abuse. I don't want this abuse to happen to my parents anymore and I don't want to hurt them by taking my life, but I don't know what else to do other than end my suffering. Maybe then my family finally will realize how good of a son I really was and my death will also let them finally see how much of a narcissistic piece of shit my brother is and have him committed indefinitely.

I&amp;#39;ve tried talking to him, pleading with him, debating with him, reason with him every way possible, sympathizing with him to better understand him, physically fought him when he decided to attack me out of anger, called the cops on him to protect my parents, but everything I&amp;#39;ve tried was to no avail. My efforts are hopelessly futile.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My lack of sleep and my constant exposure to my brother&amp;#39;s drama has permanently traumatized me. He&amp;#39;s threatened me and my parents physically and legally if I ever try to commit him or get him arrested. The funny thing is, he has a good job that makes him good money yet he still makes everyone miserable, mentally torturing my parents just because he can and has no sympathy at all for us.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I seriously don&amp;#39;t know what else to do. He is a fucking nightmare that I cannot escape and neither can my parents. My dad&amp;#39;s also sick with an enlarged prostate and my mom is a timid, feeble older woman who can&amp;#39;t put her foot down, she just keeps taking his shit and coddling him despite how much she mentally suffers from his verbal abuse. I don&amp;#39;t want this abuse to happen to my parents anymore and I don&amp;#39;t want to hurt them by taking my life, but I don&amp;#39;t know what else to do other than end my suffering. Maybe then my family finally will realize how good of a son I really was and my death will also let them finally see how much of a narcissistic piece of shit my brother is and have him committed indefinitely.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;EDIT: I want to kill myself and I am ready to end it all now. I&amp;#39;m absolutely done with this shitty life and the people in it.&lt;/p&gt;

I have no friends I can talk to.

I don't want to push him further away. 

I just feel like I'm being so childish and pathetic and I don't know what to do to make it stop. I'm sitting in the bathroom trying to both cry quietly and post this bc I feel like I'm right on the edge.

,SuicideWatch,"I'm 27 years old and I've been contemplating suicide for going on 15 years. I'm not sure if everything fits here or if I'm going to ramble; I just want to get it off my chest. 

I honestly don't even know where to start so I'll just start from the beginning. When I was about 12 years old my parents got a divorce. If I had to speak honestly I wish both of them would die. 

My mother is what I think to be suffering from borderline personality disorder; she is insufferable to talk to about anything. When I told her that I was attracted to men her response was ""How could you do this to me?"" When I try to talk to her about anything going on in my life she dismisses it and then turns the conversation to her and her problems. I didn't for a long time have a problem with that, but over the last few years as my depression has gotten worse it's tiresome to be dismissed and then be asked to fix her problems. 

My father is arrogant to the extreme. I lived with him for a while to try to start a new life somewhere else. I didn't really successed there. I'm fairly certain he lynched someone. He has a noose, with the hangman's knot and a tattered cut about 3-4 feet from the noose, which he hung proudly in his office for years. His solution to everything when I lived with him was to drink, and it lead me to develop a heavy drinking problem for about 5 years. He blamed me, just as he blamed my sister, for drinking. 

When my parents got divorced I spent the week days at my mom's and the weekends at my dad's. Something strange about when they first got divorced is that I can't remember my bedroom in his apartment. I can remember everything else about it just not my bedroom. I don't have any memory of it, but I think this period is when I got raped for the first time. I always felt uneasy around my father, like something was just right and it was more than the noose (didn't learn about until I was 18), it was more than his day to day behavior, it's always just been a gut feeling. One of the last things my sister said to me before she died was that she had the same uneasy feeling about him and how she had thought she had seen it happening. 

When I went off to college I had this feeling of freedom, this feeling I could change everything. It faded quickly. I failed a lot in college, in high school I never studied and passed with a 3.5, in college I studied but could never retain the information nor fully understood the concepts. I thought I understood them, but essays were always returned with poor grades. It really started to sink in there that I wouldn't amount to anything, and that feeling has proven to be true. 

Since college I've worked countless job, and I've walked out or been fired from every one of them. These aren't office jobs, they're low paying jobs with no prestige. Pick and packer, bus boy, substitute teacher, just to name a few. The degree I got is absolutely useless, what kind of company is looking for a Political Science major with a minor in Anthropology and no reliable work experience. I know I should of chosen a different major, something practical, at the time I had a delusion that a degree meant I could get a job I wanted. 

Shortly after I graduated was when I believe I was raped again by my father. Again I don't remember the act, but I remember what it felt like waking up. It felt like I had been suffocated, like my face had been held into the pillow and it was hard to breathe and my face felt sore. My anus also hurt, it was swollen and it just felt like I had been penetrated, at this point I had experimented with anal play and I knew what it felt like to have had something up there. 

I've never had consensual sex. I've tried several times, but I get scared and then push them away or say something repulsive to make them lose interest. Consequently, I've never been loved by someone else. I don't really even know if I do know what it feels like to be loved. 

I think about suicide all the time, at this point its just a passing thought most the time like I should do the dishes, I should load the shot gun and just end it. Not long ago I was drinking and ended up telling my dad I was going to do it and I got sent to a mental institution for 5 days. They did nothing to help me there. 

It's hard for me to make friends, I've become bitter and angry at the world and can't connect to anyone. I just end up pushing them away. 

I don't really want to say anymore, I could probably write a book on it all. If you've made it this far that cool I guess. I don't want to die but I really don't want to live anymore.

Edit : I'm just going to get more out. When I was in college I started to have flashbacks of my early childhood. One that stood out was a hand reaching out to my face and a voice screaming "" faggot"" I have 4 scars on the left side of my face, all of them facing the same direction and all of them in a position suggesting they happened at the same time. I confronted my mom about it because it sounds like her voice, but she broke into tears when I suggested it and told me I got them when I was an infant from scratching my face. I don't know what to think about them or the 'memory' they're just something that has bothered me for a long time.

,SuicideWatch,"Last week I was arrested for a DUI because I was driving 5 hours after smoking a joint. I was not even driving for 20 seconds before I was arrested and kept in a holding cell for 4 hours where I was then let out and allowed to drive again. I don't drink and I don't use any other drugs. Weed helps relax me and I would never smoke and immediately drive, I really do care about people.

I've been talking to friends and contacting lawyers but nobody understands the weight of the repercussions for DUI here in the UK. I will be banned from driving and I will have a criminal record.

In the past I have had mental health issues and have been in hospital twice for attempting to take my life. I managed to ""get over it"" with a lot of support from people and overcoming the hardships I had suffered. I made it my goal that I wanted to be a scientist and help people and I've been working on it for the past 5 years of my life since I did not get good grades in school as a result of my condition. Nonetheless, I told myself that I would learn pharmacology and I would work on helping people. I managed to achieve good grades and I've been searching for a job for the past year but now this will all be affected.

I feel like I've let myself down and I've let my family down. My father has had surgery in the past year and is disabled as a result of it and I drive him around everywhere, it kills me that I have let him down.  
I've worked so hard on building a good image and reputation within my community by helping others and now I will be labeled as a common criminal since I am involved with ""drugs"".

I've faced many challenges in life but this is too much. I've worked so hard to get to this point and it will be ruined by a punishment that outweighs the reality of the crime. Justice is not being served and the laws surrounding it are perverse and unjust. I know I dont deserve this but it is making me feel so shitty about myself.

I dont want to continue with life like this, it's unfair to have gone through all of this to receive this kind of treatment and punishment. My family dont talk to me the same, my friends dont know how I feel and now the world will see me as someone horrible regardless of the crime committed. Since I last attempted to end my life I was so lonely and had no one, it felt like a bottomless pit. But since then I have made it my duty to be there for anyone who might not have a friend or someone to talk to so that they never end up in the situation I am in. I feel like I have let them down too.

It feels extremely selfish of me to want to end my life but I don't see any other way out of this.

I managed to achieve good grades and I&amp;#39;ve been searching for a job for the past year but now this will all be affected.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I feel like I&amp;#39;ve let myself down and I&amp;#39;ve let my family down. My father has had surgery in the past year and is disabled as a result of it and I drive him around everywhere, it kills me that I have let him down.&lt;br/&gt;
I&amp;#39;ve worked so hard on building a good image and reputation within my community by helping others and now I will be labeled as a common criminal since I am involved with &amp;quot;drugs&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve faced many challenges in life but this is too much. I&amp;#39;ve worked so hard to get to this point and it will be ruined by a punishment that outweighs the reality of the crime. Justice is not being served and the laws surrounding it are perverse and unjust. I know I dont deserve this but it is making me feel so shitty about myself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I dont want to continue with life like this, it&amp;#39;s unfair to have gone through all of this to receive this kind of treatment and punishment. My family dont talk to me the same, my friends dont know how I feel and now the world will see me as someone horrible regardless of the crime committed. Since I last attempted to end my life I was so lonely and had no one, it felt like a bottomless pit. But since then I have made it my duty to be there for anyone who might not have a friend or someone to talk to so that they never end up in the situation I am in. I feel like I have let them down too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It feels extremely selfish of me to want to end my life but I don&amp;#39;t see any other way out of this. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I can&amp;#39;t live with myself like this.&lt;/p&gt;

I’m hoping that someone can relate to this as I can not express how I feel to anyone, so I’m an 28 years old, I have a decent job and have had a decent upbringing and social network of friends and family. So yeah perfect life right? So why do I think every day without fail if I could take a pill to end my life I would, even the good days I think about it. I have no idea if I have any mental illness as I have never seeked help. I have never attempted to end my life as I would not want my mother to go through any pain of me doing it or feel for any reason she may blame herself for my actions. From a young age I’ve have always had a feeling I would die young, I have times where I have spoke to friends and family recently about feeling low but brush it off as I don’t want people to feel like they need to check on me. I work in a hospital currently during the pandemic and I have no fear at all towards the virus. I constantly when I get a symptom of anything serious look it up to see if I have an terminal Illness and this may sound weird but I hope that I do, I think this may be due to the fact it could end my life without people having to question anything. I can’t help but feel selfish as I know people care about me yet I feel lonely. I feel extremely guilty for how I feel as I know people suffer much more everyday. It’s almost like I want to leave a room quietly without people watching me questioning where I’m going and not notice I’ve gone so it doesn’t affect their life and feelings.

Does anyone else have any similar feelings?

,SuicideWatch,"I come from a background with a number of things that are just now starting to hit me. I have a problem that is not being addressed. I've been told i have depression but I know there is something else. 

I've recently develeoped a change where I have these anger outbursts, euphoria, mood swings, self harm, over indulge/ somewhat impulsive, attachment issues, empty, constant suicidal thoughts, etc. 

I'm not sure if I'm being overtly critical of my psychiatrist (who i might have grown to like a lot a lot since I've opened up to them. Normally not my type.)....but I'm not sure they're listening to me. I was told that I have ""Depressive disorder"" i know I'm depressed but I'm sure it's more since I've lived with it most of my years. I know something's different.
I'm not listened to because no one cares.  I like to think I'm a good person but my mood is so angry or unnecessary.

Just like half the population my parents divorced. 

I come from very nice beginings of living in a drug house where I was neglected. Instability was amazing. At a young age, I was abandoned and left in the care of the other parent. I questioned if it was my fault. I learned that it was not just poor decisions on their part. 
Emotional abuse came with the transition of moving with the other parent which made me believe i was stupid. In a sense, i still believe this. 
Unknowingly, I was molested by a foster kid who was much older than I. I never felt so dirty. I lost my innocenece that day. 

That parent returned after all these years. Harsh punishment was enforced. I thought about suicide for the first time. Greatly considered it. 

The party doesn't stop! Then we were homeless (slept in cars) and had to sit waiting for days for food to come.

I have a problem that is not being addressed. I&amp;#39;ve been told i have depression but I know there is something else. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve recently develeoped a change where I have these anger outbursts, euphoria, mood swings, self harm, over indulge/ somewhat impulsive, attachment issues, empty, constant suicidal thoughts, etc. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m not sure if I&amp;#39;m being overtly critical of my psychiatrist (who i might have grown to like a lot a lot since I&amp;#39;ve opened up to them. Normally not my type.)....but I&amp;#39;m not sure they&amp;#39;re listening to me. I was told that I have &amp;quot;Depressive disorder&amp;quot; i know I&amp;#39;m depressed but I&amp;#39;m sure it&amp;#39;s more since I&amp;#39;ve lived with it most of my years. I know something&amp;#39;s different.
I&amp;#39;m not listened to because no one cares.  I like to think I&amp;#39;m a good person but my mood is so angry or unnecessary.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just like half the population my parents divorced. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I come from very nice beginings of living in a drug house where I was neglected. Instability was amazing. At a young age, I was abandoned and left in the care of the other parent. I questioned if it was my fault. I learned that it was not just poor decisions on their part. 
Emotional abuse came with the transition of moving with the other parent which made me believe i was stupid. In a sense, i still believe this. 
Unknowingly, I was molested by a foster kid who was much older than I. I never felt so dirty. I lost my innocenece that day. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That parent returned after all these years. Harsh punishment was enforced. I thought about suicide for the first time. Greatly considered it. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The party doesn&amp;#39;t stop! Then we were homeless (slept in cars) and had to sit waiting for days for food to come. 
I was a burden. I had a fucked up childhood and now being 24 it&amp;#39;s just now hitting me. Ever since I was a kid, I dreamt of dying. Now it&amp;#39;s all just now starting to weigh on me.

,SuicideWatch,"Throwaway account, I need to get this out because I cannot tell anyone.

I am 26 (27 in 2 days) and my partner of 5 years has passed away from an aggressive and rare cancer called Cholangiocarcinoma (bile duct cancer) this week. He was 29. He was diagnosed whilst I was 35 weeks pregnant and our son is now 15 months old. In this time, the cancer had been surgically removed, he had received chemo and it had come back and spread significantly. The amount of pain he was in and seeing him deteriorate in the hospice which was supposed to be temporary was so awful for him and everyone involved. He was such a fighter, positive and such a popular guy. I am in so much emotional distress that I am in physical pain. I haven't eaten in 4 days since it happened. I haven't slept. I am almost always in tears and I am trying to plan his funeral.

I have a history of bipolar disorder (current depressive episode, surprise, surprise), an eating disorder which I'm relapsing into and anxiety. I feel awful for being suicidal. He would never want anyone to suffer, especially me. I feel our 15 month old will be better off with grandparents/god parents than having to live with myself. I have people who care. But the pain is too much for me to bare.

I have it planned for the night of his funeral, which by the way, we can only have 10 people at because of Covid. Immediate family, myself and his best friend. We don't know when the funeral will be but I am finding peace in the fact it will end soon. I can't tell anyone as I don't want to be stopped.

This keeps happening to me, I&amp;#39;m too blunt, the things that I saw in my life have made me too different. I don&amp;#39;t know how to talk to people, and finding this out so late is destroying the work that I have done to get to the place I&amp;#39;m at today. I thought I could be myself with this person, obviously not. I don&amp;#39;t want to live anymore. How do I live with myself knowing that I have hurt this person so? I didn&amp;#39;t mean it to come out that way and I see the error now but how do I live knowing that I have hurt people and will most likely continue to hurt people? Do I even deserve to live? I hate myself and as the days go by, I want to die more and more.&lt;/p&gt;

,SuicideWatch,"I've been the kind my whole life to never give up. People have complimented that about me. I am good at endurance and enduring pain, but recently I have come to realize there is nothing worth enduring for.

The only thing I wanted in life was true love. I thought it existed. I wanted a friend, a companion, some one who could say I love you and will always be by your side and mean it. I know I could give the same. Some one who didn't want or expect some specific thing out of me. Money. Sex. Power. Whatever. Some one who just was fond of me and with me because I made them smile, made them laugh, brought them Joy.

I used to think sex was a side effect of love. That you did it with some one because you loved them and that if you both loved each other even if it was awkward at times it would be great and bring you both joy. Nowadays I'm learning the entire relationship is built around sex. Everything is about sex. If not sex, financial security, money, wealth. All that's legitimate and fine and good but what about loving some one because they are  a good friend? Because you find them cute and love to share life with them?

I'm learning this doesn't exist. If it doesn't exist what's the point? Even if some one has a ton of money and is a sexual gladiator, at this point knowing that's the reason they're with you, it feels... I don't know!? What's the point? My mind is starting to spiral. Every day just hurts so badly. I am trying hard to keep working, to keep exercising (I'm in great shape and plan to keep it that way!) but it's becoming unbearable. 

It's not that I want to die, it's that this is just some pointless fucking game and I don't want to play anymore. I always tend to screw things up too, in one way or another. I've never had anyone show me much patience or understanding in any way or help show me what to do. I want so bad to make some one happy, to be their knight in shining armor but I'm never good enough.

What do people do who aren't super sexual? Or who maybe were in a really bad relationship or had some sort of trauma at some point and didn't gain all the sexual experience needed? What if sex is kind of freaky to some one? What if some one just wants it to be a loving intimate thing between them and their partner and they don't have to worry about their performance? Why can't love just be about love and kindness? Do people who have been through these things not deserve true love?

I just want a partner, some one to share life with who won't constantly be judging me and carefully evaluating me at all times. This doesn't exist or is so rare I'll never find it.

I've tried so hard to hang on y'all but it just hurts y'know?

,SuicideWatch,"I‘ve had suicidal thoughts my whole life but they have been getting more and more intrusive as I get older. A lot of people say that committing suicide is selfish. But the way I see it, they’re selfish. I wake up everyday for as long as I remember I’ve been miserable. Every thought is consumed and ruled by my depression and anxiety and the thought of suicide seems like the only true relief I’ll find. I have so few people in my life who really truly care about me. And I’m confident that each one of these few people would be just fine without me in their worlds any longer. They all have loving families, lots of good friends, loving partners and jobs with coworkers they like. Losing me wouldn’t be too bad. I’m just tired of the day to day shittiness. I can’t get free of my mind ever. So the way I see it it’s selfish for someone to ask someone else to continue to be miserable just so they can say hi every now and again. 

I’m just losing my mind I feel.

A lot of people say that committing suicide is selfish. But the way I see it, they’re selfish. I wake up everyday for as long as I remember I’ve been miserable. Every thought is consumed and ruled by my depression and anxiety and the thought of suicide seems like the only true relief I’ll find. I have so few people in my life who really truly care about me. And I’m confident that each one of these few people would be just fine without me in their worlds any longer. They all have loving families, lots of good friends, loving partners and jobs with coworkers they like. Losing me wouldn’t be too bad. I’m just tired of the day to day shittiness. I can’t get free of my mind ever. So the way I see it it’s selfish for someone to ask someone else to continue to be miserable just so they can say hi every now and again. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m just losing my mind I feel. &lt;/p&gt;

I guess I should take this gun to my head tonight since they don't want to help me?

Edit:. No matter how loud I scream for help, wherever I scream for help, it falls on deaf ears.  Called the suicide hotline again and they decided suicide by cop was the way to go. Apparently that's all they do is call police.

I've asked this same question multiple times.  Nobody has an answer and it's really unsettling.  Is it that hard to see a doctor and have them understand anything?  20 years....  I only found out recently the source of one of my bigger misery's can be fixed through surgery, from a random stranger.  It took 6 months, and multiple doctor visits among multiple offices, for a doctor to actually get serious and explain there was a difference between stool softeners and laxatives.

&lt;p&gt;Edit:. No matter how loud I scream for help, wherever I scream for help, it falls on deaf ears.  Called the suicide hotline again and they decided suicide by cop was the way to go. Apparently that&amp;#39;s all they do is call police.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve asked this same question multiple times.  Nobody has an answer and it&amp;#39;s really unsettling.  Is it that hard to see a doctor and have them understand anything?  20 years....  I only found out recently the source of one of my bigger misery&amp;#39;s can be fixed through surgery, from a random stranger.  It took 6 months, and multiple doctor visits among multiple offices, for a doctor to actually get serious and explain there was a difference between stool softeners and laxatives.  First to prescribe a laxative, other doctors mocked me and said to have enemas.&lt;/p&gt;

Idk anymore. It’s been about 6 months since we broke up. Still not over her, atleast that’s what the counselor says. I think she’s right too. Been thinking about her pretty much every single day, can’t even take her off my mind. Idk what it is that I’m feeling. It’s clearly not good that’s for sure. 

My mind keeps creating these scenarios. Like what if she goes with someone else. What if there is someone else making her laugh. What if she starts laughing at me with her friends or someone else she found. And all this is killing me on the inside. I can’t even fall asleep it’s so bad. It’s so hard to actually get into the rhythm of sleeping and when I do sleep I wake up in the middle of the night of some fucked up nightmare. I’m afraid to SLEEP. 

Maybe I need closure? Maybe I’m just afraid of getting with someone else or getting hurt again? Maybe this is really what life has to offer... idk how to stop thinking about her. How do I even move on? Literally everything reminds me of her, even music. I can’t even listen to music without dying on the inside. 

Sometimes I just think to myself I should just walk away from life. Maybe suicide? Or maybe I should run away, start a new life somewhere. I can’t even cry. For some reason I can’t cry. I envy those who do ngl

She was such a beautiful woman. Srsly she was and she used to say such random things that just made me smile. Well I mean I have her everything I had.

,SuicideWatch,"Sorry, long post. Warning in advance. 

Not sure if it's this year of 2020 with all the events going on that is causing more feelings of depression but this has definitely been a very challenging year. Currently my wife is upset with me and this has been happening at least once a week since quarantine where there's one thing she'll get upset about and will stay mad and take it very personal. Whenever she feels upset, she gets hopeless in me and our marriage (we've been married for about 10 months in our late 20s so this is still new and been dating since 2016). I tend to start feeling hopeless in myself too and think about maybe I'm better off dying and letting her start over with someone else since we don't have any kids now to hold me back. 

I'll admit I am not the best at cheering her up and I usually need time to think it over before apologizing. She on the other hand wants me to work on it right away and be able to know what to say or do. Sometimes I feel she is being unreasonably upset and takes things too personally. There could be a bigger root to the problem to why she's this way I'm not sure. However, communication and me leading her has always been an issue in our relationship due to myself having social anxiety and just lacking communication skills overall. I have improved throughout my life but it is still something I want to improve on but at the same time it has been very difficult and I feel it's held me back in a lot of things in life such as relationships and jobs. 

The hardest thing is feeling like I don't belong in this world and that I may never belong. I thought getting a girlfriend and getting married would solve a lot of issues because at one point in my life I thought I was going to end up single forever so I would rather just die young than to suffer living alone. That is until I met my wife. Things were going well in the beginning and I couldn't be more happy to start my life with her and eventually start a family with her. Though it feels like a never ending cycle when she gets mad at me then the feelings of hopelessness comes and then we make up and feel better and I regret feeling that way then it happens again and back and again making me feel like I may never be good enough for her and she will feel like she settled for me or fall out of love from me. 

I do love her very much and can't imagine being with anyone else and I know she loves me too other than the times she gets upset. A part of me wishes at times that I never met her so I wouldn't feel as guilty offing myself and potentially scarring her. I wouldn't ever do it if I wasn't confident that she didn't love me anymore or if she ended up cheating one me. I also would feel guilty about hurting my parents and maybe other family members. I am not close with any of them and they all live in different states so I don't get to see my family often. I also have very few friends and no close enough friends to talk about these things to so that's why I am posting here. 

I am also at a point in my life where I should be having a career and when I compare myself to my peers, I feel so much less accomplished and less of value. I have a job but the pay isn't great and it's not something I see myself doing for very long. I have always had trouble with interviews due to my anxiety and have been rejected by over 100 interviews sadly. Fortunate that I could get that many interviews since my resume looks decent but my social skills kills me in doing well enough in interviews. I feel terrible when I compare myself to those who are more accomplished and doing better at life than me but then I feel guilty when I compare myself to those who have even less than me such as people who make much less money or those who are still single and alone. It makes me think about how why I feel I deserve more than them and why don't they deserve what I currently have? I hate feeling ungrateful about life. 

I am Christian so I believe in God and heaven. I know some people would say if you commit suicide, you're going to hell and others would say it depends and one mistake or sin in your life shouldn't define your life. I believe in the latter because you don't really know everything someones been through and maybe they didn't get the help they needed or feel they can't handle what they're going through anymore when they decided to take their life. For those who believe in God, you can debate all you want but in the end only God gets to decide. 

Finally, to let this off my chest since I don't know how I'll feel again the next day or week. I just feel I needed to post my thoughts and feelings of now. My plans were going to be hanging myself but I know there are chances that could fail and if I were ever going to go through with it, I would not want to fail at all. I also want to keep my body in tact so for any who cares can see me one last time before I'm buried. I would likely go through with using a suicide bag using helium or nitrogen since I would want something painless. I would also write a goodbye note to certain people in my life so they can have some type of closure on why I did it. 

To be honest I don't know if I will ever actually kill myself since I have days where I feel fine and feel I would never go through with it but this past year I have been thinking about it a lot more and have thought about wanting to die since high school. Meeting my wife helped me prolong my life but if our marriage ever completely failed then I don't know what to do with my life anymore and would not want to keep living.

Warning in advance. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not sure if it&amp;#39;s this year of 2020 with all the events going on that is causing more feelings of depression but this has definitely been a very challenging year. Currently my wife is upset with me and this has been happening at least once a week since quarantine where there&amp;#39;s one thing she&amp;#39;ll get upset about and will stay mad and take it very personal. Whenever she feels upset, she gets hopeless in me and our marriage (we&amp;#39;ve been married for about 10 months in our late 20s so this is still new and been dating since 2016). I tend to start feeling hopeless in myself too and think about maybe I&amp;#39;m better off dying and letting her start over with someone else since we don&amp;#39;t have any kids now to hold me back. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ll admit I am not the best at cheering her up and I usually need time to think it over before apologizing. She on the other hand wants me to work on it right away and be able to know what to say or do. Sometimes I feel she is being unreasonably upset and takes things too personally. There could be a bigger root to the problem to why she&amp;#39;s this way I&amp;#39;m not sure. However, communication and me leading her has always been an issue in our relationship due to myself having social anxiety and just lacking communication skills overall. I have improved throughout my life but it is still something I want to improve on but at the same time it has been very difficult and I feel it&amp;#39;s held me back in a lot of things in life such as relationships and jobs. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The hardest thing is feeling like I don&amp;#39;t belong in this world and that I may never belong. I thought getting a girlfriend and getting married would solve a lot of issues because at one point in my life I thought I was going to end up single forever so I would rather just die young than to suffer living alone. That is until I met my wife. Things were going well in the beginning and I couldn&amp;#39;t be more happy to start my life with her and eventually start a family with her. Though it feels like a never ending cycle when she gets mad at me then the feelings of hopelessness comes and then we make up and feel better and I regret feeling that way then it happens again and back and again making me feel like I may never be good enough for her and she will feel like she settled for me or fall out of love from me. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I do love her very much and can&amp;#39;t imagine being with anyone else and I know she loves me too other than the times she gets upset. A part of me wishes at times that I never met her so I wouldn&amp;#39;t feel as guilty offing myself and potentially scarring her. I wouldn&amp;#39;t ever do it if I wasn&amp;#39;t confident that she didn&amp;#39;t love me anymore or if she ended up cheating one me. I also would feel guilty about hurting my parents and maybe other family members. I am not close with any of them and they all live in different states so I don&amp;#39;t get to see my family often. I also have very few friends and no close enough friends to talk about these things to so that&amp;#39;s why I am posting here. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am also at a point in my life where I should be having a career and when I compare myself to my peers, I feel so much less accomplished and less of value. I have a job but the pay isn&amp;#39;t great and it&amp;#39;s not something I see myself doing for very long. I have always had trouble with interviews due to my anxiety and have been rejected by over 100 interviews sadly. Fortunate that I could get that many interviews since my resume looks decent but my social skills kills me in doing well enough in interviews. I feel terrible when I compare myself to those who are more accomplished and doing better at life than me but then I feel guilty when I compare myself to those who have even less than me such as people who make much less money or those who are still single and alone. It makes me think about how why I feel I deserve more than them and why don&amp;#39;t they deserve what I currently have? I hate feeling ungrateful about life. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am Christian so I believe in God and heaven. I know some people would say if you commit suicide, you&amp;#39;re going to hell and others would say it depends and one mistake or sin in your life shouldn&amp;#39;t define your life. I believe in the latter because you don&amp;#39;t really know everything someones been through and maybe they didn&amp;#39;t get the help they needed or feel they can&amp;#39;t handle what they&amp;#39;re going through anymore when they decided to take their life. For those who believe in God, you can debate all you want but in the end only God gets to decide. &lt;/p&gt;

,SuicideWatch,"I'm sorry but my post might be all over the place. I grew up with an abusive father who used to beat me, but my father was always kind to my younger brother (3 years younger). When I turned 8 years old my father abandoned my family for another woman. My mother joined a church for emotional support and since then I was raised in a super religious upbringing.

This church turned out to be a cult. We had to distance from friends and family. They shamed people for having sex before marriage. They hammered the idea into out heads that planet earth was overrun by spiritual demons, they are in our rooms and everywhere, and we should avoid sin because we will go to hell. And they went really far to make us literally fear going hell every single moment. They would make us envision hell, make us watch documentaries of people that went to hell, show us paintings of hell. Taught us to fast (not eat) often as it would bring us closer to God. We weren’t allowed to watch movies, tv or cartoons/anime or listen to music (unless they were Christian), read non-christian books, comics, etc. Encourage parents/kids to not join school activities like sports, clubs, school dances because they have temptations of sins. The church also encourages us to not go to college because college is a place of sin and to devote our lives to the church after high school and get regular jobs.

Before I knew it my mom and myself became indoctrinated. I was already a loser in school growing up but now I was an even bigger loser because now I was the annoying Christian kid preaching to everyone. My brother didn’t buy the church stuff, he rebelled against my mother's teachings, and he ended up reconnecting with my dad and moving in with my dad. My dad didn’t want anything to do with me, he only wanted my brother. My dad said I'm the son he never wanted. My brother went on to become popular at his school, normal dating life, and eventually went to college.

After I graduated high school, I devoted my life to the church. I got a job at a factory and became a youth leader at my church. When I was 19 I started to become close friends with this girl at my church. Eventually, we started dating and we dated for 6 years. We never had sex, and barely kissed, the most we did was handhold or cuddle. When I was 25 years old I started to have doubts about my religion, and I ended up leaving my church, since then I am no longer religious, or agnostic-atheist. My GF at the time broke up with me for leaving the church, she eventually ended up marrying a guy. Around the same time, I lost my job at the factory and have been unemployed ever since.

Since then I had a hard time adjusting to a normal life. I never went to college or had a dream of my own because of the church. I never got to have friends, go to school dances, or date like a normal person, before church made me feel so ashamed of my sexuality. I was so scared of hell and demons, I even tried not to think dirty, I was supposed to even control my thoughts until marriage. I barely masturbated, I only masturbated a handful of times as a teen, and I haven’t masturbated again till I was 25 and I still feel guilty when I masturbate.

Now I’m a 26-year-old virgin, with daddy issues who never went to college, don’t have social skills, barely any money, and no friends at all. I barely have a personality of my own because for so many years I have lived for the church and my religion. With a bad personality like mine it’s already a set back in dating, and on top of that dating is already hard enough because I’m not attractive by society standards for males. I’m 5’5 with an unattractive face and I'm balding, I would have probably been 5’11 but the doctor told me fasting so often in my teen years stunted my growth and affected my facial bone development. I mean even my Ex-Gf said to me that she would have never been attracted to me if she wasn’t part of our church but that the churches teaching allowed her to see past my looks.

So these days, I get rejected a lot, both in-person and online dating for my personality, looks or height or social status or balding, and even the few times I got lucky and a few girls who were willing to give me a chance, the moment they found out I was a virgin they just assumed something was wrong with me and shamed me for being a virgin. I spend so many years being scared of sex I would not even know how to have sex with a girl.

I just feel like I have nothing to start with. I feel like I wasted my youth, wasted my time when I could have got a head start at college, never had a dream, never had a normal childhood. Now I struggle with being a 26-year-old virgin. Recently I even gained weight, I started eating emotionally because I'm avoiding drinking or using drugs and now I'm fat. I'm also dealing with health issues that make me feel testicular and groin pain and my knees hurt which makes me unable to walk for long, and doctors can't diagnose what's wrong with me. 

I just feel the hope keeps getting deeper. When I compare my life to my brother's life who’s the same age as me, I envy him. He’s 5’11, healthy, handsome, divorced parents but still has our dad in his life, was popular in school, played sports, went to school dances, always knew what he wanted to be, graduated and went to college, had a healthy sex/dating life, never had to deal with religion and had the freedom to find himself. My brother and my mom don’t understand my feelings, and my father doesn’t care about me. When I'm around my brother I feel so much envy and emasculated, I feel like I'm less of a man.

I feel I have everything going against me, and I lost so much of my youth and have nothing to start with, and feel romantically lonely and unattractive. I honestly feel like killing myself. I thought about selling all my stuff and donating all my money to a children's charity in my area and then killing myself. I'm not religious, but I sometimes hope I can be reborn into a different life.

,SuicideWatch,"lately I've been reading about how to cope with thoughts of suicide.

I've been suicidal for months (and not for the first time in my life) and I think about killing myself every day. I've made plans but I'm afraid to follow through.

I came across the concept of ""chronic suicidal thoughts."" one thing that kept coming up in articles and blog posts: that it's not an emergency or a crisis if someone has chronic suicidal thoughts. if someone tells you they're experiencing such thoughts, you shouldn't worry because it's just how they are.

suicidal ideation is only a crisis if it's a one-off or acute, sudden desire that just needs to be managed for a little while until it goes away.

the rest of us - people who have suicidal thoughts for months or years - are just supposed to live with it until eventually it kills us, because ""it's not an emergency.""

the articles and posts kept reiterating that suicidal thoughts are ""a comfort"" or ""a coping mechanism"" for people who have them chronically, because they like the idea of just being able to tap out eventually.

but... this isn't a comfort to me. I don't like thinking about suicide every day. I don't like planning how I can kill myself, how to leave instructions anything that needs taken care of, etc.

I don't want to kill myself the way someone wants to take a vacation.

I want to kill myself the way an animal wants to chew off its own leg to escape a trap.

it's not comforting. it's agonizing. I don't want to feel like this or have these thoughts.

but ""it's not an emergency."" apparently it's not a crisis or anything to worry about until I'm hours away from carrying out my plan or actively doing it.

by the time I reach that point, it'll be too late.

but until I reach that point, there's no help for me.

&lt;p&gt;the articles and posts kept reiterating that suicidal thoughts are &amp;quot;a comfort&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;a coping mechanism&amp;quot; for people who have them chronically, because they like the idea of just being able to tap out eventually.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;but... this isn&amp;#39;t a comfort to me. I don&amp;#39;t like thinking about suicide every day. I don&amp;#39;t like planning how I can kill myself, how to leave instructions anything that needs taken care of, etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#39;t want to kill myself the way someone wants to take a vacation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I want to kill myself the way an animal wants to chew off its own leg to escape a trap.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;it&amp;#39;s not comforting. it&amp;#39;s agonizing. I don&amp;#39;t want to feel like this or have these thoughts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;but &amp;quot;it&amp;#39;s not an emergency.&amp;quot; apparently it&amp;#39;s not a crisis or anything to worry about until I&amp;#39;m hours away from carrying out my plan or actively doing it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;by the time I reach that point, it&amp;#39;ll be too late.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;but until I reach that point, there&amp;#39;s no help for me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I can&amp;#39;t even be suicidal correctly. I don&amp;#39;t know what to do.&lt;/p&gt;

,SuicideWatch,"I should point out that this is all strictly referring to my own depression. It's very probable that other people's depression is more treatable and lives more likely to be fulfilling than my own. 

------------

David Foster Wallace said ""The so-called ‘psychotically depressed’ person who tries to kill herself doesn’t do so out of quote ‘hopelessness’ or any abstract conviction that life’s assets and debits do not square."" But DFW never met me. 

It's a fairly simple idea, I think. Getting better is hard, and requires constant upkeep. That is, of course, assuming it is possible to get better at all. I've tried numerous pills from all major modern anti-depressant families, plus an atypical anti-psychotic. When you've taken that many, it's not likely that the solution lies in any current pill. If I did try again though, next on the docket would likely be one last shot at an SSRI. If that didn't work the next step would be MAOI's and ECT, neither of which I'd do, the cure being worse than the disease. After that it's pretty much ketamine, which I can't afford.

But, supposing that I did, in fact, luck out and find the miracle combination of pills. For starters, there'd be the question of side effects. Most likely some weight gain and sexual dysfunction. Liveable, annoying but liveable. Still, pills alone likely wouldn't be enough to really spin my life around so I'd need to further improve my diet and exercise (I've already upped in my attempts to fight depression on my own, to no avail. Still, I prefer to be skinny rather than not so keep at it.) and likely see a therapist. Nothing I particularly enjoy, and to be honest doubt I would even if medication helped my depression a great deal. I just don't particularly care for exercise and such.

Speaking of not particularly caring; the next thing would be employment. I'm currently unemployed now, collecting disability. I don't particularly mind being a leech, but it's probably not great for me, mentally. Alright, well I'm really only qualified for unskilled labor positions. God I hate them, and I sincerely doubt that even curing my depression would make me enjoy it. Coming into work everyday being paid peanuts to deal with people and having know-nothing bosses worried about the bottom line of a company that literally doesn't know they exist. No, I don't think I could handle that.

But ultimately, where else could I go? Even if I did go back to college, I have no passion and no particular desire to do any kind of work that requires a college degree. The closest thing I have to a passion is video games. So, just for the sake of argument, let's suppose that curing my depression gives me some passion and I follow my childhood dream of becoming a game designer of some description, getting my degree in either graphic design or digital arts or programming or whatever else. Ok great. Time to join the literal worst job industry on the planet, with 80 hour work weeks, no unions, and low wages. Sounds like fun.

Well, if option A is back to college and option B is no college and unskilled labor, I guess I could always go with option B, skilled labor. Of course, if have to support myself with an unskilled labor job while I get my certifications. OK, trade school is cheap, jobs are plentiful, pay us pretty good and well protected... But even still, just the very nature of work itself seems to vex me. 40 hours a week doing tasks I don't care about for people I don't care about with co-workers I don't care about. I don't believe this is caused by the depression, I've been pretty apathetic since I was a kid, but I acknowledge it could be.

OK, so, let's assume I choose option B and I find the work acceptable. Now my options are thus: do I want to be deeply lonely and not get a girlfriend, or try and play the annoying social game of trying to find and keep a girlfriend. Both have their benefits and draw backs but honestly I don't know if I'd call either option preferred. Unless I got a girlfriend and she was really great, in which case it would probably be worth it. Still, this seems unlikely.

Then, there is simply the mere act of existing. Maintaining my life to the best of my ability. Keeping those around me happy. Being social. Watching my family grow old and die. Having to deal with people and things I do like. Of course, with my depression cured there will be good times too. Things I'll enjoy. Moments of happiness.

But, from my current position, I don't think those moments are worth it. They don't seem to outweigh the baggage. That is even assuming the statically best possible scenario. A scenario that, as I've pointed out is pretty unlikely in the first place. The numbers just don't add up in life's collum. 60 years of an average life just doesn't seem worth living. 60 years of this life, certainly not.",t2_6k9s3o9f,False,,0,False,I genuinely don't think that it's even worth it to try and get better anymore.,[],r/SuicideWatch,False,0,,0,,False,t3_h0xmcx,False,dark,1.0,,public,11,0,{},,False,[],,False,False,,{},,False,11,,False,,False,,[],{},,True,,1591904083.0,text,0,,,text,self.SuicideWatch,False,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;I should point out that this is all strictly referring to my own depression.

No, I don&amp;#39;t think I could handle that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But ultimately, where else could I go? Even if I did go back to college, I have no passion and no particular desire to do any kind of work that requires a college degree. The closest thing I have to a passion is video games. So, just for the sake of argument, let&amp;#39;s suppose that curing my depression gives me some passion and I follow my childhood dream of becoming a game designer of some description, getting my degree in either graphic design or digital arts or programming or whatever else. Ok great. Time to join the literal worst job industry on the planet, with 80 hour work weeks, no unions, and low wages. Sounds like fun.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well, if option A is back to college and option B is no college and unskilled labor, I guess I could always go with option B, skilled labor. Of course, if have to support myself with an unskilled labor job while I get my certifications. OK, trade school is cheap, jobs are plentiful, pay us pretty good and well protected... But even still, just the very nature of work itself seems to vex me. 40 hours a week doing tasks I don&amp;#39;t care about for people I don&amp;#39;t care about with co-workers I don&amp;#39;t care about. I don&amp;#39;t believe this is caused by the depression, I&amp;#39;ve been pretty apathetic since I was a kid, but I acknowledge it could be.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;OK, so, let&amp;#39;s assume I choose option B and I find the work acceptable. Now my options are thus: do I want to be deeply lonely and not get a girlfriend, or try and play the annoying social game of trying to find and keep a girlfriend. Both have their benefits and draw backs but honestly I don&amp;#39;t know if I&amp;#39;d call either option preferred. Unless I got a girlfriend and she was really great, in which case it would probably be worth it. Still, this seems unlikely.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then, there is simply the mere act of existing. Maintaining my life to the best of my ability. Keeping those around me happy. Being social. Watching my family grow old and die. Having to deal with people and things I do like. Of course, with my depression cured there will be good times too. Things I&amp;#39;ll enjoy. Moments of happiness.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But, from my current position, I don&amp;#39;t think those moments are worth it. They don&amp;#39;t seem to outweigh the baggage. That is even assuming the statically best possible scenario. A scenario that, as I&amp;#39;ve pointed out is pretty unlikely in the first place. The numbers just don&amp;#39;t add up in life&amp;#39;s collum. 60 years of an average life just doesn&amp;#39;t seem worth living. 60 years of this life, certainly not.&lt;/p&gt;

&amp;#x200B;

I am not sure if everyone has these thoughts, maybe everyone wishes they weren't here on the inside. Either way, I am looking for advice. 

&amp;#x200B;

I have been thinking about suicide for a year now and I need it to stop. I feel this way because of school mainly, my mum is a doctor so obviously there is lots of academic pressure, she got 12 As in her GCSEs and 4 A\* in A levels and I often think to myself that there is no way I can possibly live up to her in any way, this resulted in me putting myself under lots of pressure to succeed in exams, often not letting myself eat if I got below a C, and to be fair to myself, I did see results, but at the cost of my mental health.

Furthermore, my house doesn't have any farther figure because he left a few years ago to start a new life in Australia and after reading the studies I concluded that this plays a large part in these feelings. School feels as tho it is slowly eating away at me. My school utilizes the cruel practice of 'streaming' which is the idea that students should be grouped tother based on academic performance, with little regard for the well-being of the students who will be labeled as at the 'bottom'. It is hard to be motivated to wake up 5 days a week to go to school, knowing that you are at the bottom. A dunce. 

In a world where anyone can be anything, it seems diabolical that such a dystopian system can be put into practice while being unscrutinized. The schooling system in the U.K is not only cruel but dehumanizing particularly to those who may under-perform. 

As many may know, right now is exam season in the U.K, which has led to me having these dark thoughts in record numbers, and I am scared that one day, I might just crack under the pressure and end it all. But at least for now, I recognize that it would be a foolish thing to do.

If I am complaining about nothing (Which there is a high chance I am), just tell me to stop complaining and shut the f\*\*\* up. But I still need advice on how I can exit this dead-end of destructive thoughts and mannerisms before its to late to turn back. 

My final thought concludes that we all have people and things to live for, amazing memories that deserve to be remembered for years to come and new experiences that no matter your current situation, will happen one day soon. We just need to be reminded of that sometimes. Which is why I turn to you.

,SuicideWatch," Hi I am 39 years old I am tired of living through life like this I'm on disability the unable to work because of PTSD severe chronic depression severe social anxiety which makes working nearly impossible to be around others and just to be able to try to do a job I also have dyslexia and learning issues which make working even harder especially if it's something I've never done before. Companies don’t want someone who is really slow at trying to learn and who has no education.

I have a tooth that needs to be recrowned and its the #19 tooth, I had the #30 tooth same spot on the right side removed and if I get #19 removed, I won't be able to chew as it is the only tooth I have I can really chomp down on food and yet I can't afford the $1200 for a new crown on it so I have no option but to get it removed for $400 

I have spent show years trying to get my GED, and I have spent many years trying to get a job my own place a vehicle and a good woman to love me. I have lost my parents when I was in my early twenties I only knew my dad for a few months before he passed away when I was 23, when I was 25 I lost my mother I don't know if it was from suicide or if it was from health issues.

I have no family no friends, what can we do have they don't want anything to do with me or I don't want anything to do with them because of how toxic they are to me. I have spent many years homeless and have been through a lot of stuff and seeing things nobody should see. I am currently renting a room from a sixty-year-old woman and if she dies I will end up back on the streets.

I have been trying to find a place to live I've been called up for several apartments low income, but every time it comes time for me to take one something comes up that keeps me from being able to get into one. I bought a car a few years ago and got scammed out of $2,000 to USD. I've been trying to save for another car but every time I do something comes up that takes my savings  or pushes me further in debt.

For the past 10 years I have applied for jobs never had an interview, I have spent trying to get my GED  and have been unable to. I've had tutors I've had teachers,  I have had study groups and one-on-one sessions. but even with all of this I have not been able to get my GED my education is on a second and third-grade level in almost every subject and I have to learn from 2nd grade to 12th grade I can't do that.

I spend my time watching movies, TV shows, listening to music, I don't even have a game system so I can't even play video games which I actually used to enjoy doing. It's been years since I've played a video game I can't afford the consoles or the games. and the computer I have is not strong enough to be able to hold video games or to be able to handle playing video games.

I used to enjoy fishing camping used to enjoy archery, I even used to go bowling every other Friday night which I can't do anymore either. I even used to love going to the golf courses and hitting up the golf ranges and just shooting a bucket of golf balls I found it peaceful and relaxing but I can't even afford that. 

I have done many things for work which was cash under the table and it was all manual labor. I have done everything from fixing fences building concrete slabs building porches building staircases as well as building walls and fixing holes in the walls even putting in new flooring or replacing flooring. I have done many other things as well as boxing for a few months I drove a semi-truck for a few months but my anxiety gets so bad to the point I could even drive them anymore. I can't do the work I used to do because of arthritis in my lower back and rheumatoid arthritis in my knees and feet.

I consider myself weird and nerdy by I consider myself a homebody but I do like going out time to time that prefers to stay home. I have put myself out there in the dating scene for over 8 years, during those eight years I've had women catfish me pretending to want to be with me, leading me on as they loved me. then they would fake their death on me or they would just ghost me. I have had women telling me I was a joke worthless useless had nothing to offer a relationship and I shouldn't even be loved and no one would want to be with me.

I have been trying to build myself a life and been trying to get on my feet but every time I do things come up that keep me down and knock me back down and I just can't keep doing it anymore. it feels like every breath I take is just razors cutting through my lungs attracting me apart inside. I am tired of struggling to breathe. I am tired of trying to fight to build something out of my life. I am tired of spending every waking moment of my life alone single unloved unwanted.

All I wanted was to find a woman to love me and accept me and treat me right. I don't ask for much just a simple life, all I want is just one or two friends a nice woman my own apartment and a vehicle that's it. but it feels like I'm trying to reach to live on Pluto and it's like it's trying to ask for a billion dollars and to become the president of the whole world.

I am tired I am worn out I am exhausted I have nothing left in me to give nothing left in me to fight I can't do it by myself anymore alone no support no one helping me constantly fighting and fighting and getting nowhere except right where I was when I started to try to fight to build something I can't do it anymore so today when a woman that I rent bedroom from leaves I will end up ending my life.

&lt;p&gt;I have been trying to find a place to live I&amp;#39;ve been called up for several apartments low income, but every time it comes time for me to take one something comes up that keeps me from being able to get into one. I bought a car a few years ago and got scammed out of $2,000 to USD. I&amp;#39;ve been trying to save for another car but every time I do something comes up that takes my savings  or pushes me further in debt.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the past 10 years I have applied for jobs never had an interview, I have spent trying to get my GED  and have been unable to. I&amp;#39;ve had tutors I&amp;#39;ve had teachers,  I have had study groups and one-on-one sessions. but even with all of this I have not been able to get my GED my education is on a second and third-grade level in almost every subject and I have to learn from 2nd grade to 12th grade I can&amp;#39;t do that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I spend my time watching movies, TV shows, listening to music, I don&amp;#39;t even have a game system so I can&amp;#39;t even play video games which I actually used to enjoy doing. It&amp;#39;s been years since I&amp;#39;ve played a video game I can&amp;#39;t afford the consoles or the games. and the computer I have is not strong enough to be able to hold video games or to be able to handle playing video games.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I used to enjoy fishing camping used to enjoy archery, I even used to go bowling every other Friday night which I can&amp;#39;t do anymore either. I even used to love going to the golf courses and hitting up the golf ranges and just shooting a bucket of golf balls I found it peaceful and relaxing but I can&amp;#39;t even afford that. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have done many things for work which was cash under the table and it was all manual labor. I have done everything from fixing fences building concrete slabs building porches building staircases as well as building walls and fixing holes in the walls even putting in new flooring or replacing flooring. I have done many other things as well as boxing for a few months I drove a semi-truck for a few months but my anxiety gets so bad to the point I could even drive them anymore. I can&amp;#39;t do the work I used to do because of arthritis in my lower back and rheumatoid arthritis in my knees and feet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I consider myself weird and nerdy by I consider myself a homebody but I do like going out time to time that prefers to stay home. I have put myself out there in the dating scene for over 8 years, during those eight years I&amp;#39;ve had women catfish me pretending to want to be with me, leading me on as they loved me. then they would fake their death on me or they would just ghost me. I have had women telling me I was a joke worthless useless had nothing to offer a relationship and I shouldn&amp;#39;t even be loved and no one would want to be with me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have been trying to build myself a life and been trying to get on my feet but every time I do things come up that keep me down and knock me back down and I just can&amp;#39;t keep doing it anymore. it feels like every breath I take is just razors cutting through my lungs attracting me apart inside. I am tired of struggling to breathe. I am tired of trying to fight to build something out of my life. I am tired of spending every waking moment of my life alone single unloved unwanted.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All I wanted was to find a woman to love me and accept me and treat me right. I don&amp;#39;t ask for much just a simple life, all I want is just one or two friends a nice woman my own apartment and a vehicle that&amp;#39;s it. but it feels like I&amp;#39;m trying to reach to live on Pluto and it&amp;#39;s like it&amp;#39;s trying to ask for a billion dollars and to become the president of the whole world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am tired I am worn out I am exhausted I have nothing left in me to give nothing left in me to fight I can&amp;#39;t do it by myself anymore alone no support no one helping me constantly fighting and fighting and getting nowhere except right where I was when I started to try to fight to build something I can&amp;#39;t do it anymore so today when a woman that I rent bedroom from leaves I will end up ending my life.  I just have nothing left to live for and nothing left to do and nothing left in me.&lt;/p&gt;

,SuicideWatch,"Introduction: I have ***NEVER, EVER*** attempted suicide my whole life *(and I won't ever seriously consider actually attempting it)*, **BUT** suicidal thoughts will be triggered in me whenever I'm faced with major event milestones that cause stress. Sometimes I wish I want to live forever thanks to the existence of good things (for me, it's games, music and some YouTube channels plus good memories), but when bad things get ""overwhelming"" (e.g. stress of coping from no school to kindergarten, kindergarten to primary/elementary, high school to university, and in a few years, university to working life, not to mention increasing responsibilities in the family AAAGH) I wish I was dead earlier even before I experienced the suffering.

Now, to the points of the title. I'm sure absolutely nobody wants stress, right? But guess what, it's been drilled into us in regular doses with virtually no break from it. Let's start from childhood: People who can afford school got forcibly sent into school and they wish they could just stay at home or go to fun places and just relax like it's the holiday breaks. What about the people who couldn't afford school and just stayed at home everyday? They had to do household chores or help in the family business. School's got peer and academic and maybe familial pressure too, while household chores would probably contain a very intense amount of familial pressure, idk because I'm never been *that* broke, maybe I should watch more documentaries about uneducated peasant life. But anyway, even though the activities are totally different, both are stressful. ***Either way, stress is inevitable.*** But then you also have nice privileges such as lots of playtime, mischievous moments and pranks, as well as a sense of wonder and awe towards the world!

Fast forward to teenagehood, you get things like stress and confusion from puberty, peer pressure, family pressure, societal pressure, academic pressure... It's all stress and pressure. Imagine a life without stress/pressure-- Wait, that's impossible! *But even so, wouldn't it be nice to experience a purely positive life sheltered from stress?* ***Wait, nope, too late, never possible.*** But then you also experience nice feelings such as falling in love, the ability to finally go out yourself (but still with parental (dis)approval, usually), the maturity for more difficult hobbies/skills and appreciation of deeper media.

And speaking of adulthood, you now bear a LOT more responsibilities including college/university, bill payment, a full-time workload, and if applicable, taking care of your partner and/or children and making sure that they also get an upbringing that isn't all free from any form of stress, because apparently *(read: unfortunately)* [life *isn't* supposed to be a nice easy pure utopia.](https://thoughtcatalog.com/lauren-jarvis-gibson/2017/01/life-isnt-meant-to-be-easy-and-if-it-is-then-youre-doing-it-wrong/) Boo. ***Nobody's free from stress!*** (Tons of other articles about why life isn't easy also say pretty much the same thing.)

,SuicideWatch,"Suicide was a concept that came early to me. Whenever my mom wanted something she couldn’t get, she’d threaten to kill herself. This led to my father marrying her and divorcing her in the long run. 

Ever since I was 9, I constantly wished I was never born. I still do. I see no way my existence has made it better for anyone but one person. If this one person never became such a good friend of mine I probably would’ve been dead a long time ago. But he’s moving to New York in a few months (I live in Oregon) but even then we’ll probably still be talking a lot. 

I guess what I’m saying is that my life has only positively affected one person. If I was never born, my family’s lives would be so much better. My brother might’ve been a functioning person in society. My dad wouldn’t be so stressed, wouldn’t have heart problems. My mom wouldn’t have to live her life knowing that her “daughter” that she’s always wanted is a transgender excuse of a 5’2 man. 

I feel like I’m not worthy of anything. Of love, of friends, even something as insignificant as my tv. This is largely because of my body. I feel so small. Physically and mentally. I feel like a waste of space. I’m weak. I have no power over myself. I have stretch marks on my hips because there’s so much fat on them. My hands are so small that I can hardly even hold a dodgeball or hold a controller right. 

And most of all, I don’t even know if I’m a man. I feel like it’s who I am but with the way that everyone clearly views me, I feel like I can never see myself for who I am. Even just the fact that I’m already this far in my transition makes me sick. I hate being transgender. But it’s significantly less painful than the thought that I would be stuck living as a girl forever. Still, I hate that I’ve had to resort to this. 

People claim they’re supportive, and I’m grateful, but they’re also honest. Only when I’m alone I feel the most like myself. But when someone else sees me, it’s beyond obvious that I’m not, nor never will be, born male. 

Even just me saying this makes me feel worse. I know that I’ll always be small. I know that no matter how many things I change, I’ll have always been born in a female body. 

Now comes to my final point. The discomfort I’ve felt for so long has never gone away. Physical discomfort translates into mental discomfort. Too many things to list affect me every single day. 

Discomfort is something everyone gets. But when it’s every minute of every day, constantly occupying my mind, it becomes unbearable to the point of pure hopelessness that I’ll never be liberated, then to the thought that suicide is the way out. 

I’m not depressed anymore. I was from age 9 to 14. But I can’t tell if I’m happy. I tell myself that I am but I feel like I’m lying. 

I see a lot of potential in myself. I’ve always been an artist and I really want to get into game development. I can see myself taking that path. But I also easily see myself failing. I have a list of things I need to do before I die. The first on the list is to see whether or not I fail or pass. Then from there, the list continues into personal projects.

Nope I wish i could go back and beat myself for being so fucking stupid.&lt;/p&gt;

,SuicideWatch,"I've struggled with anxiety, depression, and suicidal thoughts for nearly my entire life. I was doing relatively well for a short amount of time, but then around Christmas last year, I took a nosedive and became the most messed up I had been in years. I cried constantly, reverted to constantly thinking about killing myself, the works. It got so bad that I started neglecting my college work and skipping out on classes because I couldn't pull myself out of bed.

&amp;#x200B;

I ended up signing up for counseling at school and didn't have any insurance to see an actual therapist. I had all of 3 sessions before the whole coronavirus thing hit. I didn't get to talk to my counselor anymore because everything shut down for a while and classes moved online. I ultimately had to drop out of school for the spring semester because my classwork was too far gone. The pandemic has been absolute hell on my anxiety disorder. I still fight with panic attacks any time I have to leave my house.

&amp;#x200B;

I have a muscular injury that prevents me from standing for more than 20-30 minutes at a time or else I can't walk without extreme pain. I don't have a job right now because of this so I've basically been sitting at home since mid-December while my mental state has crumbled to basically nothing. My partner has done all the work and I've just sat around siphoning off of her like a fucking parasite. I don't know why she puts up with me or how she could still love me after how royally I've screwed us. She's the only good thing I really have and I don't deserve her.

&amp;#x200B;

We were told this past weekend that we were going to lose our house. The tl;dr of it is that it is situated on the same property as the landlords' home, and they informed us that they needed the house for their own family reasons. We have 30 days to pack up and get out, give or take. They were nice about it and all and even wrote us a letter of recommendation because we've never been late on rent and aren't bad tenants, but that doesn't change how bad of a position they've put us in.

&amp;#x200B;

Our credit is shit and we have no money. There are no other rental properties in the area that we could move into on such short notice, and even if there were, I don't think anyone is going to take us in with how terrible our credit scores are (both are below 500 right now). My parents have told me that I can crash with them until we find another place, but my partner is not welcome since they are pretty homophobic. I don't think living with them again will be very good for my mental state. It was hell living with them before and even though they've gotten better over the years and continue to improve, I still don't know if I'll be able to handle being back under the same roof as them. My partner's family's house is already packed to the max but they may have a room opening up soon since her brother just joined the army and is supposed to be shipping out to boot camp in August. I don't really want to be a burden on them though and even though they like me and support our relationship, I'm not sure if I would be allowed to stay with them in addition to my partner. I certainly don't feel comfortable inviting myself, especially since I don't really have a way to contribute to the household.

&amp;#x200B;

I feel like the walls are closing in on me and that it would just be better to give in and kill myself. I'm almost 29 years old and my life hasn't amounted to anything but crippling debt and constant mental anguish. I haven't slept properly in months. I feel like I'm just dragging my partner down with me and that she deserves so much better. My family deserves a better daughter than the shitty one that I've turned out to be. I've been fighting to continue life for over 10 years now and I'm so tired. I don't know why I keep fighting it. I don't know why I keep managing to cling onto life when doing myself in would just fix everything. Pragmatically speaking, I feel like I should just pull the trigger and get it over with.

&amp;#x200B;

The biggest problem is that even in death, I'd still just be a big burden on everyone I care about. I don't want my partner to come home and find my brains splattered all over the place. She doesn't deserve that. She's already going through enough. I scared her yesterday because I had a bad breakdown and didn't respond to her messages while she was at work. I don't want to burden her or my family with the outrageous costs for a funeral/burial, either.

,SuicideWatch,"Typo: Financial situation

TL;DR: Persistent inflation in my country is ruining my life and leaving me desperate even though I ""technically"" shouldn't be in this shit.

I've been dealing with a lot of shit in the last few years and I've managed to handle it to some extent, but now I see every little possible hope around me dying and that's the worst...

It all comes to fucking inflation, something that I don't have the slightest control over. You go to bed thinking ""okay if I work for 4 months then I can somehow manage to change my broken phone or do X"" and then suddenly wake up the next day (well more like a few months than days in reality as we're still a bit far from hyperinflation) with prices doubled...

I've been a good student, going to to best middle/high-school in my city, graduating the best university in my country as a rank 1 student, and now accepted in a kinda high-on-demand and more applicable field for my masters in the same uni also knowing 4 languages. My family is considered upper middle class (by here's standards of course) and I'm an only child with both parents working (I also take some part-time job plus some small scholarships here and there) YET I can't fucking spend a day without having to worry about money... All of my devices which I need for studying/work are starting to break all at once and I won't even be able to buy a damn mid-range phone let alone something better. Like buying a 2k PC here means having to spend all you earn as a university PROFESSOR for 5 fucking months. And that would be only if your fucking currency won't lose much more of its value... And it's not all about those fancy foreign products I even have to worry about food and cloths these days...

Funny thing is that back when I was in middle school I could afford a high-end phone just by saving for like a year...

I see no fucking light here, I mean sure I can afford food and shelter still but the thing is that things just keep getting worse and it's just a matter of time before I can afford any of those... And well being from a shitty country moving out would also be hell of an experience considering everyone else is also trying to do the same...

I have no hope for anything anymore, I just wanted to have a simple life attending to my hobbies and research without having to worry about all this shit but I guess that's a mere dream... I just want to get rid of this stress-driven uncertain life, and there ain't many options for that...

&lt;p&gt;TL;DR: Persistent inflation in my country is ruining my life and leaving me desperate even though I &amp;quot;technically&amp;quot; shouldn&amp;#39;t be in this shit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve been dealing with a lot of shit in the last few years and I&amp;#39;ve managed to handle it to some extent, but now I see every little possible hope around me dying and that&amp;#39;s the worst...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It all comes to fucking inflation, something that I don&amp;#39;t have the slightest control over. You go to bed thinking &amp;quot;okay if I work for 4 months then I can somehow manage to change my broken phone or do X&amp;quot; and then suddenly wake up the next day (well more like a few months than days in reality as we&amp;#39;re still a bit far from hyperinflation) with prices doubled...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve been a good student, going to to best middle/high-school in my city, graduating the best university in my country as a rank 1 student, and now accepted in a kinda high-on-demand and more applicable field for my masters in the same uni also knowing 4 languages. My family is considered upper middle class (by here&amp;#39;s standards of course) and I&amp;#39;m an only child with both parents working (I also take some part-time job plus some small scholarships here and there) YET I can&amp;#39;t fucking spend a day without having to worry about money... All of my devices which I need for studying/work are starting to break all at once and I won&amp;#39;t even be able to buy a damn mid-range phone let alone something better. Like buying a 2k PC here means having to spend all you earn as a university PROFESSOR for 5 fucking months. And that would be only if your fucking currency won&amp;#39;t lose much more of its value... And it&amp;#39;s not all about those fancy foreign products I even have to worry about food and cloths these days...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Funny thing is that back when I was in middle school I could afford a high-end phone just by saving for like a year...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I see no fucking light here, I mean sure I can afford food and shelter still but the thing is that things just keep getting worse and it&amp;#39;s just a matter of time before I can afford any of those... And well being from a shitty country moving out would also be hell of an experience considering everyone else is also trying to do the same... Not to mention it will need loads of money which is almost impossible to pay due to this low value currency...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have no hope for anything anymore, I just wanted to have a simple life attending to my hobbies and research without having to worry about all this shit but I guess that&amp;#39;s a mere dream... I just want to get rid of this stress-driven uncertain life, and there ain&amp;#39;t many options for that...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I just don&amp;#39;t know how so many people that are worse off than me go on living...&lt;/p&gt;

Daycare hasn’t reopened and has no plans to reopen, but is still charging $75 a week to *not* teach or watch any kids.  

Spouse isn’t going to take any time off of work to give me even a one-hour break, and is going back to the office the *second* it reopens.  “I need this,” they told me.  “It’s for my mental health.  I just can’t stay at this house any longer.”

Looking for work is still impossible because there is no one to take care of the kid, and Spouse continues to sabotage the job search.  “Of course I can watch the kid” so I can do an interview becomes “I have a meeting” ten minutes before the call is scheduled.

Watching the kid isn’t going to get any easier.  Months and months and months of tantrums, of failed potty training, of screaming sleepless nights, of being called too fat and stupid to parent by everyone at the pediatrician’s office, of being coughed and sneezed and pissed and shat on, of having meals I prepared rejected and thrown across the room by two stupid assholes (only one of whom has the excuse of being under three) who refuse to eat it or anything else but complain that they’re still hungry.  No daycare, no breaks.  24 hours a day, 7 days a week.

And I ever complain about this, to anyone I know?  Then they remind me that I’m the asshole for complaining.  Because I don’t have a job.  Because I’m a leech.  Because I’m a breeder.  Because I don’t have enough kids.  Because I don’t like being a parent.  Because I don’t know how easy I have it. Because they have it worse.  Because other people have it worse.

I see the mods have removed me standing up for myself in the face of an admitted troll, so here’s my takeaway.

Just ... the sheer *gall* it takes to read about four discrete instances of Spouse sabotaging my attempts to find literally any job—to the point where they poured paint over my interview suits and blamed it on a toddler who did not have access to any paint and could not have climbed that high in the closet—and then turn around and *take Spouse’s side* and call it “tough love” and then constantly demonstrate exactly the kind of abuse I get whenever I try to open up about my life and my feelings ...

im 19,

my parents are divorced, my grandparents own my college fund account, they didn't pay my summer tuition because they side with their son (my dad), my college is kicking me out of a class that I've already failed once and just wanted to wipe it all away by tryharding in the summer.. 

I'm a failure at everything I do, I'm good at math but as you see the economy isn't exactly the best place right now; I love to make music but I don't have the money to get it mixed or to buy tunecore or do anything to promote it / earn anything off of it in any way.

My mom doesn't believe in mental health issues; I'm self diagnosed paranoid-schizo. Not like I have the means to verify that; but it seems to emcompass my issues quite well.

I'm alone in this world; my brother steals money from me, my mom enables him to, and my dad is on the other side of the earth too drunk or high to care about anyone he may have known before his 50th birthday. 

I wish I had one opening; one shot. I seem to squander all my relationships because suburb folk aren't like city folk. My number one thing is respect; theirs is reputation; and they have no problem cracking some bones to bolster theirs. 

I have a girlfriend but I feel like she doesn't love me at all; She's always either angry about work or angry about waking up to go to work. I seem more like a journal, sometimes a sex toy to her, but not really a friend. When she starts conversation she expects it back; when I start it I'm met with a blank stare or literal silence followed by 15 seconds later ""huh?"".

im jaded by the whole thing. life in all of its 'glory'. none of it matters; no one is truly selfless; the ones that are will be leaving soon

When I do express myself and how I feel she doesn't listen anyway. No one cares. No one ever will. And I need to accept that. and I will; right after I finish tying this noose. Bye everyone, don't comment because I won't be logging back

,SuicideWatch,"This might sound stupid, but I have had suicide thoughts for a few years. It's been on and off and it's only thoughts, never attempts. I did better recently. I always knew I will never kill myself. I'm a smart person and can control myself in difficult situations.

But then 2 days ago, some miss understanding happen between me and my girlfriend. Without going into details, we quarreled a bit and her phone was off mid quarrel. I was in very bad mood that day as well, so bad timing of the quarrel. My previous girlfriend broke up with me and shut off the phone, leaving me sleepless the whole night.

So my girlfriend didnt break up with me, and it was all just a miss understanding and her phone went legit off due to low battery maybe, but I legit thought she was gone.

I could see me jumping off a cliff and feel the feeling and thoughts while doing it, and the worse thing, it felt RIGHT.

I am better now and all good. The problem is, I am so scared this might happen again. Because it seams like it doesn't matter how clear your mind is, once the suicide thought takes over, it's done.

,SuicideWatch,"Hello, 19yo male here. I know I'm very young, but I don't really see how my life can improve from now on. TLDR: I made a bad decision about my studies, and I don't want to drag a life of regret.

In high school, I was a bright student, but I didn't know what I wanted to do with my life, as I was quite interested in everything. Also, studying, and education in general, was the most important thing to me; playing sports, seeing friends, playing video games: I got tired of it all very quickly, as I was already having so much fun in studying, and I really thought that you have to do well in your studies first to enjoy the other aspects of life (I understand that this is not everyone's vision, I don't impose it). Finally, I chose a selective educational establishment, that aims to prepare students to enter a good school in 2 years (a system specific to my country). But this choice was really fucking hard to make and I had hesitated a lot with another schooling (more science-based).

Got my high school diploma with a perfect grade, then began my schooling in September 2018. In fact, I soon realized, at least unconsciously, that I had little interest in most subjects being taught in the schooling I had chosen (these are subjects that I love to learn on my own, even at a high level, but not in an academic setting; I learnt it the hard way). But since I was a serious student, I didn't ask myself any questions and forced myself to work (also, it's a very intense schooling where you don't have too much time to think about anything else). But during these two years I was less and less efficient; in fact, I never really had the motivation to progress, from the first day, even if I didn't realize it right away, I was a bit like a spectator, behaving mechanically, unconsciously imitating my classmates. Deep down, I didn't care if I scored well or badly on the tests, even if, by lying to myself, I convinced myself that it affected me. I realize more and more that this is probably the other schooling I should have chosen. Useless thing to think about, right? But you don't choose what you think about.

I really feel like I've been a shadow of my former self during these two years and therefore that I've wasted my potential. I feel that I have betrayed myself, betrayed my parents, and all of those who believe in me... Actually, from an external point of view, I'm not doing so badly, I got pretty good grades (but also bad ones), but deep down I know I didn't give it my all, despite my efforts (but ""wanting to want"" is not something you can choose, I guess): it's that self-betrayal feeling that hits the hardest. I feel like I've lost my one true love, my passion for studying... *The higher you rise, the harder you fall*, right?

Now that I am condemned to do something I don't like, I feel empty, numb (I was from the beginning of my schooling, but the period of lockdown allowed me to think a little about myself, a rare thing, and made me realize it), trapped. I guess that's basically how most people live: doing something they don't really like. But I don't see the point. The problem is that there is no turning back, I can't choose the other schooling, and I will never be able to make up for those two years lost in procrastination, lack of ambition, lack of motivation, lack of discipline, lack of smart work (as I've said, I actually worked quite a lot but not as an active man, rather as a zombie, and for example, there's almost nothing in my long-term memory related to this training). Therefore, it is very logical that I have no future, as I'll live as a half-sleeping man. I don't see the point of recovering from a bad decision: what's the point of ""recovering"" if it's to live without energy? Some illnesses just can't be cured, and that's why physicians sometimes decide to turn off their patients' life support...

I won't try anything against myself as long as my parents live, as I don't want to hurt them, but when they die, I'll have nothing left to live for.

,SuicideWatch,I just noticed that my family members are trying to get closer to me for some unknown reasons. I've been avoiding them like plague for the past few months.

,SuicideWatch,"I don’t really understand, I’m writing this from the floor in my bathroom after attempting to slit my wrists, stopped because it hurt too much. I have assessments due tomorrow and for the first time in really forever I’ve stopped panicking and doing them last minute. Every time I get close to killing myself I wake up the next morning, whilst having previously planned it. Not wanting to. I wake up with this want to be happy and then throughout the day it cycles back to me wanting to die severely. 

I don’t understand why? I’ve wanted to die for the past 5 years but something always stops me from going all the way. I have no means of painless death and that’s all I want. It’s strange that my mind understands this but cycles through this reliving pain every day. I don’t want to have a future. I don’t see the point in trying to get happy when I know I never will truly. I just want something to stop this endless torment. I hate that no matter what happens in my life either good or bad, I will never escape this pain. 

I’ve thought about writing a suicide note, but what would I say? How do I explain all my thoughts into a document to all the people I want to say goodbye to? Who would I leave to entrust giving it to everyone that I want to see it? And what if after I send it I fail again anyway? I just really don’t understand life anymore. Why does it keep me alive. Every day it gets worse. My anxiety, my focus, my drive to talk to friends and loved ones. I genuinely just want to drift peacefully so that I will stop worrying every single minute of the day. Even in my dreams I see the people I love disappointed in me, I slowly tear them down with me just trying to explain to them that I need them for support, I tell my best friend that I just want them to speak to me like they care, but I ruin it. The people here. Whoever reads this. I might finally do it one day. Maybe I’ll post again a few times and maybe I’ll post why so people can not make the mistakes I’ve made, not go down this path of torture and be happy. I’ll never understand not worrying all day.

I have assessments due tomorrow and for the first time in really forever I’ve stopped panicking and doing them last minute. Every time I get close to killing myself I wake up the next morning, whilst having previously planned it. Not wanting to. I wake up with this want to be happy and then throughout the day it cycles back to me wanting to die severely. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don’t understand why? I’ve wanted to die for the past 5 years but something always stops me from going all the way. I have no means of painless death and that’s all I want. It’s strange that my mind understands this but cycles through this reliving pain every day. I don’t want to have a future. I don’t see the point in trying to get happy when I know I never will truly. I just want something to stop this endless torment. I hate that no matter what happens in my life either good or bad, I will never escape this pain. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve thought about writing a suicide note, but what would I say? How do I explain all my thoughts into a document to all the people I want to say goodbye to? Who would I leave to entrust giving it to everyone that I want to see it? And what if after I send it I fail again anyway? I just really don’t understand life anymore. Why does it keep me alive. Every day it gets worse. My anxiety, my focus, my drive to talk to friends and loved ones. I genuinely just want to drift peacefully so that I will stop worrying every single minute of the day. Even in my dreams I see the people I love disappointed in me, I slowly tear them down with me just trying to explain to them that I need them for support, I tell my best friend that I just want them to speak to me like they care, but I ruin it. The people here. Whoever reads this. I might finally do it one day. Maybe I’ll post again a few times and maybe I’ll post why so people can not make the mistakes I’ve made, not go down this path of torture and be happy. I’ll never understand not worrying all day.

,SuicideWatch,"Hello everyone, my name is Cedric (suppose it ain't impprtant anymore for me to put my name out here) and I'm from the Netherlands. Currently 28 years old, served in the army and am currently finishing my bachelor in social work :).

The thing is, I've been struggling with severe social anxiety, depression, panic attacks and suicidal thoughts. I also recently became homeless because after I was honorably discharged from the army, I went to school and stayed with my parents. Unfortunately, my conditions were too difficult for my parents to really understand and I really don't blaim them. It escalated and thats when I decided it was best to leave. I'm moving between the homes of my friends. But the title says it all. I'm putting an end to the missery in my head. It sounds drastic, but it's comforting to me that I won't have to deal with all the mess inside my head.
For the people seeking an explanation how it feels to deal with my conditions, I'll do my best to explain. 

First off, the anxiety. Imagine when you have a big test, an important play on stage, or when you have to have a job interview. Those nerves you have are pretty normal and somewhat healthy because it shows you care. It's that feeling of tingling/rollercoaster sensation that creeps up from your belly to your head. Let's take that feeling and apply that to much less important things throughout the day. For example, getting a message on whatsapp from close friends, doing groceries, going to the clothing store, putting something in the dishwasher the right way, walking in public. Almost everything you can imagine that involves other people, I get that sensation in my belly, stomach, chest and throat. You can imagine it's very tiring. 

When I go to sleep, that's when the real fun starts. I have nothing but my own mind to fuck with me and nothing to distract me from my destructive thought patterns. Imagine going to bed and already you feel sick in your stomach because you know you're gonna have panic attacks. My hands become sweaty, my heart starts pounding, I hyperventilate, lose my sense of balance, dissociate myself from reality and have restless muscles. This for about 3-4 times a night. It is an existential feeling of dread I cannot really explain. That feeling when you run up the stairs at home because you think something is going to grab you when you were a little kid. That, and then 100x worse. Again, pretty tiring.

With the combination that I also have sleep apnea, isn't helping my nights rest either. So every morning it feels like I'm strapped to my bed, but as soon as I wake up, the anxiety starts again. It's like: shit! I have to get out now, but I'm so tired! But everyone is counting on me to be there! But what if I am late?! Shit shit shit shit!!!! 

Give or take, I've dealt with that since I was 12 or 13 if I remember correctly. That's a long time being tired. In those years I've had some burn-outs and I don't think I've ever recovered from them. Around when I was 22, depression started kicking in. 

Depression feels like.. well it doesn't feel like anything. You could put me on the most fun trip of my lifetime, but I was just as content with that as laying alone sulking in my bedroom. Depression to me means that you can't feel anything. Nothing matters anymore. On top of that, for me at least, I felt so guilty because I had to lie to my closest ones that I was having fun, but in reality, it didn't do anything for me. I just was so tired and wanted to sleep. Such a long sleep that I didn't have to wake up anymore. I know I'm contradicting myself here a bit, but it's more like, if I ever felt something, it was something negative. Other than that, you're an empty shell walking the earth with the ever ongoing question in your mind: what even is the purpose of my efforts in this life? 

The thing is, I can imagine that my close ones would feel insulted when I say nothing really matters to me. That is an enormous guilt I'm carrying. Also something I cannot deal with anymore.

So, now I'm at wits end. Don't get me wrong, I sought help from professionals and close ones alike! Unfortunately, to no avail. I've had suicidal thoughts for over a year or 4 now, but never really acted on them. I've searched ways to end my life as painless as possible, but then I thought to myself: the hurt I'm inflicting to everyone who cares for me, was enough to stop the act. Right now, it doesn't work anymore. 

I'm sitting on a quiet dike next to the canal of my hometown Middelburg. I'm going to record my final testimonies to every impactfull individual in my life because typing will be a problem at some point. 

Right now, as I'm sitting here, I'm drinking alcohol, taking an overdose of xanax in combination of eating grapefruit because that enhances the effect of the drug. If I go now, it will be in my sleep. I will send parts my coordinates to two different friends who can solve my puzzle. That way, they will find me the next day. 

Reddit has been a great experience to me :). You had the ability to take my mind of things and I am thankfull to you for that! 

I'm sorry if this post hits too close to your own homes, but this way, I hope people can learn from my experience :). 

I will take this thought with me:

Ever since I was a kid, I've had issues with Body Odor. I am an adult now, and the BO issues are still with me. 

I've been to doctors, done tests, shower at least twice/3 times a day. Cleanse my body both morning tea and lunch time during work.

,SuicideWatch,"I'm a (17M) and I know I'm young but I hate being alive. My distain for being alive started when I was a kid and it has only grown more intense over the years.

 I'll cut to the chase, I have been planning my suicide for years now. When I turn 18, on my birthday I will have a third-party drive me to another state. I will bring a gun and do the deed in a motel. It seems simple but that's just who I am.

 I have been surrounded by good people my whole life. I have a loving mother, a caring stepfather, two loud and lovable brothers and the family dog. My life is by no means perfect, but I'm with the people I love.

 When I was 8 my brothers and I, had to live with our deadbeat, drunkard, abusive, toxic, manipulative, drug addict, lazy, cruel and narcissistic biological father. I, as the oldest tried my hardest to protect my brothers from him. As such, I took the brunt of the abuse. After about a year living with my biological father I involuntarily steeled my emotions. I moved far away from him after 3 entire years of having to shield my brothers from him. It was around then when I felt different.

Due to me involuntarily becoming emotionally distant, I had nothing left that could bring me joy. I had lived through 4 straight years of abuse and my brothers were fine. He's no longer in our lives, I was happy. Things never got better though. I never had any friends growing up because of my cynical views on life. I'm almost an adult and I'm unemployed, unmotivated, suicidal (and I have no way to convey my emotions to others) I have a minor learning disability, an eating disorder and I'm riddled with intense anxiety.

I think I'm a broken human being. The death of the older sister and baby brother I never got the chance to know weigh heavily on my mind. I waste my time slowly becoming more like the father I hate so much. I don't want to end it because I love the people around me, but I can't live like this. No one should live like this, it's cruel. To suffer though 4 years of abuse, to then suddenly be surrounded by good people. To live as the only broken human in a house of smiling people.

 I can't even cry, do you know what it's like to have so many awful emotions and no way of releasing it? I love the people around me, but I hate my life. I'm not asking for help, I just want someone to hear me. I want to know that if no one around me understands me, at least I tried. And that's all I can hope for really.

I tried my best to type out how I feel, sorry if I didn't do a good job of it. That's all.

Probably just, that I'm an asshole, who's just ungrateful. 

I want to become something, but I can't wait anymore. I hate all that waiting, because I never had to wait and I hate that all this is just whining how I was ""never properly raised"" and how no one ""taught me how to live"". I hate it, because I'm just putting the blame, that I'm a useless, lazy dickhead, on others. I'm sick of it and sick of myself. But guess what: I won't change.

That I'm wasting any ""talent"" people told me I had? That I have such a short temper, that I can't stick with anything? That I'm ungrateful as hell for all that I have? I'm just a piece of shit. I hate it. And I don't have any motivation to change that at this point. Friends have been reaching out to me, offered to help my through therapy and what not, but I always just decline and say ""I'll manage"". No, I won't. I'll stay like this forever. Why can't I just accept their offer? Am I too proud? Too stupid? Or am I just attention seeking? Honestly, i sometimes really feel like it, bothering people with my feelings, but as soon as they offer help, I decline. I'm always just whining, without trying to change something. I don't want to live anymore because it always just comes back to me realizing, that I'm trash. That I'll never become something and I'll always just bother people. I will always realize, that I'm gonna die alone with that attitude, so why don't I just end it now, while I have friends? Because I seriously think that there's still a chance. I somehow really believe that all this is just something, that comes with being a teenager, that I'm just whining, should just grow up and learn to work for something.

,SuicideWatch,"I am typing this on my phone, please excuse formatting I'm trying my best. :)


Last year I graduated from high school, 365 days ago. It has amazed me how just 365 days can change so much of yourself. In that time I've gone to the maritime academy of my dreams, lost my girlfriend, and my school burnt down (long story). Seeing how much I've changed over the last year really makes me reflect on who I am, who I was, and possibly who I might become.

But, reflecting also dredges up bad memories and some

*close calls*

It was junior year of highschool when I began to not be ""in the game"", and sidelined myself in life. I had just gotten my first job that summer, and I was working my way through fall semester. I found work easy at school and would find myself on my phone to help pass the time  in class. With new rules the school district was really cracking down on phones in class and writing people up for it. Naturally as well, this didn't follow through well when I would receive detention from school and my parents would hear about it.

To me, my parents image of me was everything, it was the whole reason I worked hard in school. And when that image took a beating so did I. I was so toxic to myself about almost every little thing.

*Fucking kill yourself*
*You stupid piece of shit, can't even remember to bring a pencil*

Those were real thoughts of mine that I wrote in a sort of journal I kept during this time.

Between Thanksgiving and Christmas break I racked up 7  ""cell phone violations"", 2½ hours of detention later I ended up at home.

 First my parents took so much of my toys ( truck, phone, no bed time, had to wake up by a certain time, etc.), but what was worse was the phycological beat down I would give myself. To put it simply, it was BAD. Looking back I fear that part of myself, how bitter and heartless I could be to myself still bewilders me to this day.

I swore that if I got another detention I would kill myself. What scares me is the seriousness in the thought, I just couldn't deal with the demons in my head anymore. This was just as Christmas break began so I knew I would at least spend a ""last Christmas"" with my family to see if it was worth it to stick around.

I lasted untill January 26th, 2018.

I remember the phone call to the office, what it meant, and why I was there. I remember the clouds outside, and how the conversation with the man went in a blur. I remember the yelling, the demeaning and the embarrassment of my parents. And I remember then, the hopelessness I felt.

But then what came next was far worse

I went to school the next day and somberly went through the day, and when I got home my parents weren't.

I looked for almost an hour for some way to finish it, end it all, and rid my waste of flesh from the world.

And then it hit me,

Cars go fast and my truck had no airbags

I went back to the front door and grabbed my keys, my wallet, and a pack of fruit snacks. Just as I stepped out the door I saw my mom coming down the driveway.

In the fleeting moment of panic I dropped every plan I had for the night in fear of being labeled suicidal if I was discovered.

That night was the hardest phycological battle I've ever fought. I just couldn't stand myself anymore, so I fought back. I would write in the journal I had and furiously fight myself, pages and pages. I would fall asleep and wake up only to write more. Spilling things so vile from my mind into those pages I dare to ever read again.

But that night I scared myself terribly, I had mutilated the caustic and poisonous person I became. It was that night that I told to myself, *not yet bitch*

It took months but it got better, I re-evaluated my priorities, changed my habits, and really found myself again.

To say again in case you can't read:

 THIS TOOK MONTHS

And I am an enormously better person than that 17 year old me could've ever hoped to be. 

A friend once said to me, 

""The worst is the worst, it dosent matter how bad it is but if it's the worst you've ever seen, then it's the worst""

Everyone has their own struggles, some worse than others and I want to say and I'm also very happy to say, this was my worst. I have seen the toxicity of a mind and the betrayal of yourself. I've been there, and I'm open to talk about it. If there's something you have to share,

&lt;p&gt;Last year I graduated from high school, 365 days ago. It has amazed me how just 365 days can change so much of yourself. In that time I&amp;#39;ve gone to the maritime academy of my dreams, lost my girlfriend, and my school burnt down (long story). Seeing how much I&amp;#39;ve changed over the last year really makes me reflect on who I am, who I was, and possibly who I might become.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But, reflecting also dredges up bad memories and some&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;close calls&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was junior year of highschool when I began to not be &amp;quot;in the game&amp;quot;, and sidelined myself in life. I had just gotten my first job that summer, and I was working my way through fall semester. I found work easy at school and would find myself on my phone to help pass the time  in class. With new rules the school district was really cracking down on phones in class and writing people up for it. Naturally as well, this didn&amp;#39;t follow through well when I would receive detention from school and my parents would hear about it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To me, my parents image of me was everything, it was the whole reason I worked hard in school. And when that image took a beating so did I. I was so toxic to myself about almost every little thing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Fucking kill yourself&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;em&gt;You stupid piece of shit, can&amp;#39;t even remember to bring a pencil&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Those were real thoughts of mine that I wrote in a sort of journal I kept during this time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Between Thanksgiving and Christmas break I racked up 7  &amp;quot;cell phone violations&amp;quot;, 2½ hours of detention later I ended up at home.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First my parents took so much of my toys ( truck, phone, no bed time, had to wake up by a certain time, etc.), but what was worse was the phycological beat down I would give myself. To put it simply, it was BAD. Looking back I fear that part of myself, how bitter and heartless I could be to myself still bewilders me to this day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I swore that if I got another detention I would kill myself. What scares me is the seriousness in the thought, I just couldn&amp;#39;t deal with the demons in my head anymore. This was just as Christmas break began so I knew I would at least spend a &amp;quot;last Christmas&amp;quot; with my family to see if it was worth it to stick around.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I lasted untill January 26th, 2018.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I remember the phone call to the office, what it meant, and why I was there. I remember the clouds outside, and how the conversation with the man went in a blur. I remember the yelling, the demeaning and the embarrassment of my parents. And I remember then, the hopelessness I felt.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But then what came next was far worse&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I went to school the next day and somberly went through the day, and when I got home my parents weren&amp;#39;t.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I looked for almost an hour for some way to finish it, end it all, and rid my waste of flesh from the world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And then it hit me,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cars go fast and my truck had no airbags&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I went back to the front door and grabbed my keys, my wallet, and a pack of fruit snacks. Just as I stepped out the door I saw my mom coming down the driveway.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the fleeting moment of panic I dropped every plan I had for the night in fear of being labeled suicidal if I was discovered.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That night was the hardest phycological battle I&amp;#39;ve ever fought. I just couldn&amp;#39;t stand myself anymore, so I fought back. I would write in the journal I had and furiously fight myself, pages and pages. I would fall asleep and wake up only to write more. Spilling things so vile from my mind into those pages I dare to ever read again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But that night I scared myself terribly, I had mutilated the caustic and poisonous person I became. It was that night that I told to myself, &lt;em&gt;not yet bitch&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It took months but it got better, I re-evaluated my priorities, changed my habits, and really found myself again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To say again in case you can&amp;#39;t read:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;THIS TOOK MONTHS&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And I am an enormously better person than that 17 year old me could&amp;#39;ve ever hoped to be. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A friend once said to me, &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;The worst is the worst, it dosent matter how bad it is but if it&amp;#39;s the worst you&amp;#39;ve ever seen, then it&amp;#39;s the worst&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Everyone has their own struggles, some worse than others and I want to say and I&amp;#39;m also very happy to say, this was my worst. I have seen the toxicity of a mind and the betrayal of yourself. I&amp;#39;ve been there, and I&amp;#39;m open to talk about it. If there&amp;#39;s something you have to share,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;PLEASE DO.&lt;br/&gt;
SOMEONE IS THERE, YOU JUST HAVE TO LOOK.&lt;/p&gt;

If you asked me what future I would like I would have no answer. I'd like to be dead, so that I don't have a future. If you offered me a billion dollars or death, I'd just take death. I just want to disappear.

Being alive sucks and it has always sucked. I feel like I've had to just lie to myself about being happy some of the time because I'm not always 100% miserable and just to try and make things bearable.

There's a scary thing that happens if you grow up in pain and never know happiness. It's just your baseline. It's just your normal. And you ""adjust"" but when I realized that having adapted to suffering wasn't the same as actually feeling okay, it sort of tears your whole world down. My whole life hasn't been worth the trouble.

It would really make a difference if my mother cared about me, but she didn't and doesn't, and I can't change that. But I don't know how to make up for it. I don't know how to recover from that idea, that my own mother doesn't love me, how could I be worth anything? I know that's irrational but I can't shake it.

There's honestly not that much love in the world. You have to find it, compete for it, earn it. Otherwise you just disappear.

I'm not really that useful to the world. I'm not the most useless person ever, but the world doesn't seem to really need me. I could die and history will proceed exactly the same. The people in my life who don't forget about me immediately, they'll die eventually too.

,SuicideWatch,"Halfway through my 20s, I am divorced, unemployed, living at home. My days are spent trying not to fall asleep, usually failing. I have no motivation, because there's nothing I can gain. I can apply for jobs, but that doesn't make them hire me. I can try to sleep, but that doesn't fix my energy. I can try dating apps or whatever, but that doesn't mean anyone will love me. I can try to think positive, but that doesn't change my reality.

My life has no intrinsic value. I've been sitting here for hours, and I cannot come up with a single quality that gives my life inherent purpose. My value only extends insofar as I can add value to other people. This is my purpose? To sit here all day doing nothing, desperately trying to make myself an asset to the world?

My health issues will worsen with age. I've been plagued by tinnitus and other ear problems as long as I can remember. I'm in a state of perpetual exhaustion because my body doesn't get enough oxygen while I sleep. I've had chronic dizziness for 4 years. My mind is unable to focus, even with adderall. All of this gets worse with age. I've done nothing with my years so far, and life only gets worse.

Depression isn't sadness. It isn't anger. In fact, it isn't anything. It's the absence of feeling. It's a black hole in your chest that sucks any emotions into it. It's a feeling of hollowness, of emptiness. I try to watch a disturbing movie, full of torture and despair. Just to shock me, to strike my soul with ANY emotion. Good or bad, I just want to feel. But my soul remains empty, a black vessel on a voyage to nowhere. It goes in circles. It wears on my mind. It drains my heart. It's chronic emotional exhaustion that I can only take for so long.

What people don't get about suicide is that it isn't an indictment of the support system the person has. It isn't a statement about what people were doing wrong and what they could've done instead. Suicide isn't saying I add no value to the world. It's A Wonderful Life is flaming bullshit that fundamentally misunderstands the issue - George shouldn't commit suicide because he saved the family bank? What if they didn't survive the bank run? Would his life be less valuable? Does the reasoning to stay alive boil down to a list of things that would have gone differently if I weren't around?

No, suicide is exhaustion. Exhaustion with my daily life, exhaustion with fighting my own brain, exhaustion with the hell I put myself in, exhaustion with trying to find a better future that I don't believe exists. It's the release of a breath held so long you feel as though you'll faint. It's the acceptance of my life. It's the realization that I was dealt a shitty hand, and folding is my only option. You can only bluff your way through so many rounds.

I deal with 4 mental disorders and 2 chronic physical conditions, taking a medication cocktail every day to try to keep myself sane. It isn't fucking working. My sleep apnea keeps me exhausted, my ADHD stops me from being productive to fix it, and my depression keeps me locked in this cycle of hopelessness. The other disorders just got thrown in for fun I guess. If there is a God that is meant to give me purpose, he made me from leftovers, from faulty equipment that couldn't be used elsewhere.

I'm not going to fucking kill myself. I don't WANT to kill myself. I physically can't do it. But I want life to be over. I've had enough now, I'd like to get off the ride please. I'd like to go to sleep and stay asleep. I don't want to kill myself. I just want to... not be alive anymore.

But I will wake up tomorrow. I'll wake up exhausted, as I always do. I'll talk to my therapist at our weekly 10am wednesday appointment, and assure him I'm not at risk for self harm. Because I won't be. This raw clarity leaves me as I sleep, and tomorrow I am once again convinced by the illusion that my life has purpose. I'll do that phone interview at 11:30am, knowing full well that it will not lead to anything. Then I'll have the rest of the day to find reasons I should remain alive. 

And what I feel tonight won't last. I'll feel better tomorrow. I may feel better in 30 minutes. I may even feel better in 30 seconds. Because that's how it works. But all I've done is restart the process. I'll pretend to have purpose for a while, convincing myself that life is worth living.

My days are spent trying not to fall asleep, usually failing. I have no motivation, because there&amp;#39;s nothing I can gain. I can apply for jobs, but that doesn&amp;#39;t make them hire me. I can try to sleep, but that doesn&amp;#39;t fix my energy. I can try dating apps or whatever, but that doesn&amp;#39;t mean anyone will love me. I can try to think positive, but that doesn&amp;#39;t change my reality.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My life has no intrinsic value. I&amp;#39;ve been sitting here for hours, and I cannot come up with a single quality that gives my life inherent purpose. My value only extends insofar as I can add value to other people. This is my purpose? To sit here all day doing nothing, desperately trying to make myself an asset to the world?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My health issues will worsen with age. I&amp;#39;ve been plagued by tinnitus and other ear problems as long as I can remember. I&amp;#39;m in a state of perpetual exhaustion because my body doesn&amp;#39;t get enough oxygen while I sleep. I&amp;#39;ve had chronic dizziness for 4 years. My mind is unable to focus, even with adderall. All of this gets worse with age. I&amp;#39;ve done nothing with my years so far, and life only gets worse.&lt;/p&gt;

,SuicideWatch,"So I guess I started going to therapy in around October of last year. I started going to a private service first, which meant I had regular appointments, but obviously the service had to be paid for. I was later moved to a free mental health service run by the government. It started off with a group therapy thing that lasted for a few weeks, every Wednesday. I’m still with that service, just having one-on-one sessions, although since it’s a free service, my appointments are less regular and are usually separated by weeks, I might get one appointment per month, and now, for obvious reasons, the appointments have now been moved to phone calls.

I don’t really think therapy is actually helping me at all. I don’t understand why I want to commit suicide, I’ve never been through any sort of traumatic event that MADE me feel like this, I just sort of do. The phone calls usually only last about ten minutes max, and they’re always the same conversation. She asks me questions, I’ll say either ‘yes, no, I don’t know, etc’, because there’s literally nothing to actually SAY. I just feel like therapy has had an almost negative effect on me.

Like the other day, I was actually enjoying myself, I was watching stuff on Netflix and I was able to almost forget I was even really a person, and then my therapist calls, immediately it ruins my day by reminding me of my suicidal thoughts by asking ‘do you still have thoughts about not wanting to be alive anymore?’ And of course I do. I think about suicide almost all the time because it feels like there’s NOTHING left to live for. She asks the question and I say yeah, and that’s just sort of it? Like what’s even the point in her asking me that because it never feels like she actually does anything to help me, she just REMINDS me of it and then goes ‘oh okay 🧚‍♀️✨’. I know it’s not her fault, I know that’s her job, but it’s not really helping at all.

My sister also called me a schizo for going to therapy, and my mam thinks I should be cured by now and over the whole therapy thing. It feels like people look down at me for going. I want to give it up because I’ve been trying this for months now with three different therapists, from the private, to group to this service, and it has done nothing but remind me that I simply hate being alive and that there’s probably no way I’ll ever not feel like that.

I grew up in a super dysfunctional home and I’ve felt isolated from everyone else for as long as I can remember.

The worst age was 14. I was in an abusive relationship, my parents were emotionally and physically abusive, teachers wrote me off and other students bullied me. I had almost no friends and my body was covered with cystic acne.

Looking back, I also probably had some form of depression, anxiety or ADHD. The symptoms were apparent, but nobody was willing to get me the help I needed.

Trust me I have tried nearly everything.But sorry to all the people hating.Sorry that I exist and bother you so much by just existing.People dont want to have anything to do with me just because Im a ugly looser.Again I did not choose to be that way...this leads to me developing social anxiety on a high level and not believing in myself at all.I probably wasted the best time of my life playing video games...damn I really thought I could be a professional player but bad luck doesnt stop there either.Even tho gaming is my escape.and by now the only environment I feel really comfortable in because thats the only thing I have EVER been good in but of course not good enough to make something out of it.When Im playing no one insults me cause I look bad cuz thats not what counts.My entire life is a full on failure.Everyone hates me without even having talked to me once.Goddamn I have a crush on a girl for months and she doesnt even know my name.Of course she wouldnt be interested anyways,but it still hurts.Every day I think about suiciding,every single one.Maybe one day I would find a shit job cause Im useless anyways and then work until I fucking die alone in my room.  
Im not gonna let it get that far...I rather end my life then live completely lonely and full of pain.Like honestly why should I not just end my life now Instead of suffering?

No one would even care if I kill myself like actually no one. I think people would actually be happy that Im finally gone cuz Im a useless ugly bastard anyways.This world is better off without me.The only thing Im sure about is that Im not gonna be able to get through this much longer.I didnt picture my life like this...not at all.I honestly dont wanna die I just want to go  to a better place and it seems like suicide is the only way to escape this.

There is no hope left for me at all and I see no other way out.Every day I get a new reason to kill myself but I never get reasons not to,like why should I live if I cant enjoy life anyways....I just  want to cry but I cant I dont understand why I have all this bad luck and why I have to suffer so much I just cant take this anymore.Every day I hope something magical happens and changes my life but it doesnt.Everyone in my city hates me or/and laughs about me.Other people just tell me how good there life is .&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No one would even care if I kill myself like actually no one. I think people would actually be happy that Im finally gone cuz Im a useless ugly bastard anyways.This world is better off without me.The only thing Im sure about is that Im not gonna be able to get through this much longer.I didnt picture my life like this...not at all.I honestly dont wanna die I just want to go  to a better place and it seems like suicide is the only way to escape this.&lt;br/&gt;
Why am I posting this on here? Because I hope maybe someone out there cares ...even if its just a little bit.&lt;br/&gt;
Thx for reading.&lt;/p&gt;

It is a restless angst that I should be doing better, knowing more, can never be content with simple bliss/peace because it can be rationalized away AND, even if I pretend, it means there’s no inner conflict... which means stagnation. (And it’s more than this, this sounds like something close to teenagery nihilism, but it’s not that, I rationalize *everything,* even rationalization and so on and so forth.) 

I’ll give you an example, I can’t just hang out with my old friends anymore and be carefree the way I used to knowing what I know now (I can’t explain it, if you know you know, if you don’t you can only guess based on your limited experience and you won’t understand it.) they just talk about their boyfriends all day, so clueless. I can’t love my family without seeing the meaninglessness of it, and the meaninglessness of meaninglessness, and so on and so forth until the stars explode. My issues are not external but internal. I could have everything I’ve ever wanted and still be on the ledge over the lip of the abyss perpetually. 

Sorry for the #im14andthisisdeep post. But I’m really struggling over here to the point I’m using stupid vague writing and metaphors about abysses. It’s definitely an existential depression but I’m sure my external conditions aren’t helping. 

I don’t know, it would be so nice to talk to people, the reach for connection, especially anyone who’s been through the same.  People never really talked to me much, especially in this country, I was kinda a weirdo growing up. 

Um. Sorry I’m a shitty writer. (Do not say the contrary to be nice, anyways, shitty writing is mostly imprecise writing... too tired and drained for anything better...)

None of the mental health professionals understand what my problem is. “Maybe if you started a family...” no, that’s not it, it’s a constant restlessness and uneasiness with your being and existence and it’s largely not related to other people. Most of the philosophers I’ve read are pretty pessimistic, which logic seems to nearly always be, can’t live with their conclusions even if it’s “true” in a strictly logical sense. Once you start pulling on the red threads of emotions you thought were indisputably real the world is undone and gets very bleak very quickly... 

I don’t even care if this made no sense to you, but I appreciate anything.

,SuicideWatch,"I don't really know how to begin this wall of text, but let me preface this by saying that i am under 18 and a male, that's as much as i'm willing to say.
For a while my passions were able to fill the gaping hole in my soul, things like programming, writing, drawing, music. Until i just couldn't sustain it anymore. I suppose i have to dig down to the root of the problem.

**YOU'RE A PIECE OF SHIT, ME**

I get good grades. I have friends, both in real life and online. I have hobbies. Why the fuck can't i just be happy.

I really hate the image of myself that i give off to other people, when inside i feel completely different. I like to pretend that i don't care about most things, and most people seem to believe that i'm like that, even though i care more than i'd like to admit.

I've always been difficult for me to express myself, especially when i speak english better than my native language. I can't just talk about my feelings without cringing.

I used to dream of being a game developer, until i gave up on that dream. Most people still believe i want to do that, because i haven't told them about all the others things i like, and again, i cringe at the thought of doing so. It feels like my life is heading in a direction i don't want. I could be a writer, but i'd run out of ideas. I could be a musician, but i don't even know anymore.
When i feel depressed, everything seems impossible. All my dreams go down the drain. Life feels like an insurmountable challenge.

I seek to be known in the world. Not necessarily remembered, i just want my existance to be known while i am alive.

I don't speak to my friends about my problems because they'd probably tell me that i'm oversharing and i need to talk to my parents.
I don't talk to my parents about my problems because i feel too afraid of it.
I don't go to therapy because i need my parents to be able to do that, and if the therapist finds out that i am in immediate danger then they will have to inform my relatives.

I feel envious of other people when they have some positive personality trait or skill or material possesion or just anything that they have and i don't. This eventually just leads me to feeling unnecesarily angry at people who don't deserve it because i'm a greedy shitbag who wants everything in the world.
I hate most people just because of this. Sorry.

I am slowly losing interest in things that i used to enjoy. School or no school. Work or no work. It doesn't matter. This is getting boring. No matter how much time i have i will waste it laying in bed doing absolutely nothing. Not even looking at my phone or anything. Just nothing.

Life feels incredibly unfulfilling. I have no idea where i'm going with my life. The future is murky. And as i slowly lose interest in the things i do, i just want to shut my brain off and sleep forever.

I feel lonely even though i am surrounded by people that care for me. I push my family away. My friends don't care all that much, they just want to have fun, and i can't blame them honestly.

There is not a single day in my life where i am not worrying about something. Be it either what i said, what i did or how other people view me.

It all just feels so shitty. And i'm getting tired.

If i ever were to die, i want my death to be one final ""FUCK YOU"" to the entire world. Even though barely anybody would care. My relatives would probably be extremely sad. My friends would probably be a bit shaken. Other people would just be confused, probably. Other than that, the rest of the country or the world wouldn't care. But let's be honest, i don't have the means or the guts to do it.

I'm just a guy who is trying his best to smile and staying optimistic

*Coughs*

Life has been very harsh on me the last couple of months, I have lost all friends and other sources of emotional support and I was thinking about committing suicide as well (dw, I'm fine now and I won't do it)

I just want someone to whom I can text frequently.

,SuicideWatch,"Hey guys! It's kind of funny but I've recently found this sub and I think it'll be really therapeutic to talk about stuff here???

So I've been through another heartbreak recently, and with lockdown and not the best family life I've kind of accepted that I will die soon? I've got full plan and all and I'm ready to go as well, just that I don't know when exactly within the next X days.

I hate to think about it this way, but my life for the last 6-7 years or so has been pretty botched in the sense of: Here's one amazing year for you, but suck it up cuz the next two are going to be downright horrible.

I've just kind of accepted really peacefully and with a lot of calm that y'know, maybe it's time to call it a day. Because I'm really really tired of this cycle constantly happening and I've just gotta cut my losses. They say life's a gamble, and sometimes you gotta walk away from the table because you're just getting bad hands.

I've spent the last few days connecting and calling some of my closest friends in the world, and I've just let them know about it plus telling them how much they all mean to me and how much I'll miss them. But yeah I more or less know what I have to do, just sharing my thoughts here.

I'm really not upset or sad about it, I feel like I've lived a really decent life as well. For all the pitfalls, I've managed to do things that most wouldn't haven't ever lived through for their entire lives, and for that, I'm grateful. 

I'm really in a place of peace, and serenity. I'm looking forward to my rest. I just want to stop living in the cycle. Also, multiverse theory gave me comfort. Y'know the one where every decision creates a different universe. (Probably the wrong interpretation but LOL) I'd like to think that somewhere out there, in this great big cosmic space we live in, there's another me, where all my dreams, hopes and love having coming through. And he's happy and at peace, just as I will be very soon.

,SuicideWatch,"I had been dating my ex for about 2 1/2 years. As my time through high-school progressed I started to become more and more depressed and anxious in general because of school, friend, and relationship related. When I would feel these ways, I would feel better when I talk to my ex and friends about my feelings. I talked to them too much and ended up deterring the friends I used to have away. Always still, I had my ex. We were toxic for each other and it hurts to admit it but I want to be the one she says she loves and to be the one she wants to hold in her arms. I don’t know if I couldn’t or didn’t fix the problems I had of jealousy, over sensitivity to anger, and controlling my emotions. I wanted to so badly. I don’t know why I never could. The same problems would repeat and repeat. All I had to do was to fix the problems. We got to the point where I said I wanted to break up on dec 31 2019 in the heat of the argument we were having. I instantly regretted it. That was it. We stopped talking for a few months but gradually started to talk more and more. We got closer again and slowly stopped having the same problems. Around this time it was harder. It was nearing the end of junior year with school stresses and one of my closest friends basically told me I made him feel suicidal and our whole friendship was fake and he never wanted it. He would also talk to me about his problems and I knew that he tended to be sensitive when in a mental state like that and I and our mutual friends knew he didn’t mean it. Nonetheless it really hurt and ended up dividing the 4 friends I had helping me through the breakup to go from talking to each other and planning hangout weekly to nothing anymore. 2 months after that, my ex and I continued to talk and had been acting like we were in a relationship but not entirely. We could tell each other “you’re so handsome!”,”you’re so pretty”,”I care about you so much to the moon and back”, and other like things like that. We would continue to see each other the few times we could and would hold hands, kiss, and cuddle. 4 days ago, she had told me that she was thinking of getting back together. I told her I understand and wanted to take things slowly because we still weren’t in the best mental states. I’d still be really depressed from losing a bunch of close friends and understanding our relationship wasn’t the same and she had been going through similarly with her friends. I was happy but was weary because I didn’t want to get back into it too quickly and wanted to take things slowly and carefully because I didn’t want to make the same mistakes again. We ended the night saying let’s just take things slowly and focus on each next obstacle of getting back together one by one. The next night we talked and she though about everything. How it would work out and when. How her parents would immediately be disappointed and how college would be and how it wouldn’t be secure. She admitted to me that she felt this way for a while but since it just felt good and she found my presence comforting(“you are so comforting”*said all sentimentally and shit) as I found her being in my life great.  She admitted and apologized for being selfish and not telling me about these feelings and that she doesn’t think getting back together is worth the view of her family on her. Her family is very critical of her and the time before we got back together, they openly expressed their disappointment with her, really hurting her mental health and self confidence. I said I forgave her and left and spent the entire night crying. The last few days I had been thinking about it day and night. How I could convince her that I was worth it. Yesterday, I said please, we can push through the barriers and get through this. She said no. I don’t know what to do now because aside from being my ex, she’s my closest friend. She’s my best friend. I still love her as I did in the relationship and as my best friend. I don’t want to lose another person that I love and care for so much as I have been for so long now but talking not as if we are anything but friends is hard for me. I have 4 friends I can talk to but I don’t ever feel relieved or good anymore if I vent or talk about my emotions to them. It feels like I will only feel okay if I have her again. I’ve been consistan suicidal for the last 2 years and have been trying so hard to get better since Jan 2020, but everything has only went downhill. I can’t have her anymore and don’t ever feel okay. I used to want happiness but I don’t anymore. I just don’t want to feel anymore. I want to die. I want to hurt myself. I can’t though and it feels suffocating. I can’t let out my emotions because there is no relief to it. I can’t kill myself because I’m too scared. I am so fucking lucky to be born in a loving and caring lower upper class family.

,SuicideWatch,"I have dealt with my mental health ever since I was a child. I got depressed at age 12. Had an unstable manipulative mother with her own issues and didn’t get to see much of my dad growing up. I have had bad general anxiety and social anxiety all growing up that’s only worsened since. I have ptsd not only from childhood trauma but from when I was sexually assaulted at 16. I have struggled accepting my sexuality and I know my mom doesn’t believe it’s a thing. I’ve lost all my friends and go on periods where I isolate from everyone. My senior year of highschool I got evicted from my home and started therapy. Within a year I watched both of my grandparents suffer for months and then die. I began starving myself and lost 30-40lbs in a month Then a few months later I got partially hospitalized for cutting and other suicidal behaviors and thoughts. I was diagnosed with bipolar and major depression also. 2-3 months later I attempted suicide. I had remained at the partial hospital for 6+ months. I had met amazing people there that saved my life and helped me get better. I even met someone that I fell for and gave me hope. Everything was going good and I even started community college, but my mood swings came back even while being on 4 different medications. One of my best friends stopped talking to me.

I got depressed at age 12. Had an unstable manipulative mother with her own issues and didn’t get to see much of my dad growing up. I have had bad general anxiety and social anxiety all growing up that’s only worsened since. I have ptsd not only from childhood trauma but from when I was sexually assaulted at 16. I have struggled accepting my sexuality and I know my mom doesn’t believe it’s a thing. I’ve lost all my friends and go on periods where I isolate from everyone. My senior year of highschool I got evicted from my home and started therapy. Within a year I watched both of my grandparents suffer for months and then die. I began starving myself and lost 30-40lbs in a month Then a few months later I got partially hospitalized for cutting and other suicidal behaviors and thoughts. I was diagnosed with bipolar and major depression also. 2-3 months later I attempted suicide. I had remained at the partial hospital for 6+ months. I had met amazing people there that saved my life and helped me get better. I even met someone that I fell for and gave me hope. Everything was going good and I even started community college, but my mood swings came back even while being on 4 different medications. One of my best friends stopped talking to me. I nearly failed last semester and have lost all motivation to work for a future.

,SuicideWatch,"I posted on here before about my recent attempt and dealing with the shame and aftermath, and I’m ready to share with you guys my reasons because one of them is something I feel like isn’t talked about.



I have bipolar disorder and ADHD, and struggle with RSD (rejection sensitivity disorder) due to the ADHD. Over the years medication and therapy got me to a somewhat stable place but I think I mostly felt numb.



I was in a toxic relationship for 3 years with someone who abuses drugs. All kinds - coke, Xanax, heroin, literally anything and I love this man so much, but on drugs he’s a different person. The constant high and lows took a toll on me. I felt isolated and I couldn’t even bring him around my friends or family without worrying about him getting high and embarrassing me. He smoked meth in front of my younger sister so I eventually cracked. I broke up with him and told him I would be moving out. Later that night he attempted to overdose on Xanax and heroin and was sent to a psychiatric hospital and then to rehab, haven’t been able to talk to him.



I feel like the guilt was eating at me. He blamed me, his family blamed me, I felt like a terrible person. My best friend of 10 years who was my major support system dropped me a few days later because her boyfriend admitted an attraction to me and she resents me now. So she unfriended me and he blocked me. It was just so sudden and I was so confused why she would act this way. She knew I was going through a lot with my ex just attempting suicide, and thought this petty issue was worth dropping me for. It was just so insensitive.



I reached out to another friend who I admittedly have an attraction to but it was long distance and we couldn’t ever make it work. So we agreed on staying friends. He actually convinced me to break up with my boyfriend and leave my toxic relationship but now I don’t even know if it was for the right reasons or he just wanted something from me. Either way, he was super affectionate with me telling me I was beautiful and it wasn’t my fault and that he would come see me to keep me company. I was in a fragile state after losing the 2 closest people in my life. I reached out for help when I lost my best friend and he didn’t answer. I waited 2 days and then asked why he was leaving me on seen and then he told me he was just trying to live his life and blocked me on everything. So now another person had cut me off and made me feel like I was a huge annoying inconvenience. 


I felt like everyone hated me. I posted something on social media and people were coming at me and leaving me hate comments. I normally wouldn’t let something like this get to me but it came from the heart and I was feeling very sensitive and hate was the last thing I needed in that moment.


I tried to overdose. I posted on my social media it would be my last, and that it was always my intention to love these people and not hurt them but I felt like I was just tossed away like trash by the people I cared about the most. Someone left comments making fun of me for attention seeking or killing myself over a Facebook post. But someone called for me. Actually, multiple people did. I had over 200 messages from people concerned about me. When I saw this after my ER discharge I felt stupid that I let 3 people in my life get to me when there were so many people who cared.


Losing people you care about is hard, especially if they’re your closest support system. But the guilt of someone trying to kill themselves because of you, whether they succeed or not is overwhelming. I didn’t get the help I needed because I gave up after reaching out to 2 people.

My first suicide attempt was when I was 13 - the after-attempts and hospitalization trips that followed remained continuously from then onwards. I'm 23 now. The suicide attempts have stopped for the last 2 years or so.

,SuicideWatch,"I'm 23 and I have been depressed since I was 13, been through hell with social services etc and school, I had an under 10 percent attendance the whole of high school, have 0 grades and was nearly put in a home.

I just didnt care what happened to me, i didn't care about anything. I was being bullied quite badly(physically)

I had hardly left my room in many many years and I have to admit, I kind of absolutely hate other people. And I'm sure they hate me.

Anyway now I'm on my own, got kicked out for addiction problems and stuff and been through homeless service. The sad thing is, I remember thinking to myself alot,  being excited that I might actually hit rock bottom so hard, that it might push me to go through with killing myself this time.

I just exist. I have no goals. Or aspirations. I care for naught. I've sabotaged relationships, all sorts because.... Well I don't know...... I'm a piece of shit cunt.

I get up, play ps4 and sleep, I never eat or go out due to panic disorder etc. I collect my shitty benefit and get scolded all the time and looked at like scum because I still wear clothes that I was wearing when i was 14.. I don't think I've ever been impolite in public to anyone, in fact I try way too fucking hard to be nice. I think. I don't fucking know. 

My life is fucking meaningless and I hate that people think if I was to stop the pain, that it would be selfish.

The only thing that ever stopped me was fear. I'm just so scared of dying slowly and painfully whilst being conscious, it horrifies me.

If there was a button to instantly do it, I'd have pressed it many years ago.

All this rage and anger I have about the past just doesn't go away, no matter how much I talk to therapists or go out to clubs and take pills. I'm so fucked and the doctor just legally isn't allowed to tell me that, but I know she would if she could.

Bullies dictated my life. And they're doing fucking fantastic. What happened to all the people saying karma exists because it fucking doesn't.

The only thing that would make my life better and make me happy is knowing that the man that molested the love of my life for 5 years whilst I was dating her when I was 13 to 18 years old, got fucking killed. That's it, any other way I'm not satisfied. I don't give a shit. The horrible horrible unspeakable things he did right under my nose are unforgivable. I hope one day I can go to jail for that cunt to be very honest, at least my life will have amounted to Something. I'll atleast have saved a future victim from him.

Oh don't even get me started on the bullies that pissed on me repeatedly and would threaten me with knives etc

I was such a soft kid who didn't even know what his dick was for at the age of 12. I never hurt anyone, but everyone hurt me.

Fuck the world, private pyle had it right and shot that fucker in the face before taking himself out of this shit hole.

,SuicideWatch,"im a 17 year old queer autistic kid whos deluded himself into thinking hes a man. im receiving support through the NDIS to help me with school and basic tasks i cant do properly because im autistic. i hate getting help. i hate NEEDING help. i feel infantalised and emasculated by the way teachers and mentor figures have to treat me so i dont fucking cry and have a breakdown because i dont wanna do my homework. or my schoolwork. or work in general. or improve myself in any fucking way shape or form.

im a creative person. i like to write and draw. im a good singer. i had a main role in last year’s school production. but im burned out. i only ever wrote shitty explicit fanfic, i cant be bothered drawing unless im tracing something in ms paint, i cant write song lyrics, and this years production has been cancelled for obvious reasons.

ive been struggling with school for years. i was in year 11 VCE last year, but i didnt get enough assessments finished for a passing grade. ive been moved into year 11 VCAL. to non-australian people, this means that not only have i been held back a grade, but i’ve been moved into a program designed for people who want to join the workforce as soon as possible. carpenters, mechanics, you get the idea.

everyone in VCAL acts like a fucking crackhead all the time. my school is already full of bogans but jesus fucking christ it’s a warzone in there. no one ever shuts up, they all just run around the room and talk to their friends, ignoring the designated seating arrangements (even before social distancing was a factor. yes, VCAL locks us into assigned seating in high school. again, i feel fucking infantalised.)

i hate VCAL. i hate being associated with these people. i hate that anyone i couldve called a friend last year has moved on to year 12 VCE like normal, competent people who i can never talk to again. i hate that i cant talk to people at school because i have been bullied for as long as ive been in the education system and now i always feel like i’m imposing myself on people if i so much as look at them.

i hate that i’m no better than anyone else in VCAL because i dont do the work either. at least everyone else can fuck around with their friends all day. i’m just the fat douchebag tranny who frequently bursts into tears and never even takes my books out of my bag. i think most of the teachers have given up on making me engage in classes. at this point they’re just keeping up appearances when they acknowledge my presence.

im only in VCAL because the school counsellors all told me i should and i never say no to their ideas because theres no fucking point. im only in VCAL because the workload is meant to be lighter and more bearable and i can tie my projects into my special interests. if only i could talk about my interests without fucking cringing until i implode because what self respecting teenager fucking hyperfocuses on splatoon? who fucking cares?

im probably only trans because my dad died when i was 5 and now i have daddy issues. my two older sisters are both living shitty lives. my eldest sister is 22 and still lives at home playing video games in her room all day. she has no friends. the second oldest is 19 and lives with her boyfriend in a shitty relationship shes not happy with, but they both smoke pot and vape and whatever so they dont have to care. i hate knowing we’ve changed so much. we’re not kids anymore and i wish we were just so i didnt have to worry about getting spat out of mandatory education as a directionless burnout who would rather die than disappoint or inconvenience anyone ever again. i dont want to end up like either of my older sisters

but i have a little sister as well. shes 11 years younger than me. i was almost just like her when i was her age. an annoying tech-obsessed brat with violent outbursts. i cant stand being around her. no one in the house knows how to deal with her and i know from experience its going to fuck her up forever. the thought of ruining her life fucking hurts more than anything. but just like everything else, i dont know how to stop it and i cant be bothered to change that.

tl;dr at school, im an inconsolable douchebag who assumes the worst in everyone and makes a point to never engage in school even though i constantly get help for that. at home i’m a lazy asshole who distracts myself with video games, discord and youtube all day and rages at my little sister for being just like me as a kid. im all too aware how shitty my habits are, but i’m too lazy to improve, too lazy to learn, too lazy to live.

the only upside is that im too lazy to kill myself for now. i cant be bothered buying anything to mix with the eucalyptus oil so i dont puke it right away, and im pretty sure i would just fail and make everyone miserable and waste space in a hospital. but im going to kill myself at some point. every day that i dont is just delaying the inevitable.",t2_3h6xlr9l,False,,0,False,i have a potentially lethal case of “can’t be assed”,[],r/SuicideWatch,False,0,,0,,False,t3_h09qod,False,dark,0.9,,public,8,0,{},,False,[],,False,False,,{},,False,8,,False,,False,,[],{},,True,,1591820301.0,text,0,,,text,self.SuicideWatch,False,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;im a 17 year old queer autistic kid whos deluded himself into thinking hes a man. im receiving support through the NDIS to help me with school and basic tasks i cant do properly because im autistic. i hate getting help. i hate NEEDING help. i feel infantalised and emasculated by the way teachers and mentor figures have to treat me so i dont fucking cry and have a breakdown because i dont wanna do my homework. or my schoolwork. or work in general. or improve myself in any fucking way shape or form.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;im a creative person. i like to write and draw. im a good singer. i had a main role in last year’s school production. but im burned out. i only ever wrote shitty explicit fanfic, i cant be bothered drawing unless im tracing something in ms paint, i cant write song lyrics, and this years production has been cancelled for obvious reasons.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;ive been struggling with school for years. i was in year 11 VCE last year, but i didnt get enough assessments finished for a passing grade. ive been moved into year 11 VCAL. to non-australian people, this means that not only have i been held back a grade, but i’ve been moved into a program designed for people who want to join the workforce as soon as possible. carpenters, mechanics, you get the idea.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;everyone in VCAL acts like a fucking crackhead all the time. my school is already full of bogans but jesus fucking christ it’s a warzone in there. no one ever shuts up, they all just run around the room and talk to their friends, ignoring the designated seating arrangements (even before social distancing was a factor. yes, VCAL locks us into assigned seating in high school. again, i feel fucking infantalised.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;i hate VCAL. i hate being associated with these people. i hate that anyone i couldve called a friend last year has moved on to year 12 VCE like normal, competent people who i can never talk to again. i hate that i cant talk to people at school because i have been bullied for as long as ive been in the education system and now i always feel like i’m imposing myself on people if i so much as look at them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;i hate that i’m no better than anyone else in VCAL because i dont do the work either. at least everyone else can fuck around with their friends all day. i’m just the fat douchebag tranny who frequently bursts into tears and never even takes my books out of my bag. i think most of the teachers have given up on making me engage in classes. at this point they’re just keeping up appearances when they acknowledge my presence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;im only in VCAL because the school counsellors all told me i should and i never say no to their ideas because theres no fucking point. im only in VCAL because the workload is meant to be lighter and more bearable and i can tie my projects into my special interests. if only i could talk about my interests without fucking cringing until i implode because what self respecting teenager fucking hyperfocuses on splatoon? who fucking cares?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;im probably only trans because my dad died when i was 5 and now i have daddy issues. my two older sisters are both living shitty lives. my eldest sister is 22 and still lives at home playing video games in her room all day. she has no friends. the second oldest is 19 and lives with her boyfriend in a shitty relationship shes not happy with, but they both smoke pot and vape and whatever so they dont have to care. i hate knowing we’ve changed so much. we’re not kids anymore and i wish we were just so i didnt have to worry about getting spat out of mandatory education as a directionless burnout who would rather die than disappoint or inconvenience anyone ever again. i dont want to end up like either of my older sisters&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;but i have a little sister as well. shes 11 years younger than me. i was almost just like her when i was her age. an annoying tech-obsessed brat with violent outbursts. i cant stand being around her. no one in the house knows how to deal with her and i know from experience its going to fuck her up forever. the thought of ruining her life fucking hurts more than anything. but just like everything else, i dont know how to stop it and i cant be bothered to change that.&lt;/p&gt;

Then comes September 2019 and a new school year starts. I try to make an effort to be nice to him and we’re super cool again. He is popular and I’m not so he has a gf. He had been with this girl who he absolutely loves for 6 months or so and now we are in lockdown, he found out he’s going to leave my country to go to Paris. He is obviously very sad and chose to brake up with his girl. I’m close friends with his girl and all so I know both sides. He then makes mean comments to his ex’s friend on a group chat and then gets into an argument with his ex and just says he should probably just kill himself. His ex tells me but not too worried because she and I know he likes attention and is a bit dramatic. But then today we had an argument and he brought up that he should kill himself again. I don’t know how seriously I should take this and don’t want to feel guilt for life if he kills himself. Just wondering if any kind Redditor could help me out on this one.&lt;/p&gt;

Despite her living half way across the world he got very attached to her, even calling her the love of his life. A couple of weeks ago they broke up and I've been checking up on him often to see how he is and he says he is okay; I haven't noticed any changes in his overall behaviour. This morning I got a message from on of his roblox friends who also lives half way across the world telling me that he is concerned for my brothers mental health as my brother has told him he has been having suicidal thoughts and mentioning he has a knife close to him.

,SuicideWatch,"I have until the end of the year to kms. 

If I can’t find heroin, I’m going to use a noose and do it in the woods. If that won’t work I’ll starve and dehydrate myself to death. If that won’t work I’ll jump off a building, drown myself, or jump in front of a train. I’m pretty determined. But I also aim for perfection. 

So I’ve realized that my life is pretty much over. It’s been over since I was born. Born into a shitty family, born as a birth defect (I’m trans mtf), and I was bullied relentlessly in school. 

I was around 8-10 since I became really depressed and suicidal. Parents kept fighting. My bro and I never got along. I hated myself because I knew I was in the wrong body and the never ending 24/7 dysphoria. Kids at school bullied me to no end. Every fucking day. I dreaded going to school. I dreaded coming home to hear and see a dysfunctional family. 

I have no family. My mother is stupid. She believes in God and in the Quran. Apparently I’m a sinner and a man to her. She’s very manipulative and she helped sabotage my first relationship. I live with her rn because I’m trying to find my own place before I move out instead of being homeless for another year. 

Anyway, she’s a cunt. My brother is an asshole and has his own issues. He hates me. 

I dropped out of university when I was 19, so I can kms. But I found out about hormones so I went to grab them via informed consent.

&lt;p&gt;If I can’t find heroin, I’m going to use a noose and do it in the woods. If that won’t work I’ll starve and dehydrate myself to death. If that won’t work I’ll jump off a building, drown myself, or jump in front of a train. I’m pretty determined. But I also aim for perfection. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So I’ve realized that my life is pretty much over. It’s been over since I was born. Born into a shitty family, born as a birth defect (I’m trans mtf), and I was bullied relentlessly in school. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was around 8-10 since I became really depressed and suicidal. Parents kept fighting. My bro and I never got along. I hated myself because I knew I was in the wrong body and the never ending 24/7 dysphoria. Kids at school bullied me to no end. Every fucking day. I dreaded going to school. I dreaded coming home to hear and see a dysfunctional family. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have no family. My mother is stupid. She believes in God and in the Quran. Apparently I’m a sinner and a man to her. She’s very manipulative and she helped sabotage my first relationship. I live with her rn because I’m trying to find my own place before I move out instead of being homeless for another year. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyway, she’s a cunt. My brother is an asshole and has his own issues. He hates me. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I dropped out of university when I was 19, so I can kms. But I found out about hormones so I went to grab them via informed consent. It’s helped immensely, but the only problem is that it won’t undo puberty and no one wants to pay for my medical surgeries.

I have a extreme situation that can't be recovered from; needless to say I will never be able to describe it fully enough for many to understand. In fact; the less details I provide many may think I'm guilty of the crime. Alas; my grief is because I am not guilty, and I alone will be the one to know that.

My wife has decided to protect her kids. I respect that. An incident of over friendliness has made our youngest think I'm a creep; I am too naive to be a creep. I'm a sysadmin, and I deal with reports and data... but I'm out of my league here.

At lunch (four days ago) I kissed my wife before I left, and asked if we might sit down later and find a good movie. She's been at work a lot at night lately, so I had some weird internal feeling of missing her more than usual. I left for work and all was fine.

I became homeless in an instant. I was at work and told of a calamity of deceiving appearances. I am labeled a creep; and my wife says she believes me, but has to take care of the kids. She is going to be homeless too, and tells me I shouldn't worry about them anymore. I feel obligated because these were my kids for 2 and a half years. She still tells me she loves me... I brought her from bad to worse and now their option is to move in with a formerly abusive ex (as roommates splitting bills I'm told). I love them all; and I was innocent. I might be guilty of negligence, but I was am too gregarious and didn't put up firm boundaries as an adult. Something as simple as scratching a back of a relative could be perceived in a variety of ways; even if it's customarily normal for months, one day it could be seen as something else.

alas; I'll forever be the only one who can believe me. I can't question my 10 year old daughter on a stand. I respect that I lost this fight... with no chance for a defense to take place. I've been assaulted and I never want my kids to fear that from me. That's nowhere near close to what actually took place, but it gives you the context to understand the severity. It's just so wrong; because I wasn't guilty... but I'll die a marked and guilty man.

I can't live like this. This isn't my first suicidal thought. I just can't keep doing this.  I can't live a life with my wife telling me she loves me; but never seeing it through, or believing I would give anything for them and never bring them harm.

I'm infuriated that there is no such thing as TRUE EXTERNAL TESTIMONY. I loathe this world for making it a he said - she said elaboration frenzy instead of being able to come together and see the truth.

Does therapy help? because I'm paid in a few days and currently on the streets in the company van. my employer doesn't know I'm sleeping in it.

i never opened up to anybody before but today is a day that i hope never happened.

i am terrified, i can't think straight and english is not my first language so sorry if all this doesn't seem to make sense.

so, i am a teenager who has spent all her life being the strong one. I'm the smallest(?) child of three and even if we always were good with each other there's a lot of issues and we all struggle with expressing emotions like sadness and anger because my mother who raised us alone was raised in a hostile climate and never taught us how to deal with those feelings.

my father was abusive and violent but thankfully he never did anything to me. my brother was his favorite so he didn't get hurt either but I grew up seeing my sister being punished and hit violently regularly. tbh all my memories are blurry but one time he whipped her so hard she bleed and this image has stuck with me since.

thankfully my mother managed to make him leave home but to this day he still has a grip on us and is in our life because of many divorce issues and other bs. this asshole stole a bunch of our money and my sick mother can't do any more than she does.

anyways, after he left (i was between 8 and 11 old at the time, my brain won't let me remember exactly) i went to a psy but idk if i rigged the exams or if it was just hidden but they couldn't find anything wrong w me. my sister had severe depression and i think she tried to commit suicide i have no clue. my brother is a special case, he has always been weird and I've never seen him cry and he's kinda toxic each time i express sadness so i prefer not to talk abou

Because, as you may know, I am killing myself softly and slowly, with drugs and pills and smoke, so much smoke I feel like a hot air balloon. I want my whole body to be nothing but benzodiazepine, marijuana and nicotine. I want my organs to fail me one by one until I become ash and drift, with no direction into a wide, depressing unknown. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In short, I want to die.&lt;/p&gt;

,SuicideWatch,"I'm in one of those really good high schools where not having great grades is considered a sin. If it were up to me, I would go to some normal boring school where I can actually have some good grades without stressing my brains out every day, maybe even meet some people who I'm not terrified to talk to (talking to people who know exactly what they want to do in life and have straight As is pretty hard when you barely pass most of the classes), but there was no way my mom would let that happen and now that I do have a chance to change schools after the first year... I can't really make myself do it. Yeah, I miss going to a normal school, but I live in Poland, English is about the only thing I'm good at and there's no way I'm trading my school's level of English for a class of morons who after learning for 9 years still can't remember what Present Simple is for.

Speaking of my mom, she's an abusive narcissistic... deeply flawed human being. I never thought I could hate anyone so much. And then there's my dad who thinks he's the best father in the world and doesn't understand why I want to hit him in the face with my math textbook (over 400 pages) most of the time. The answer is: he does nothing but argue with her and let her pretend everything's fine afterwards - and thinks he's doing everything he can. The situation is more difficult with him, because I still love the idea of him. I think. I can't make myself hate him like I do my mother and it's awful, because once the anger fades a little I feel so guilty for ever thinking anything bad about him.

I have two friends. Or maybe one and a half. Pat, one whole friend, is about the best human being alive, but has a... sh\*t ton of friends. She's friends with literally everyone. SO I'm no one special to her, really. And she's there for me when it gets really bad with my mom, but I know she's just done with listening to me whine about everything all the time.

The worst of all, though, is my brain. It's pretty useless, really. And losing fights with your own brain every day sucks. I have literally no social skills - which makes working in groups a nightmare, as well as having a decent conversation with anyone besides my two friends. No one ever likes me and I can see exactly why. And I always tell myself: new year/school, new start. I'm going to change. And I never do. I'm terrified of people, I had a literal panic attack on the bus on my way to school once, but only once, so I can't really make too much of a big deal out of it - but I think it gives you an idea of it. And comunicating with them... it's like trying to hold a conversation with someone from across the street. You can see each other alright, but the fun begins when you start trying to talk. Just not possible. I ended up with my wHoLe class hating me after... maybe 2 months. Ridiculous.

And, as I mentioned earlier, I'm failing most of my classes. My parents are pissed (I don't care about mom, but it sucks that my dad can't see that supporting me might just be better than yelling at me). Everyone in class hates me. I have no emotional support, not from Pat (I eventually stopped texting her when things got bad - so like every 10 minutes - because even with my 0 social skills I can see how much of a burden I'm being), definitely not from my parents. I'm stressed about literally everything to a ridiculous extent - I'm failing group project after group project because I can't make myself even respond to my classmates' texts without panicking. My favourite teacher whom I adore just wrote me an email and I'm not even going to read it in the next few hours but I can tell she's pissed at me. I spend most of my days stressing my brains out in the darkest pit of self loathing, depression TM and so on.

And I can't see any hope for myself. I'm completely useless. I have no one who really loves me. I'm too ashamed of myself to go with my dad to see my family tomorrow (I've seen them 2 times in my life and they're really good people but COME ON, I'm not making another group of decent human being hate me). I've been thinking about just killing myself for a... long time, but it was always just a thought. I knew I didn't want to die, I just wanted to stop hurting. I wanted to spend some more time with Pat, finish watching Daredevil, become a writer, maybe. But today was... bad. And for the first time I realized it's not going to get better. I'm not going to change, people will always hate me, I'm going to be alone and completely friendless and every fantasy I've ever had, about life getting better, it's just not going to happen. And for a moment I felt that I could actually do it. I could actually just kill myself without too much remorse. And the thought terrified me.",t2_35rjl3fr,False,,0,False,This is going to be SO long.,[],r/SuicideWatch,False,0,,0,,False,t3_h0fkty,False,dark,0.67,,public,1,0,{},,False,[],,False,False,,{},,False,1,,False,,False,,[],{},,True,,1591838894.0,text,0,,,text,self.SuicideWatch,False,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m in one of those really good high schools where not having great grades is considered a sin. If it were up to me, I would go to some normal boring school where I can actually have some good grades without stressing my brains out every day, maybe even meet some people who I&amp;#39;m not terrified to talk to (talking to people who know exactly what they want to do in life and have straight As is pretty hard when you barely pass most of the classes), but there was no way my mom would let that happen and now that I do have a chance to change schools after the first year... I can&amp;#39;t really make myself do it. Yeah, I miss going to a normal school, but I live in Poland, English is about the only thing I&amp;#39;m good at and there&amp;#39;s no way I&amp;#39;m trading my school&amp;#39;s level of English for a class of morons who after learning for 9 years still can&amp;#39;t remember what Present Simple is for.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Speaking of my mom, she&amp;#39;s an abusive narcissistic... deeply flawed human being. I never thought I could hate anyone so much. And then there&amp;#39;s my dad who thinks he&amp;#39;s the best father in the world and doesn&amp;#39;t understand why I want to hit him in the face with my math textbook (over 400 pages) most of the time. The answer is: he does nothing but argue with her and let her pretend everything&amp;#39;s fine afterwards - and thinks he&amp;#39;s doing everything he can. The situation is more difficult with him, because I still love the idea of him. I think. I can&amp;#39;t make myself hate him like I do my mother and it&amp;#39;s awful, because once the anger fades a little I feel so guilty for ever thinking anything bad about him.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have two friends. Or maybe one and a half. Pat, one whole friend, is about the best human being alive, but has a... sh*t ton of friends. She&amp;#39;s friends with literally everyone. SO I&amp;#39;m no one special to her, really. And she&amp;#39;s there for me when it gets really bad with my mom, but I know she&amp;#39;s just done with listening to me whine about everything all the time.&lt;/p&gt;

I'm soon going to be in the adult life without any direction, any motivation, any ambition, etcetera. I have passions, don't get me wrong. I love music and I play seven instruments, I've always wanted to write music for a living, but even forgetting about how elusive it is to create a successful music career, I haven't even had the motivation to create music lately. Even doing the things I do recreationally for fun like playing video games or hanging with friends are either not enjoyable and/or bring me no happiness anymore or the enjoyment and happiness they bring is greatly diminished. I've always wanted to be something bigger than myself, somebody with a platform to share their content and their personality, but that's such a narcissistic and elusive thing to want. However, I don't see myself being happy working regular jobs for the rest of my life. I've held down one job so far, I worked at a regional retail store called Tops, and if you know of Tops, you know that they're notorious for terrible management and even worse treatment of their workers. It's essentially tainted my view of jobs and it's made it hard for me to get a new one. This and especially not knowing what I want to do after high school is very bad especially because of my family. They aren't unsupportive per se, but they're very hellbent on older ideals. The ideal that if you haven't got a job or some sort of education out of high school then you're a loser who needs to be kicked to the curb. I won't have much time to figure my shit out before a metaphorical clock ticks it's final tock, causing me to be left in the dark and most likely kicked out of the house to be on my own. 

This post got a bit all over the place, so allow me to water it down for the sake of conclusion. All in all, I'm on the edge of adult life and I'm absolutely terrified to be as such. I have no idea as to what I want to do for the rest of my life and the metaphorical clock is ticking, especially considering how my family is. I haven't had any motivation, ambition, happiness, etcetera in months and it's really effecting my quality of life in a horribly negative way. I feel like I'm destined to never do what makes me happy for a living and to only end up as a loser, being miserable and all alone as I work paycheck to paycheck just to barely be able to pay rent for a place I hate living in just so I can continue the cycle for the rest of my pathetic existence. My future looks very grim and I'm not only far from excited for it, but I'm also terribly afraid of it. Life seems as though it will never be the way I hoped it to be as a child, and when I grow up my dreams will die along with any shred of happiness I was once able to have in my youth.

First I got a girlfriend of my dreams (I thought so) but after just a couple of months I realized that she wasnt even worth my effort and I jus lost so much time chasing her, I left her, fell in depression, after some time for the first time I got into mental hospital, it wasn't a nice experience, people working there really just made my condition worse, medicine wasn't working just fucking me up more and more, so I pretended to get better just to get out of there. After I returned home in maybe 2 weeks my parents said that my mom has a 4th stage cancer, I was shocked, terrified but at least I had somebody to be strong, oh I also forgot to mention that I dropped my uni, so I kind of tried to be as positive at home as I could but deep inside I was pretty fucked up, I started drinking more and more, I didn't have a job for some time but then my father kind of made a proposition to come work in the place he works as a nightshift security officer of some kind, I aggreed as I didn't really have better things to do as I didn't want to sit home drinking and upsetting my mother seing me drunk as at that time all my friends turned my back on me. After some time I started to get in contact with some of people that I kind of knew, we became friends, I had a job so I had money and you know, I had a chance to drink again, to feel happy in effect of that shitty fluid. So after some time happened what I feared the most, my mother died.. and I was out drinking at the moment it happened, it was so bad but in shock I didn't really understood anything, I just remember that I instantly sobered up and the next thing was that I kind of remember was that I was at home standing near the body of my dead mother, seeing her last time. Surprisingly I didn't take that really hard at the start, I kind of fooled myself that everything is fine and it worked for some time, I even returned to university and partied with my friends but then instantly bam, it all hit me, I dropped my uni again, I started seeing psichiatrist again and the next thing I know is I am back at mental hospital, another this time but even worse. The same scheme happened, I pretended that i miraculously got better, I got out of it. I should mention that to this date I was still living with my father and it wasn't nice, he didn't drink any alcohol and pretty much lived the live of a saint because he had to take care of my little brother that he and my mother had (he was like 3 at that time), I was living a fucked up life, being in the company with some of really fucked up people and that kind of made me more and more like that, drinking didn't stop, I even started smoking and the time I was at home i was pretty much arguing with my father because of all the stupid stuff I did and he had to pull me out of dumb situations of course. So we lived like that for almost a year. My father actually set up a charity for the healing process of my mother, as medicine was ridiculously expensive and as I mother died, he was left with a good sum of money and he decided to give it to people with similar condition to my money, he somehow found 4 people in our country and gave it to them, he kind of got in a personal relationship with one of the people, a woman, at first he was trying just to help her because all of the close people of hers turned their back on her because of the illness, they kind of fell in love but her condition didnt get better, so my father took her in our home to take care of her, as people in that condition need a lot of help. And we had a long conversation and he asked me to move to our other flat as it wasnt big for all of us, I accepted as I thought it would also would be good for our relationship and I really liked the woman and fell bad for her, I wanted her end to be with the man that deeply cared for her. She died after a year, my father got his heart broken. I felt really bad too, as my relationship with father got much better and we kind of bonded again. I started to get back on my feet again, I started drinking less and stopped doing lots of stupid shit, after some time I started college, I am still there, just finished 2 year, doing very good actually, I like it there. But still my life was pretty up and down. I got my weight down to pretty acceptable level as I was obese, actually I got pretty good results.

Note: I'm not sure if the sub is for what i've written below, but i'll just post it in case it does good for anybody. Or for me... 

This is my explanation and reasons on why i want to get killed by my own hands. I need help i guess (?). It's long, don't have to read it all, every point is divided by paragraphs. With that said... 

I've coping with this for a while now... My dad is a perfectionist jap normie living in the 80's who is also braindead and animalistic (doesn't do drugs, to my knowledge), my mom supports me and loves me, my friends, most family members and schoolmates also care about me but that's it.  I can't believe that my dead grandparents were the exact opposite of what my dad and his siblings are right now. 

The fact that only the people that i'm closer with are the only ones that have an impact on something bad i do and instead of telling me what to do and how to improve, they just tell me how shitty and how bad i'm doing... Great job, the fact that i still care can explain why i still care about my life. But still, i have 18 years living in this world and i have sworn to god (I'm religious) that i will not drink, do drugs or lust myself in any physical way, but i kind of want to do it on these ""hard days"".

 And i say ""hard days"" because my dad (main culprit) is the one making the house a kingdom for him. He doesn't hit nobody, but yells at everything and everyone... even at my cat... He has threatened to throw the cat of the window because of common problems like pissing on the floor and more things that cat owners deal with when they had just *rescued* a cat. He seems to be the most affected one by the quarantine since he is losing his mind over my mom not doing dinner when there is a LOT of food in the fridge... Social distancing and the effects of it in boomer dads... No respect for women and also not cares about his son's school life, he just worries about me representing him in a good way. 

And my aunt... another reason to cut my ears, yes my ears, because i've never seen anything bad from her, just HEARD. She doesn't yell, she just complains and does nothing else than play smart when she is the one just telling me that i made mistakes, EVEN when she knows that i recognize my failures. I've never made a mistake two times when it comes to general stuff like working a mid time job or even at school. I've even gotten flawless grades when i was in middle school, but my dad and his siblings had never said anything about how good i was at school, in highschool i dropped grades ONLY the first year, after that i've been getting average-slightly top average grades. 
Now it's my last year and my dad has never worried about my school, and hasn't assisted to any of the school events or my promotion events. But he worries about my sister, A LOT, but it's not my sister fault so she really isn't a culprit since she even feels like shit for being treated as a spoiled brat.

The main culprit of my suicidal thoughs are these two people that i've ranted about here... these two led me to have suicidal thoughs since 7 YEARS OLD...
I've started thinking that my mom was breed by my dad like if it was a ritual to have born a baby that will ""represent the family and it will be perfect"" made by my whole japanese family, I'm half jap half dominican, and you may know that dominicans are easy going... japs are not... Thanks to my dad i'm racist to a part of MY RACE, a part of me that i wish i wasn't born with it. My aunt and dad tell me to do something on the weekends because i can't just be chilling, ""i gotta do something cuz the weekends i ain't doing nothing!"" Guess what shittard, THAT'S WHAT WEEKENDS ARE FOR.  
I wanna chop my head off.

I said i was a religious person, but my jap family seems to be following some sort of japanese quoran who they sworn their lives and have pride for. 
We live in DR and i don't even know why are they still here... they hate dominicans, blacks, latinos... MAN just fuck off! 
Why are they still here!? You don't like it GO AWAY! I know my dad and my aunt have enough money to go to another country and get stable there. I guess they are scared of failure... gives me conniptions... 

I'm a very philosophycal person and i like to see things from different prespectives, my 
family doesn't give a damn what i study as long ad it's something to be proud of, and have good money... I can't be an artist because ""it doesn't require me to assist in an university, therefore it's  stupid! "".  Very funny... 
Today i left my """" job"""" assisting teachers to 'teach' japanese to kids because i just couldn't bear with it... they said they needed me, my dad put me in, but in the video conferences i was just there to... be there... yeah, just my presence... and before the quarantine i just yelling at kids to shut up and that's it... My dad says i was stealing their money after the quarantine started because i didn't do nothing. Guess what retard, i wasn't doing nothing either before quarantine. I was gaining 4000RD$ (100US$ aprox) per month approximately, shitty af. 

If i have a minor injury none of my dad and his siblings will care, they comment about it and call that ""care"". 
My dad has a back injury and he goes to a ""doctor"" who he doesn't even know if it's really a doctor and calls it a ""treatment"". I Hope he dies from those injections... 

I cure my seemingly severe depression and 'family social anxiety' by hypnotizing myself with videogames, masturbation, videos, reddit (duh) and even scary stuff. But i still get somewhere close to PTSD where i just get a mental outburst of me having suicidal thoughts. 

How come the only nightmares i remember, had my dad and aunt yelling at me and me waking up with an adrenaline rush through my body. 

My dad once tried to cure a severe back pain i had with acupuncture... one year has passed and now i have weird ball in my back, but it doesn't hurt ""so i guess it's ok!"". My dad refused to go to a doctor, and  when i got struck by 'dengue' a year ago, good lord he cared about me... he went to the hospital, just to talk about how weak i was going to be after i get out of the hospital and that i will need a lot of exercise.
 Just let me kill myself. 

I've been living with my dad for my whole 18 years... and i don't even know who/what he is... 

My aunt just wants the best of me, but when i do something wrong, she despises me and doesn't tell me to correct my mistakes, instead she just yells to me that i made the mistakes that i already knew i made. Therefore making it worse. 

Two bullies in the form of family members... they say we kids need to get spanked but they had actually never been spanked before. (according to my dead grandfather, who was very honest). 

God save this world and end it all please. 
Save the holy beings and bring hell to the trash who contaminate this form of existence...

In short: My dad and my aunt are two ignorants who had made my life impossible. 

 
I'm not killing myself because there are people who still care about me... but if the people who i mentioned still in this world by the time i finish collegue... i would not know what to do.
