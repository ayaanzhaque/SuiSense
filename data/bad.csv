"Our most-broken and least-understood rules is ""helpers may not invite private contact as a first resort"", so we've made a new wiki to explain it","We understand that most people who reply immediately to an OP with an invitation to talk privately  mean only to help, but this type of response usually leads to either disappointment or disaster.  it usually works out quite differently here than when you say ""PM me anytime"" in a casual social context.  

We have huge admiration and appreciation for the goodwill and good citizenship of so many of you who support others here and flag inappropriate content - even more so because we know that so many of you are struggling yourselves.  We're hard at work behind the scenes on more information and resources to make it easier to give and get quality help here - this is just a small start.  

Our new wiki page explains in detail why it's much better to respond in public comments, at least until you've gotten to know someone.  It will be maintained at /r/depression/wiki/private_contact, and the full text of the current version is below.

*****

###Summary###

**Anyone who, while acting as a helper, invites or accepts private contact (I.e. PMs, chat, or any kind of offsite communication) early in the conversion is showing either bad intentions or bad judgement.  Either way, it's unwise to trust them.** 


""PM me anytime"" seems like a kind and generous offer. And it might be perfectly well-meaning, but, unless and until a solid rapport has been established, it's just not a wise idea.  Here are some points to consider before you offer or accept an invitation to communicate privately.

* **By posting supportive replies publicly, you'll help more people than just the OP. If your responses are of good quality, you'll educate and inspire other helpers.** [The 1-9-90 rule](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1%25_rule_(Internet_culture\)) applies here as much as it does anywhere else on the internet.  

* People who are struggling with serious mental-health issues often (justifiably) have a low tolerance for disappointment and a high-level of ever-changing emotional need. **Unless the helper is able to make a 100% commitment to be there for them in every way, for as long as necessary, offering a personal inbox as a resource is likely to do more harm than good.** This is why mental-health crisis-line responders usually don't give their names and callers aren't allowed to request specific responders.  It's much healthier and safer for the callers to develop a relationship with the agency as a whole.  Analogously, it's much safer and healthier for our OPs to develop a relationship with the community as a whole.  Even trained responders are generally not allowed to work high-intensity situations alone.  It's partly about availability, but it's mostly about wider perspective and preventing compassion fatigue. 

* **If a helper gets in over their head with someone whose mental-health issues (including suicidality, which is often comorbid with depression) escalate, in a PM conversation it's much harder for others, including the /r/depression and /r/SuicideWatch moderators to help**.  (Contrary to common assumptions, moderators can't see or police PMs.)  

* In our observation over many years, the people who say ""PM me"" the most are consistently the ones with the least understanding of mental-health issues and mental-health support. We all have gaps in our knowledge and in our ability to communicate effectively.  Community input mitigates these limitations. **There's no reason why someone who's truly here to help would want to hide their responses from community scrutiny**.  If helpers are concerned about their own privacy, keep in mind that self-disclosure, when used supportively, is more about the feelings than the details, and that we have no problem here with the use of alt/throwaway accounts, and have no restrictions on account age or karma.  

*  We all know the internet is used by some people to exploit or abuse others.  These people *do* want to hide their deceptive and manipulative responses from everyone except their victims. There are many of them who specifically target those who are vulnerable because of mental-health issues. **If a helper invites an OP to talk privately and gives them a good, supportive experience, they've primed that person to be more vulnerable to abusers.** This sort of cognitive priming tends to be particularly effective when someone's in a state of mental-health crisis, when people rely more on heuristics than critical reasoning.

* If OPs want to talk privately, posting on a wide-open anonymous forum like reddit might not be the best option. Although we don't recommend it, we do allow OPs to request private contact when asking for support. If you want to do this, please keep your expectations realistic, and to have a careful look at the history of anyone who offers to PM before opening up to them.",SQLwitch,133,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/doqwow/our_mostbroken_and_leastunderstood_rules_is/,understand people reply immediately op invitation talk privately mean help type response usually lead either disappointment disaster usually work quite differently say pm anytime casual social context huge admiration appreciation goodwill good citizenship many support others flag inappropriate content even know many struggling hard work behind scene information resource make easier give get quality help small start new wiki page explains detail much better respond public comment least gotten know someone maintained r depression wiki private_contact full text current version summary anyone acting helper invite accepts private contact e pm chat kind offsite communication early conversion showing either bad intention bad judgement either way unwise trust pm anytime seems like kind generous offer might perfectly well meaning unless solid rapport ha established wise idea point consider offer accept invitation communicate privately posting supportive reply publicly help people op response good quality educate inspire helper 1 9 90 rule http en wikipedia org wiki 1 25_rule_ internet_culture applies much doe anywhere else internet people struggling serious mental health issue often justifiably low tolerance disappointment high level ever changing emotional need unless helper able make 100 commitment every way long necessary offering personal inbox resource likely harm good mental health crisis line responder usually give name caller allowed request specific responder much healthier safer caller develop relationship agency whole analogously much safer healthier ops develop relationship community whole even trained responder generally allowed work high intensity situation alone partly availability mostly wider perspective preventing compassion fatigue helper get head someone whose mental health issue including suicidality often comorbid depression escalate pm conversation much harder others including r depression r suicidewatch moderator help contrary common assumption moderator see police pm observation many year people say pm consistently one least understanding mental health issue mental health support gap knowledge ability communicate effectively community input mitigates limitation reason someone truly help would want hide response community scrutiny helper concerned privacy keep mind self disclosure used supportively feeling detail problem use alt throwaway account restriction account age karma know internet used people exploit abuse others people want hide deceptive manipulative response everyone except victim many specifically target vulnerable mental health issue helper invite op talk privately give good supportive experience primed person vulnerable abuser sort cognitive priming tends particularly effective someone state mental health crisis people rely heuristic critical reasoning ops want talk privately posting wide open anonymous forum like reddit might best option although recommend allow ops request private contact asking support want please keep expectation realistic careful look history anyone offer pm opening,broken least understood rule helper may invite private contact first resort made new wiki explain,sql witch

"I hate it so much when you try and express your feelings to your parents, but they turn it around and compare your suffering with theirs.","I've been feeling really depressed and lonely lately from my job, I'm a full time late night janitor for a courthouse just 10 miles away from my hometown. Working there has been pretty easy, but I wound up feeling super lonely a lot considering I don't really get to talk to my friends or hang out with them much.

So just today I came home late as usual, and I have a little interaction with my mom after she made a joke to me that I took pretty personal and felts like was more of an insult rather than a sense of humor. I told her that I didn't really want to joke around like that, but she refused to listen and told me to just go away then. Despite attempting to change the topic and explain why I haven't been feeling so high, all she kept doing was telling what a great mom she is for raising me and my brother while struggling to make ends meet and keep the house. What an ungrateful little bastard I am for not appreciating her hard work and sacrifices. 

At that moment I was legitimately about to begin to cry. But rather instead of pausing and trying to reverse the damages, all my mom did was host a little parental style of the oppression Olympics and proclaim her amount of tears and cries over the course of three weeks. I got out just before my first tear would legitimately run down my cheek. 

And even before I went to bed, she goes on about how her life is more worse than ours than ours, then escalates into a more ""This is why you'd make a terrible mistake getting behind the wheel"" considering I had practice driving this morning. Unaware that she had just lite the fuse to trigger the firework, but she didn't seem to care. 

Thanks for reading, I hope you feel better soon and find the key to unlocking your next set of happiness.

This world has no place for people like me.,"A bit of context. I'm an American. I'm black. I'm big. I'm ugly. And I'm autistic. I work as an aircraft mechanic.

The more I go through every day, the less I see the point of continuing with this life. No one who's gotten to know me as a person wants anything to do with me. People make fun of my quirks all the time - they think they're being funny, but they're being obnoxious. Besides that, the only friends I still have are the ones in high school, who are now so far away. My father, the man who cared about me more than anyone else did, passed away a few years ago from sudden heart and kidney failure, while I was waiting on a connecting flight to visit him.

Besides that, people will only connect with me as much as they need to. I clearly have problems that I do not know how to address. No amount of therapy has fixed those issues.

People cross the street when they see me on the sidewalk. Society here in general doesn't like people like me, with so many people supporting an openly racist president as we regress. I know that I won't ever be able to rely on the cops for anything, because I'm likely to get shot before they figure out what the issue is. I've been racially profiled many times when I lived in New York City. I happened to be stopped for every ""random"" drug search whenever I took the Staten Island ferry while carrying a backpack.

That being the case, the only value of any sort I can provide to society is in the job I do. I'm also doing vocational training for a higher qualification, but every day I'm questioning more and more why I care. More money isn't going to fix me as a person.

The truth is, I'm a mistake. I learned a few years ago that I was adopted at birth. Probably before my new parents knew I would be as difficult as I was. I should've been aborted or left to die.

The prognosis for our world grows more dire every day due to global warming facilitated by old people who don't give a shit about us. There is no reason to believe things will get better - people reject science more and more, and we are going backwards.

Before long, I will have a gun. It will allow me to protect myself where I know law enforcement won't. But it'll also give me the power to choose when I want to die. That, at the very least, will give me peace of mind - knowing I have a way out whenever I need it.

I'm not some ""starving kid in Africa"" or whatever other bullshit people push to those who are discontented, but I have still been dealt a pretty shitty hand in life. I see no reason to keep bothering with it when so many things are wrong with me, and our future will only get worse.",InsertANameHeree,2,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/fegd6t/this_world_has_no_place_for_people_like_me/,bit context american black big ugly autistic work aircraft mechanic go every day le see point continuing life one gotten know person want anything people make fun quirk time think funny obnoxious besides friend still one high school far away father man cared anyone else passed away year ago sudden heart kidney failure wa waiting connecting flight visit besides people connect much need clearly problem know address amount therapy ha fixed issue people cross street see sidewalk society general like people like many people supporting openly racist president regress know ever able rely cop anything likely get shot figure issue racially profiled many time lived new york city happened stopped every random drug search whenever took staten island ferry carrying backpack case value sort provide society job also vocational training higher qualification every day questioning care money going fix person truth mistake learned year ago wa adopted birth probably new parent knew would difficult wa aborted left die prognosis world grows dire every day due global warming facilitated old people give shit u reason believe thing get better people reject science going backwards long gun allow protect know law enforcement also give power choose want die least give peace mind knowing way whenever need starving kid africa whatever bullshit people push discontented still dealt pretty shitty hand life see reason keep bothering many thing wrong future get worse,world ha place people like,insert name e
I’m not even worthy of being counted during attendance.,"I go to a small school, normally no more than 20 students are in a classroom, yet my teachers don’t even realize I’m in their class most of the time. I have amazing teachers, and they always want to help students learn, but I’m always forgotten about. I’m not slow enough to need special help, I’m not smart enough to need no help though. I’m pretty quiet, and I almost always get interrupted by loud people. If I actually work up the nerve to ask a question in my asshole-filled classes, the teacher gets distracted by two idiots trying to kill each other and forgets about me. 

I know I probably sound like a spoiled child that just wants attention, but I don’t.

"8 years ago, I posted here, wanting to die. My life is so much better now.","When I was 15-16 years old, I posted here in my darkest moments. I couldn't see any reason to keep living. I thought I was nothing special and the next 8 years seemed like an endless slog. You can look through my post history if you want. 

Since then, I graduated college and graduate school. I have traveled the world. I swam with bioluminescent algae in Indonesia. I've hiked among alpacas in Peru. I learned to speak Spanish fluently and connected with people around the world and in my own country, who speak Spanish too. I've published my writing i  multiple publications. I have fallen in love and had my heart broken several times. I realized I'm gay, came out, and I'm with the most amazing woman. I have a career that I love where I help people every day. I can honestly say that depression may be a lifelong struggle for me, but it is possible to recover and develop tools to cope with it. Every day is a manageable challenge now. Every day I am grateful to just be alive. I am SO GLAD that I didn't kill myself 8 years ago. I never would have known how beautiful my life could become.

Before you think about killing yourself, remember that you don't know how beautiful your life could become. How could you? You have no way of knowing until you get there.

I was never the popular kid. I was known but never popular. I was the kid that got picked last for sports or games, never got to play soccer with the other kids because I wasnt good enough, wasnt included in tag or hide and go seek, but I pressed on not knowing what the other kids were bullying me. I got to play lego or slap jack, tic tac toe, you name it, I played by myself. I had about 3 or 4 friends for most of primary school (kindergarten-grade 3). Not knowing how to interact with the other kids I was lonely. I didnt realize I was lonely as it was well normal for me. The world was out to get me and I let it, I had no voice. I didnt know how to stand up to myself for fear of hurting the other person for telling them how I felt. I was never taught how to show emotions or how to use them. Interpret them. I know what they look like and how they feel but showing them? Using them? You'd have better luck getting a volcano to spew water. But this is how I was brought up and its what I knew. Life for me was like looking through beer goggles for everyone else it was distorted and I had a fake image of what it was. Because of this I matured faster in other aspects of life. I grasped adult concepts earlier than most and grew into them. Into worrying about what others think of me, always comparing myself to EVERYONE else, not just the best or the people above me but everyone. I felt like everyone hated me and thought I was some annoying kid so I shut myself off from the world. That's the first few years of life. I ran around as a ""happy"" lonely kid. As I grew up and was about 10 or 11 I learned to read people and guess what they were feeling/thinking, how their day was going n shit. I learned to feed off of everyone's emotions around me rather than feeling my own. I essentially shut off my own emotions without realizing it and now I'm struggling with fixing it. I fed off of the kids that were happy and replicated their happiness as my own, I imitated them and copied them to feel included. I grew up like this trying to fill that big empty lonely hole I felt, i buried it deep down and (as a green swamp friend of mine once said) I became an onion, I made layers to try to hide it but nothing seemed to work. (Sorry this post has kinda became a pity party it was not my Intention, fuck it let's continue) the next couple years of my life pretty much continued on like this, building my wall of fake emotions to ""protect"" everyone else from my greatest enemy... myself, I didnt trust myself to not fuck up, didnt trust myself to really connect with anyone. I lied to everyone around me and pushed anyone away that tried to get close or learn who really was on the inside. It was repulsive and wrong but I didnt know that. I would say this is when I got my first taste of depression around the age of 12. Grades 5-7 I was the class runt/Guinne pig/doormat, I was the kid being bullied. The other kids unanimously decided I was the kid they picked on. Fucking private religious bullshit school did nothing to prevent what they were doing to me nor did they seem to care hell even the TEACHERS  would pick on me. So I accepted ""who I was"" and that was the school fuck up. I tried to take their name tag and wear it with pride. Yea it worked for a bit as armor. I made myself insensitive to the bullying for the first little bit. But grade 6 is when the smack down really started to happen and I became... the germ. These kids had gotten the idea to give me the permanent cheese touch or the germ as they liked to call it. This was the tipping point for me. All my so called classmates and friends I had suddenly turned on me and I was alone. Truly alone, left half dead for the vultures to pick at. I broke. I broke into so many little pieces, all those people I grew up around people I trusted turned. I couldn't touch anyone with out them screaming ""DONT TOUCH ME GERM"" ""GREAT THANKS NOW I HAVE TO WASH MYSELF"" and other hurtful shit like that. They couldn't even sit in a chair I had used without washing it and sanitizing it. Okay I say I was alone but I had 2 friends, payton and dane, they tried to help they tried everything they could but the other kids wouldn't back down. Half way thru the school year I attempted suicide. I had the steak knife pointed at my heart and started pushing, I drew a little blood but it hurt to much so I stuck around. I had only told dane and he kept it quite for a while like I asked him to but one day he told me that he had to tell the teacher, it wasnt something he liked knowing and didnt like how close I was to not being here. So he told that I wasnt feeling good in my head, that I was going thru some tough times due to the class and what they were doing. This teacher had 0 clue that it was happening and immediately went to the principal. Brought me with her and told me to tell her what was going on. I played dumb for so long hoping that it would just end. I didnt want to deal with it but they persisted and eventually brought dane in and asked him what was up. After he started to say something I broke, I told them almost everything. About me wanting to die, not wanting to live and how I wished everyone else would die first. I didnt tell them how i had attempted suicide. My worst fears had come true, I spoke up and now everyone hated me. They couldn't bully me but did they hate me. After the whole class got a ripped a new ass hole for pushing a kid to suicidal thoughts (yes I told them I had thoughts, no I didnt tell them I tried) I came back into the class room and I'm greeted with silence and stone cold eyes staring back at me. The first thing this kid told me (who I thought was one of the people that I had as an acquaintance) ""You know OP fuck you, you go and cry to the principal that we dont treat you nicely well guess what? You want us to treat you with dignity and respect well how about trying to treat us that way? Next time think before you speak"". I can't tell you how much this affected me. That kid got sent home for the rest of the week. This is supposed to be where that part of the story ends right? No those fuckers came back the next and kept calling me the germ, kept bullying me and bullied me harder than before. Grade 7 was a repeat of grade 6. Aging more and more I hid more and more of my emotions and just kept feeding off others and relying on them for how to react in different situations. Elementary school behind me and moving to middle school I made new friends, a new chapter in life. Friendsthat didnt judge, one guy even had the same name as me ""mysteriouslyreddited"". I started to notice girls at this point too. Two girls in particular, quinn and Anna. Quinn is a couple years younger than I had been babysat by my mother and I by her mother, they switched out as they both worked. And she, well Quinn's amazing, pretty no beautiful, shes got these eyes that just, her hair... wow. And her smile (._. ) just everything. She was my first crush although quickly forgotten (we went to different schools. You know out of sight out of mind. K not like that but I hadn't seen her in a while). Anna on the other had, well I can describe her similarly, but things were different with anna. They were. Easier??? Its. Well she was the girl I fell head over heels for and she knew it. We talked for hours upon hours but it was never meant to be. I continued on the same way I did in elementary school, by wearing armor and growing my onion. Anna and I stayed close for a couple years me being wrapped around her finger while she went after other guys. I got her a couple boyfriends reluctantly, I Introduced her to a couple guys I knew she was crushing on and I enjoyed watching her be with them (as i look back i was feeding off of her boyfriends emotions and mixed them with my own. Bad idea 0/10 would recommend.) And well this went as well as you may guess, it went great. WRONG. I was confused and shut off, shut down and shot down. I don't remember what started a fight between us but it went on for months. It became personal for the both of us. I told her not to come to my funeral she told me to fuck off and go die, words were said damage was done and I thought I was okay with it. I learned quickly that I in fact was not okay and my fight with her had broken my armour and I was bare, everything was out and we both fell into depression because of what we did to each other. I was having more and more suicidal thoughts. I had spiraled to my lowest point that I've ever been, self harm, alchohol, skipping school, it was the worst part of my life. Highschool is the hardest for everyone isnt it?? Its not oof my bad. I was skipping school, fighting with my mothers husband, smoking pot and drinking waaaaay to much booze. The fall out of not having anna in my life was ruining me, yes I felt for her and yes i wanted her back in my life but the hatred for her at the same time was almost outweighing the good I felt for her. I cut everyday for over 2 years. I didnt know what to do, the pain felt good and brought me out of my head and prevented me about thinking about anything as long as the blade was on me. My entire depressive episode was brought on because I couldn't stand up for myself or tell myself it's okay or when to stop. I lost myself, lost my armor, lost everything. Or at least I thought I lost everything when in reality I was only just discovering life. I became cold and truly shut off my emotions and didnt even feed off others. I became a robot. I woke up late went to school skipped all my classes, went home played COD or skyrim and went to bed. Rinse repeat and that's how I lived from day to day, month to month, for a couple years. I still haven't reconnected with anna (anna if you end up reading this im sorry for the bad memories. I like to think that we still have some love left for each other but i know that's false). As I lived like this my family life started to become stretched and strained. Being brought up as a christian I was told to believe in god, that hes the answer to all and just ask him for help. I called bullshit and that if he truly cared that none of us would suffer, if we suffer then why the fuck did jesus die on the cross for us? My grandparents and mother didnt take kindly to these words and how dare I speak about god in that manor. After mass one sunday i would have been like 15 we were at the grandparents and the topic of vacations came up and how I hadn't been on one in years and I'd like to go when peeps went down to visit cousins from another town a days drive away. It was spring break and they were leaving next weekend. I inquired if I could go with them and because of my grades I was told no. I told them if they let me go I'd pick up the pace in school and i would try, but only if they let me go. Well my attitude needed to be fixed because the next thing I know my mother is yelling at me and telling me how entitled I am and that Id be lucky to consider even going. Me being the teen I was I yelled back. Fuck yous were exchanged. My grandfather had enough and tried to manhandle me, no fucking chance gramps not in my current state. We had a fist fight that ended up with him having broken glasses, he litterally ripped my shirt off me, ripped my necklace off and threw me into a door and him thrown onto the floor. He got up and started to yell ""get the fuck out of here, you can come back when your damn well ready to apologize until then get out!!!!"". I replied with ""well then I guess it wasnt nice knowing you. When you're ready to get your grandson back track me down and tell me how sorry you are"" and left without looking back. He did track me down the next day and told me he was sorry about how he reacted and stepping so far out of line. That night after we made up and got a blizzard I went home to find my mother's husband fuming because of how I talked to my mother which cause a fight with him. That was the night I lost my home, my family, he had disowned me and cast me out like garbage. Even tho that was one of my lowest points I didnt see it as a loss. Yea i was fucked but i was also free to do what I want when I want. So I started working on myself. I moved to a new city enrolled in a new school and started fresh. While I did climb out of my depressing hole I have yet to beat depression. I got a great girlfriend and living large now adays . Started some anti depressants, counseling and what not. Well now Im gonna skip ahead to why I wanted to get some baggage off my back. A few weeks ago I went out to the bar with some friends and I ran into none other than quinn. I'd had some pregame drinks, had some drinks while I was there. I didnt eat anything that day, was already dehydrated and alcohol should not be consumed like that while on meds. So I was already drunk, feeling great, I'd seen quinn once and didnt know what to say so I just smiled and ""ignored"" her. Well let me tell you it was so fucking hard to ignore her. I mean if you were me you'd find it impossible to. So I did what any drunk man does, i had a shot and approached her, asked if I could buy her a drink and  From what I remember we hit it off. I had a blast but tbh I was not looking for anything in her I just remembe how I used to feel but more Importantly j remembered all the fun times we use to have growing up and all the memories with her over the years. I was.. no i am lonely and she seemed to just kinda be there. So we were talking, and I looked at her and time just seemed to stop. We talked but I don't remember what it was about. At one point I asked if I could kiss her. My self conscience was screaming at me telling me this was not okay but the alchohol was in too deep. There is so much that I wish I could remember about that night but I cant. I dont know what happened what I said or did. This is the hardest I've had to fight this depression in a long time and this time I'm worried that I won't be able to win. I don't recognize who I am anymore. I dont like this person I've become. I love my GF but I feel like I'm going to drag her down and make her depressed like me. I feel like I'm not good enough for her and I'm hurting her by being with her. I cant stop thinking about quinn but I think I fucked up even trying to be friends with her. There was a small spark there but nothing major besides I dont want there to be a spark right now, I've talked to my GF and she knows I have feelings for another. It was hard to deal with at first but after we talked about it she knows that im struggling with my feelings and that I'm not looking for a way to leave her. I've been on the verge of relapsing and going back to self harm. Im not crossing that line because when I do there's no turning back. Im tired of being depressed and I want out but he hardest part is figuring out who i am and if I can keep all my current bridges or if I have to go out and build new bridges. Im gonna keep trudging on and finding my way thru this fucked up place we call earth. Again im sorry this was so long and all over the place, if you read it thanks for listening, if you skip over this story thanks for not wasting your time (that came out wrong but ov well). I'm not looking for help I just need to talk to someone. I am doing okay I just had so much pent up I needed a release.

Just an advice :),"Watch After Life on Netflix. 
Story of a man (played by Ricky Gervais) who lost his beloved wife and just wants to kill himself.

Letter from my girlfriend,"&amp;#x200B;

My girlfriend wrote me this letter and agreed to share it here... 

&amp;#x200B;

Letter to my depressed lover.

I see you. I know you’re in there. The man who loved and sought joy, the man who felt

deserving of happiness. He is blindfolded, held hostage, cold and chained in a windowless

basement, by a tyrant who thrives off suffering. At times it feels like there is no hope, at

times it feels like there is no escape. You are weakened, the exhaustion has taken over your

body, your mind and your soul, you question whether you’ll ever be strong enough to fight

this mighty tyrant, to escape from his grip, out of the darkness. Will you ever be able to feel

the sun stroking your skin again? Will you ever see the light again? Will you ever feel love

again?

Why are you here? How did you get here? You never asked for this, no one would.

A tyrant is an illegitimate ruler who controls through oppression. Tyranny is not fair, it is not

understanding, and it is cruel. The tyrant wants to weaken you until you have no choice but

to succumb, he will brainwash you until you come to terms with his reign, until you are no

longer a threat to him. The tyrant wants you to think that he is too strong to ever beat, too

mighty to outthink, too present to escape.

But let me tell you something about Tyrants. Anger, hate, always stems from fear, and pain.

Behind every tyrant is a hurt child. Behind every tyrant is a voice that was once unheard, a

heart that was once broken, eyes that were once blinded. The tyrant doesn’t want you to

see the light, because the light was once taken from him, he doesn’t want you to know love,

because love was once taken from him, and he wants you to hurt, because he hurts.

But how can tyranny be defeated? When tyranny is defeated by force, it often just paves

the way for another form of tyranny. You don’t want to kill your tyrant, you’ll be left with

blood on your hands and trauma in your soul, if you kill you’ll have to hide, and what is the

point of fighting your way out of the darkness, just to make your way into another form of

darkness?

No. Your tyrant won’t be defeated by force. He will be defeated by love, and I know that

your love is strong enough to turn him around.

The man that I love finds joy in the little things, the touch of the grass against his feet, the

sight of birds in the trees, the sound of a stick falling on icy water. The man that I love is

surprising, he is unapologetically original, passionate, and doted of a natural humour. The

man that I love is caring and has an emotional intelligence that can make anyone around

him feel seen, heard, and loved. The man that I love is wise, he can offer advice that you

never knew you needed, and he can be the ray of sunshine in anyone’s day. The man that I

love will lighten up entire rooms and soothe even your deepest worries with care and

attention. The man that I love, can love so strongly, so unconditionally, so powerfully, that

he can make anyone’s darkness fade away. So, if anyone is going to bring this tyrant down,

it will be the man that I love.

Love can make your tyrant feel seen, it can make him feel comfortable enough to talk,

comfortable enough to tell you about what pain led him to tyranny. When faced with love,

with a powerful, unconditional love, and an acceptance that is free of all judgment, your

&amp;#x200B;

tyrant will be able to start facing up to his actions, he will be able to start realising that all

along he was causing you to suffer for reasons that had nothing to do with you, they were

never your fault, he was only causing you to suffer, because he was suffering. When that

realisation will spring upon him, he will remove your blindfold and you will see that you are

facing yourself. But don’t worry, it’s just a mask the tyrant originally wore to trouble you, he

won’t wish to do that anymore though, he’ll unchain you and remove his mask, and you will

realise that all along, your tyrant was only a child. Suddenly the anger you felt towards your

tyrant will vanish, because you are a man who is fair, just and loving, you are a man who

doesn’t believe in punishment nor revenge, you are a man who can forgive. You are a man

who can recognise when a child simply needs to be held, loved and nurtured.

So you will take the child’s hand. At first, he will be fearful, he has been hurt before, who’s

to say that you won’t hurt him? But you will give him your word, you will promise him that

he is safe with you, and deep in your heart, you will know that you are telling the truth. The

child will weep in your arms, and you will hold him tighter, you will tell him that he is loved,

he is heard, he is seen, and that from this moment forward, he will never be alone.

You will come out of the basement with the child, hand in hand. And although at first it will

feel like a relief, it won’t be easy. You haven’t seen the sun in so long, its light will feel

blinding and uncomfortable, your body will still feel weak, and as you’ll barely feel able to

look after yourself, you’ll start to wonder how you could possibly look after this child? But

you will surprise yourself. Through the small pleasures you once enjoyed, such as feeling the

cool grass underneath your feet, you will find strength. Enough strength to lift yourself up,

carry the child, and start walking. It will be challenging, and you’ll worry that each step

might be your last step, you’ll worry that you might fall and never find the strength to get

back up, but you’ll keep putting a foot in front of the other, until it starts to feel natural.

Eventually you’ll look up and realise that the sun isn’t as blinding as it was when you first

came out, you’ll see a path, and you’ll know how to get home.

On your way home, you will worry that bringing this child back might be too much of a

burden for me. What if I don’t want him? What if I don’t love him? After all he was once a

tyrant, how could I love him? And what if I don’t even love you anymore? You’ve been gone

for so long, what if I’ve stopped waiting? What if I’ve given up? What if I’ve found someone

else? What if I just end up hurting you and the child more than you’ve both already been

hurt?

But all this time, I’ve been waiting for you. I’ve been worrying, I’ve been crying, you

disappeared so suddenly I never understood what had happened. I made it my mission to

find you, I was up day and night trying to save you, I called on you a thousand times, I

searched for clues in every corner, I even tried to negotiate with your tyrant, but to no avail,

it only angered him more. I tried to get help, but no one could help me, and in the end, I was

left weakened. That’s when I realised that I was exhausting myself, and I wasn’t helping you.

So I did the only thing I could do. I stopped trying to save you and trusted that you would be

able to save yourself, and as I waited for you to do that, I held our space, I nourished our

space so that you could come back to a loving and nurturing home, one where you could

one day feel whole again and heal.

&amp;#x200B;

When you come home, I will welcome your little boy with open arms, and love him, just as I

learned to love the little girl who once held me hostage in a basement. The truth is I already

know your little boy, I’ve seen him in your shadows, and I’ve already grown to love him. You

also know my little girl, she has been living in our home throughout our entire relationship.

She has loved you as much as I have, and although at first she was afraid of you, she was

afraid that you would hurt her, she grew to love you, and she learned to trust you. When

you were gone for so long, she began to worry, she worried that perhaps you would never

come back, she worried that perhaps you didn’t want to come back to us, perhaps you

wanted another home, a different home, perhaps you had stopped loving us.

But I reassured her, and I told her about the love that we shared, the hours and days we

spent looking into each other’s eyes, as time stood still and the world around us vanished,

and we questioned, every day, how we could be so lucky. Our love is the truest love I’ve

ever known, our love is the deepest love I’ve ever known, and I know that a love like ours,

never just goes away.

One day my little girl will meet your little boy, and they will love each other as much as we

love each other, the four of us will build a home so whole, that all our fears will be replaced

by trust, our anger will be replaced by love, and tyranny will be nothing but a distant

memory.

This isn’t going to happen overnight, we don’t want you to exhaust yourself trying to come

home, we don’t want you to run and fall, we want you to make wise and calculated steps, so

that you can slowly but surely come back to us.

If I could, I would be in the basement with you, but you don’t want me there, and if I force

myself into the basement, my little girl will turn into a tyrant again and our home will

collapse. So although I’m not in the darkness with you, know that I can still see you, and I

am still here, holding our fort, waiting for you to find the strength to love your tyrant

unconditionally, so that you can bring him home for us to nurture and heal him, so that he

can learn to fearlessly trust both of us.",psst_shhh,3,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/fectqt/letter_from_my_girlfriend/,amp x200b girlfriend wrote letter agreed share amp x200b letter

Kids and depression/ Mental Illness,"I am desperate for advice on how to explain to my 11 year old son what depression is.

I just want to cry alone.,"holy shit things went bad fast. Last year I went into deep depression, however I recovered over the summer and things were seemingly looking up. I got a job, my grades were good and was hanging out with friends regularly. However the past two weeks things have went to absolute shit. My parents decided they wanted to try some ""parenting"" and decided I spent ""too much time on video games"". Even though I really only played 1-2 hours a night. It was one of the main ways I interacted with my friends as well. After that they decided that my phone was distracting me so it was confiscated as soon as I got home from school. Then they decided to take my door off the hinges to look in on me more. The worst part is i don't even know why they are doing all of this. My grades were good, A's and B's and in 6 AP classes while working 20 hours a week and maintaining a social life. Everything was going so good. Now I get home and feel empty and alone.

"I was told it gets better, 10 years later and it just got numb.","So first of all, I don't know if this is a rule or not, but I've never been to a doctor's and actually got confirmed to have depression, I have anxiety issues and likely agoraphobia, I haven't left the house for 4 years, even then it only lasted a month, since before that I hadn't left the house in 5 years. Even before that, I didn't receive a high school education as I spent it all, you guessed it, in my house.

There was a small portion in my life where I actually had friends, 10 years ago, I was active, ""fun"", enjoying my life fairly well but occasionally I was still in the dumps. Most of my friends seemed to be the same way so we talked about it a lot. Of course my friend at the time tried to encourage me, tell me it gets better and kept an eye on me to make sure I was coming out of my shell so to say.

So of course I fucked that up, I made a small mistake, said sorry, they forgave me and I punished myself by not allowing myself to see my friends. Still haven't seen them to this day, besides one, my so. Somehow, they have infinite patience and can put up with all my shit.

I punished myself a lot, I'd cut myself, I'd punch and slam myself, destroy my own possessions. My so tried their best and it sort of fizzled out. These days I don't get the will to do so anymore.

Ever since then, nothing, for a whole 10 years, most of it I didn't even spend time with my mother and younger sister. Maybe I was still punishing myself. I had few hobbies or even things to do, though I didn't fully enjoy any of it, I was starting to feel pretty emotionless.
Towards the end I actually started reconnecting with my mother and finally learning stuff and just starting to connect with my sister.

It was going fairly well for me, I was starting to look at the bright side, I still never left my house but it was starting to feel comfortable instead of a prison.

But then my sister did something unspeakable, something I don't think I could ever forgive, but my mother did, instantly. I was hurt, angry and it pulled me straight back. Ever since I've been weird around my sister, finding it almost impossible to connect and angry at my mother.

So now, I just feel numb, I really don't know what to do, I've been trying to forgive and forget but it's impossible. I've been trying to go outside but I almost have panic attacks just thinking about it sometimes. I'm back to the prison with nothing to do but wait.

Why do I still have a feeling like I’m doing everything wrong?,"These are just random things because I guess I need a hug. 


I’ve been feeling so lonely lately. I can’t do even basic stuff, like I need to motivate myself to take a shower or find reasons to eat something. I’m finally taking some medication. I still struggle with finding a job, but it’s okay I guess, kinda regret wasting all my money and not saving more. That’s like a coping mechanism. I starve myself and then feel sick again. I can’t motivate myself to workout because I don’t have any limits and I either don’t do anything or workout till I’m exhausted. I either cry a lot because of everything or feel nothing at all. I have like two friends now and my boyfriend. I appreciate them the most. But I really hate myself for not being able to have phone calls with my boyfriend(we’re in a long distance rn). I really love him and I want to change it but I can’t make myself do that?? Like he knows about my issues and he’s very patient and supportive but I have a feeling like I’m bothering him al the tome and making him feel sad because calling someone you love is like the very basic thing that can make you feel closer to each other. But that’s not the point of my post, I have no idea if it even makes sense. 



I’m so tired, I’m not feeling broken, I’m not having desire to end my life because I know that it’s just temporary and I’ll be fine. But I’m feeling extremely not motivated at all, I’m sad and I hate myself for not being productive. I’m afraid to lose my boyfriend or my friends and I hate being that annoying person who always asks “you don’t regret our relationship”. I’m tired and I have no idea what to do. I’ve been feeling so sad lately and very stressed and I can’t sleep and I have headaches all the time. I just want to cry and to get a hug maybe.

May take college medical withdrawal but I'll be broke? Long read,"I'm at a cross roads. Yesterday, I had a mid term and showed up 50 minutes late. I had actually gotten up that morning to go and take it (my mom took the car extra early and came back late even though I told her that I needed to be at school). Unfortunately this didnt help the fact that I havent been attending school or doing the hwks and labs. My programming professor understood and gave me the slip to go back to do the labs and hwks that I missed. Though again, yesterday I was told that I'm approaching the deadline for this consideration very close and was suggested to take a medical withdrawal by my professor. This year just isnt my year. I feel withdrawn from everything and just cant bring myself to hold onto the shread of stability. Me missing my classes is also something I told my therapist and psychiatrist about. 

My professor wants to hold a meeting with me and my academic advisor to see if there is a way to avoid medical withdrawal and catch up on assignments. I appreciated the consideration until early today, when I realized that I most likely wont be attending lab today either. I cant keep doing this. This is the second time I've taken this class and its gotten admittedly worse. The first time was alright but this time...is terrible. I dont have a support group like last time and I dont have a team. My first time, I was turning in assignments but the lack on my part was not studying for the midterm but I still had a long stride of actually passing then. I feel so uncomfortable in class, I feel like a foreigner.  I get sad because it's  as if I have no idea what's going on around me and it makes me so sad. 

I have a sibling who faced this problem when she tried attending college. She got depressed, started sleeping in and never leaving for school. I dont know why we cant stay in college and actually graduate but it seems like a curse. 


If I leave school, I'm faced with having to leave my school job. If I lose my school job, I wont have any funds. My mother will be leaving me in our hometown and I wont be able to get help from her like I need . I know that if i withdraw, i wont be able to withdraw from one class, I'd have to leave all of them. I didnt have the best if luck from finding work without school ties. So, I'm scared to leave school. I'm diagnosed with depression and GAD. I'd be anxiety ridden and depressed knowing that I'll be holding my grad year back and I wont be able to conjure up funds. 

I wanted to love school. I know I can love learning but I cant seem to love that or anything else right now. I was supposed to be graduating this year but I souldnt be anyway due to needing more classes to complete. I had planned on passing this semester and taking up extra summer classes go shorten time but ...that's all gone. 

I dont know what to do. Should I schedule this meeting in hope of finding options where I dont withdraw and end up pissing away at the possible opportunities? Or just withdrawal, be possibly homeless and come back to school when I'm better? Its hard making a living without a college degree and im worried. I want to stop the self sabotage of depression  but it's as if I can't.


I don't want to leave my home. I want to stay home all the time . I told my counselor this and it's as if she doesnt really get it. She makes it seem as if it's an easy fix and then I wont do it again. I hate the therapists I've had because they are very ineffective.

Was I emotionally triggered because of it resonates deep within my subconscious? Or is it just because I long such relationship potrayed in it as a pedophile? Or both?

It's so strange because health professionals are always asking if I'm having 'dark thoughts' and it's like,  well,  what really *is* a dark thought? When it comes down to it,  it's the behaviour, the intention, not the thoughts,  that are the true issue.  

Death is always on my mind.  Not just my own,  but anyone and everyone.  I think constantly about different situations where people in my life die tragically,  and how I would grieve.  Would I crumple into a depressed mess or rise to the occasion and be strong for the rest of my family?  Who would care if I died?  So many questions all the time.

Five years later and I still miss her.,"She told me she would have married me. I thought I needed to gender transition. It all fell to pieces.

"I'm a deadbeat, a total deadbeat, and I can only blame myself for it.","Trans girl, 17 years old. I've sat on my ass and done practically nothing for the past 2 years, got withdrawn at 15 from school due to mom worried that I'd get bullied for being trans, tried homeschooling but fell out of it. I always said that I'm not a true drop-out because I plan on getting into college at some point, but right now I don't even know if that's possible. 

My body is worthless, 6 feet tall and 130 lbs, nobody wants to date a skeleton, and if they do, maybe there is something wrong with them... I can get skinny people, but ones who are bony to the point of concern... I can't get why anyone would be attracted to me. Yet I somehow have a boyfriend. 

My jawline and brow ridge make me look like a fucking Neanderthal, and yet I've been told that I'd pass fine with estrogen, they're all just being nice. They know the crushing, suicidal feeling it is if you're ever told that you can't pass, and they simply don't want me to get pushed over the edge and end it, they're only being nice. 

Haven't gotten a job, haven't even gotten a license, and haven't done anything school related much either. I just sit on my ass and play video games, watch youtube, anime, listen to music, I just do my hobbies, I think about getting off my ass and getting my life back on track but the lack of motivation I have is weighing me down like an anvil tied to my ankles. I just feel no need to...

I'm a joke, and one with a mediocre punchline too. Somebody respectable would have done SOMETHING by now, I've been emotionally abused by my stepfather for a few years but I got over it, so I really can't use that reason or excuse. I could have had a job, had a license and be in college right now, but I can't. Because I lack any motivation, because I don't want my license to say ""male"" or my dead name, because I don't want to be discriminated or humiliated at any public workplaces for being trans, maybe if I wasn't such a lazy pussy, I could have gotten somewhere. 

But nah, I haven't, and it's all because of laziness, lack of motivation, and fear. 6 months to recover? Fair enough, a year? Maybe if it's that serious, but 2 years? Sigh... If there is one word anyone can describe me as, it would be; a failure.

Nearly a year into my gender transition: What I've learned. MtF,"I thought I escaped the depression. From the first dose of my Spiro and Estrogen I felt a huge weight off of my shoulders. It was time to be myself and thrive. I enjoyed it. I no longer needed to hide. After a couple of months I thought I'd try dating. Of course, I expected the hate messages. I expected the slurs. What I never expected was the amount of men that maintained interest after I disclosed that I'm transgender. What I soon found was a pattern. A pattern I could not escape. It was in this moment I realized what being a living fetish is like. 

For the past nine months I've been nothing more to men than a source for pictures and a discreet fun time. I still fall for the player saying he wants something more than hooking up just to be used, ghosted, and hit up when he is drunk and horny. The first few times hurt my ego but I recovered. Having the same story for nine months straight makes me question if this is all that life has for me. 

I want nothing more than to just connect with someone. Talk with a guy about life and get to know each other. But. The only attention I ever get are if I post naughty pics or nudes. Once I show and indication that I'm human they ghost. I've made a few trans friends and the story is the same. Doesn't matter how pretty. How much they pass. We're just a fetish and nothing more. It makes sense why they're all either depressed or escorts. 

I've fought the desire to end it completely so I no longer have to deal with the loneliness. It's a crippling loneliness.

my mom just gave up on me,"Since I was young, my mom was the only person who took care of me because my dad left when I was a baby. However, during the summer before freshman year, my parents agreed to move in together and share an apartment so that I could have both of my parents. My dad made a clear that he changed for the better and he wasn't gonna be a deadbeat anymore. This arrangement only lasted for about a year and a half, however, because my dad recently moved out two weeks ago.

My dad leaving again hurt a lot because I felt like I didn't build enough of a relationship with him. I never really got to the point where I could tell him personal stuff, especially how I feel about him and his decision to leave again. It's just been adding on stress and anxiety.

Yesterday, the straw that broke the camels back erupted at school, and I ended up in a violent altercation with another student. I pushed him into the wall, and his head started to bleed. A lot. I immediately went to apologize, and he said there was no hard feelings.

I was suspended for five days, and my mom was furious after she found out. Over the last two days, she's been repeatedly telling me that she's given up on me and my dreams. She says the only place I'll ever end up is prison, and I'll never be shit. So now she's giving me to my dad because she just can't handle me anymore and all I do is make her suffer.",NinjaSnadger360,0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/fef07m/my_mom_just_gave_up_on_me/,since wa young mom wa person took care dad left wa baby however summer freshman year parent agreed move together share apartment could parent dad made clear changed better gonna deadbeat anymore arrangement lasted year half however dad recently moved two week ago dad leaving hurt lot felt like build enough relationship never really got point could tell personal stuff especially feel decision leave adding stress anxiety yesterday straw broke camel back erupted school ended violent altercation another student pushed wall head started bleed lot immediately went apologize said wa hard feeling wa suspended five day mom wa furious found last two day repeatedly telling given dream say place ever end prison never shit giving dad handle anymore make suffer,mom gave,ninja nad ger 360

goodnight,"I want to live. I'm a little, cheerful girl. I love music. Whenever I'm about to go to sleep, I take my pink mp3 player to my bed and listen to my favorite songs for hours while imagining myself as a skydiver, princess or a superhero! As I dive into the blue sky I scream so loud that my throat hurts. Maybe if I'm loud enough I won't be able to hear my mother's epileptic seizure as the nice paramedic asks me what I've been reading and if school is going good. I try to ignore my grandma crying while my grandfather just looks away from what is happening. School is going good, I'm really enjoying my art classes. The teacher says that I have some potential and that I'm a pleasure to have in class. Maybe because I rarely talk. I like when my teacher praises me, it makes me feel like I'm special - I think as I sit on my bed, with one of my CDs playing in the background.

I'm in middle school. I live in the city now. My school is bigger, more modern and it even has a cafeteria. It's always crowded yet somehow empty at the same time. I no longer have art classes. My teachers say that I'm smart but kind of lazy. All of the girls are so pretty. My cheeks are chubbier than theirs, my legs are thicker and my belly is sticking out. I skip my lunch. Looking at pictures of gorgeous and thin girls on the internet makes me feel full. I hate PE classes. I'm the only girl that can't play volleyball. I hit the ball really hard and now my hoodie is stained red. It hurts but I pretend nothing has happened. Nobody notices. 

High school is scary. Boys don't really like me. Maybe because of the way I dress or because I cut my hair very short. Starving becomes binging. I really hate my thighs. I'm the class clown. I skip school every day for a week. I overdose on medication several times. One time I almost fall down the stairs and pass out in my bathtub after overdosing on some pills. I try to kill myself. When in the ER one of my teachers is there. She looks at me. I can barely stay awake. One of the nurses tells me that I'm selfish. After coming back from hospital my teachers say that I'm the laziest student they've ever had. My mother forces me to lie so they won't put me in a psychiatric facility. I go to the psychiatrist once and never go back. Now my grandma sleeps in my room and they look through my stuff every day. I have to ask to go to the bathroom. My mom makes me stay in the guest room with only a bed, a desk and my textbooks. Dinner tastes awful. I want to die. 

College starts. My major is not that great. I have literature classes. I'm a very average student. Sometimes I remember my elementary school art teacher. I feel like I failed her. Boys still don't like me. My cheeks are still way too chubby. My body is covered in white thick lines. People stare a lot. Some ask questions some just avoid me. I still imagine and fantasize before going to sleep a lot. Skydiving turned into jumping off a bridge into a river, grand parties and colorful dresses turned into lonely college dorms, oversized t-shirts, and old sweaters, I no longer am a superhero, now I'm the one waiting for someone or something to save me. I no longer scream, I no longer put up a fight. I remember loving music but now it just gives me a headache. I'm an almost 21-year-old, tired woman. I no longer want to live.

She has talked to me frequently but it just seems that she doesn't care. One of my friends who I thought was my friend leaked out that I'm autistic and have ADHD as well as I take medications for that every day. Now, whenever I walk around school people look at me and laugh while talking shit about me. Some have called me a freak and leave the school and go to a mental asylum. I've been called a mistake so many times. All this has been affecting me emotionally and physically. This has been making my depression worse and has increased my levels of anxiety. I've been having more anxiety attacks since this all started. Everything around me is starting to become meaningless to me. Nothing other than my mom, my dog, and my little brother give me a genuine source of happiness. The people at my school have made me feel even more worthless than I was before this. I want to feel accepted by someone other than my family. (I consider my friends family as well) People who don't talk shit about me or don't look at me strangely just disregard I'm there.

It hurts..but I remembered the feelings I had last time I went and saw you. It hurt..I cried myself to sleep. I went to bed hurting and I woke up hurting. Once again I’m left looking dumb to go out of my way to see you. I crossed many busy roads and climbed many tall mountains to just try and please you and I still believe you truly don’t care. It’s hard letting go of the one person that once made you the happiest you had ever been in life. Looking back at when I had you I looked so different. I literally had a glow within me. You gave me that glow that made me shine so bright..you also took it away without any hesitation. I’ve never been the same since then. I’m not sure why I’ve kept you around for 2 more years after we broke up. I know deep down you will never be able to make me shine like you used to..I will never have that glow again. I will never be able to feel that love again..and it simple as to why not..because you don’t love me..you don’t care about me..It’s funny how life works. How the people you would do anything for in this world will do nothing for you. How the ones that once made you so happy now bring darkness into your life. When will one day someone fight for me..fight to keep me seeing me glow...fight to keep me happy..Hopefully soon..but for now as I wait I’ve decided to not cross any busy roads for you or climb any mountains..for now I will stay here even though it hurts I’m safer here by myself than with you.",princessmaeha199920,0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/fegd3g/choosing_not_to_see_you_this_time/,hurt remembered feeling last time went saw hurt cried sleep went bed hurting woke hurting left looking dumb go way see crossed many busy road climbed many tall mountain try please still believe truly care hard letting go one person made happiest ever life looking back looked different literally glow within gave glow made shine bright also took away without hesitation never since sure kept around 2 year broke know deep never able make shine like used never glow never able feel love simple love care funny life work people would anything world nothing one made happy bring darkness life one day someone fight fight keep seeing glow fight keep happy hopefully soon wait decided cross busy road climb mountain stay even though hurt safer,choosing see time,princess mae ha 199920

These are probably the last 14 days in my life.,"I’m 27 years old and I have been struggling with depression for years. Couple days ago, I have finally decided that I’m going to end this miserable life for good. I have already planned my way out properly - on 17th March, using 20 grams of Potassium Cyanide mixed with water, I need of course to find a place as far away from the crowd (i.e forest or something) then I’m just going to lay down there and finally be at peace. I’m hoping it wouldn’t be so painful. I have done research that correct dose of this poison will give you a clean death in a matter of seconds. 

Funny thing is, I don’t actually want to die. I love life. The smell of rain, the beauty of music, the taste of sugar, life is such a wonderful thing. But I just can’t take it anymore. My life is extremely difficult. I am just totally giving up. It’s just too much for me to stay alive. Thought I share my story here for those of you who are still fighting.

"Trapped with my own monsters, until it's over","I feel so worthless for so many years now.

but the past week I feel nothing else than  desperate, pain, sadness and emptiness. 

I've realized there is no one that would be there for me, never. 

I have vacations now for a month. After the first day I felt like nothing. I'm just something. Maybe a part of the nature. I mean I do nothing the entire day nothing at all because nothing helps. Everything is just boring and I don't feel anything. I have no one to rely on, every time when I start to make a friendship the people just leave me after spending too much time with me, I mean when they start to know me a little bit everyone left me. Or they use me. I'm getting sick of everything. 

People say things will get better, I'm happy that this is true for some people but it's not for everyone. I just feel like a shadow that no one ever notices. 

I changing my current state or emotions rapidly. Like the last time I played VRChat (a pc game for the VR, where you can wander around worlds meet other people and so on) I had fun but after one second it despaired and I was mad like hell for no reason. 

I feel like their are more minds inside my own mind. other kind of personalitys. 

I just want to end it all but I'm too weak to do it by myself, I see no exit out of this emptiness it got closed. I just hope everyday to die and to forget everything. Or to stop everything for a few years to take a break and get my shit together, but it's just too late. 

I don't even have a family that I could spend my time with, Not even a friend anymore, Not even anyone. Everything is just overwhelming and too much even there is nothing. I can't even cry.

"I tried to kill myself yesterday and wanna quit the meds, long post","So i was at a party and got drunk, not i cant walk drunk, but drunk enough to make my metabolism fast enough to get rid of all the meds in my blood i guess. I just finished high school and at this party were all my classmates and the people i once called friends. 
I thought i could go there and talk to them and try to befriend them again. I miss them so much. Ive always been very shy and i thought i would drink because that makes me all bubbly and stuff, but this time it just did not work, i went right past the bubbly and the very drunk and a mess straight to i feel like i wanna die. This had never happened to me before.
So there i was, kinda off my meds and feeling depressed and there was a pool so in a place no one would notice too fast i started getting in slowly. Then i just jumped. I tried to do it but my body wouldnt all i wanted to do was sink to the bottom and numb everything out and then justgo i guess? But my body wouldnt, i couldnt physically do it.
My parents came and 4 people tried to help. Only one of which i would have expected and its not like i didnt like them i just didnt think they liked me, definatly not enough to help and im sure they will dissapear now, except for the one, but he cant take care of me like i need it. I need someone to be there all the time and i guess thats not fair.
I guess thats not fair, because thats how i lost my friends. They didnt understand i needed someone to be there and i tried to open up but i also need checkups, because i will convince myself im just bothering. 
I wanted one of my friends to help me the most, the one id known the longest, the one i had always been able to come back to, but i didnt get that she just didnt have the time or the will to help me like i needed anymore.
Now i dont wanna take the meds because i truly thought i was better. Turns out i was just drugged all the time and it feels so fake now. I thought i was happy and out of it and that soon enough my doctor would take me off them slowly. That i was starting to understand how not to be depressed, but now i think the only way to do that is to feel it and fight it, not take drugs and make it ""disappear"".

forcing myself to appreciate my progress,"Hi! I've been battling depression for the past two years, officially diagnosed in summer 2019, currently on medication &amp; therapy. Beating myself up every. single. day. for just being ""lazy"", and ""not being able to get it together"", as well as struggling with the thought that i somehow just tricked everybody (including the doctors) into thinking that i have depression when really i dont. 🥴  
Anyways, after another horrifying therapy session of me complaining that i am really just a piece of shit that only wants to sleep 24/7, wasting her life away not accomplishing anything, my therapist urged me to list all the things which i do DO and sort of look at them from afar and try to practice gratitude and appreciation. Here it is:

1) most days, I am able to make myself brush my teeth and on the good days even take a shower  
2) i could have given up on all work  to kind of ""sleep through"" my depression (my partner can support me financially with no trouble) however as tempting as it is I still do the work (working remotely from home) and recently took on a big project, which I was debating declining but still didn't (no idea how and if  im going to handle it but ill update you on here)  
3) roughly once a week I may feel like putting on makeup and doing my nails  
4) i am able to socialize with my best friend and truly enjoy our evenings together, which is a huge one  
5) i am now able to recognise that the meds do really help and I stopped having hysterical breakdowns and intrusive, disturbing thoughts  
6) i have never missed a day of therapy  
7) even though my sleep schedule is non-existence (sleeping every 4 hours during the course of a day) I still pull myself out of bed, have breakfast, maybe out on some clothes and go out to work in a cafe, even if for just an hour

My parents always thought I was lazy,"as the title states my parents always thought I was lazy in my highschool days, but I was just unbelievably depressed. Can anyone else relate? 

was I lazy at times? Hell yea brother but isn’t everyone at some point? They’d call me lazy if I hung out in my bedroom, didn’t shower, ect went on for all my highschool days even when I was on a football team my whole highschool life never came home till 6 and was gone Friday/Saturday nights out with friends, cleaned up as much as a teenager does. 

My point being why didn’t my parents ever sit me down and talk to me and explain it? I remember having tears coming down my face as 14 year old me held a knife in the kitchen as my step dad walked towards the laundry room I had a sigh of relief that someone would help but he didn’t mention it or see me or talk to me. I feel like if they would’ve just sat me down after seeing these signs they’d know and I’d be way better developed then I am now cause I’m just learning these things now. I had no idea it was even depression I thought something was wrong with me, still do till this day. They determined I was the quiet one and didn’t like to talk much but up until highschool I never had that problem, I felt like I got sunk into a depression and never really came out of it and now I’m stuck being profiled as this guy I’m not, even when I speak I get spoken over like it’s a primal thing or them trying to shun my words? 

I don’t want people to think my parents where bad they were great but I just don’t understand it at all. For me when I have kids I’d make sure to see the quiet signs

I'm a mess right now,"I have no one to listen to my problems so I thought I would write them down. Then I decided to post it on here. 

Just moved to a new city and started at a new school. I don't miss anything from my old hometown, I'm actually quite happy to be somewhere else. Moving has been tough though. I had to give up my cat and say goodbye to my friends.

I have kind of 'joined' a group of friends at school. They're all pretty nice. The dynamic of the group is a little weird though. Its like 50% introverts who don't talk much, myself included, and 50% strongly opinionated extroverts. They mostly seem like a nice group of people though. In regard to making friends, things have gone pretty well. Trying to form deep relationships with people is a hard and long process though. It's hard not to get impatient and blame myself though. I feel like I'm being ungrateful because even though I think I've been lucky in finding a group of friends, which is exactly what I want, I still feel so shit.

I've never been diagnosed but I think I could have depression and/or anxiety. I would love to get some medication if it would ease the pain, but I don't want to tell my parents how I feel.

Over the past few years I've thought of suicide probably at least once a month, usually weekly or daily though, and planned it two or three times in my life. I've been thinking about it a lot recently. I've been researching pills I can get at a chemist that I could overdose on and I've found a suicide bridge that's very close to my house. I've been told that I should live for all the good moments in life, but the effort it takes to reach those moments doesn't seem worth it sometimes.

I'm starting to find it hard to trust myself. I'm like a different person from day to day, or even hour to hour. During the brief moments when I feel happy about something I worry about my emotions causing me to do something I regret. When I'm sad or empty it's all I can think about.

There's this girl who's not in my new social circle but who has been really nice to me. She seems like a really nice person. We don't see each other much but she always makes an effort to greet me. I'm unsure whether her intentions are romantic or platonic and it's making me dizzy. I really want us to become better friends or maybe more, but I am not great at social interaction and always make myself feel shit about every little mistake I make. I feel kind of like It'll never happen, yet I spent the whole afternoon texting her. I feel like I'm going insane.

The people I admire most are the ones that seem like the nicest people you could ever know and make you feel happy just being present or after a short conversation and you're always left wanting more from them. I aspire to be like this and make other people happy. I need to remember to smile more though.

Usually I have a high libido but the past two weeks my drive has literally been non-existent. A month ago my shit suddenly became sloppy even though my diet is quite healthy and hasn't changed much, I think it is anxiety causing me to be extremely tense all the time. I just started waking up at 4am every morning out of nowhere and I can't stop. I don't know what the fuck is happening to me.

I feel so lonely. I just want someone to talk to and listen to. Getting to that point with someone new takes time and I'm getting kind of impatient.

I don't know what to do to make myself happy. If things worked out with this girl I think I would be happier, yet the thought of her losing interest in me makes me feel awful.

Missing the sadness,"I suffered with depression for many years, and haven recently reached a turning point in my life where I finally feel good again, but somethings a little off, all my emotions are less extreme, sadness passes in minutes now and is nowhere near the intensity is was before, but I feel this weird longing to feel an emotion to that same depth and extreme again, has anyone else experienced this? Or am I going mad?
It’s like I was so used to the emotion everything else feels uncomfortable now.

I feel so stupid for feeling like this, I’m lucky enough to (it appears so far) gotten past the darkness that defined my teens and early adulthood, and I have this sick lust to feel it again?

It also come with this constant creeping fear that this ‘ok’ness I’m feeling now is a facade, that soon something will happen and I will fall back into my old state instantly.

The conflict of this fear and the longing is driving me a little mad.
I can’t talk to anyone I know about it because I’m pretty sure I’m gonna sound insane, so I guess I’m asking you guys.

Complete dissatisfied human being.,"So I‘m a bit excited about writing a post about it. I‘m struggling from severe depression since I‘m 11. I‘m also not the one who‘s crying over things happened in the past. It’s about my condition I‘ve been living with the last years and want some advices about how to finally be able to handle it.

Everyday I wake up with great dissatisfaction. Always in a bad mood. No motivation at all. Always tired and sleepy and feeling totally lost. I‘ve lost interest in nearly everything - drawing, music, singing... Not knowing what to do, I fear the future ahead of me. I was once totally into Design... thought this is what I‘m going to do. However, I‘ve also lost the interest in it. It was a gradual change and I can’t even explain why it happened since I was always passionate about it. 

Now I‘m sitting there - day by day - everything is annoying, not interesting anymore, not worth it and stressful to me. I feel like I fell into an Abyss with my head full of negative thoughts. I don’t know who I am neither am I satisfied with how the situation isn’t changing. I tried meditation once. It was a good experience. But I‘m not even in the mood to continue what might help me out of this situation. The only thing I’m currently doing is just playing games the whole day so I won’t be confronted with all those bad thoughts flooding my mind.

Don’t get me wrong. I’m really grateful for what I have. Being able to sleep on a bed, having enough food and embracing the small things in live. I don’t like it fancy. I just want to find happiness and being able to laugh again.

Hi,"Ive been really depressed lately... My math subject at school failed, i keep thinking i wont graduate, i have no energy to go to school anymore so i fake everything and go to a nearby computer cafe even though i only have enough money to commute to my school. I know lifes hard but theres something in my brain that broke... Im not crazy though just uncaring. But i noticed i suddenly grew an interest on one of our kitchen knives, not like to hurt people, its just an odd interest where you imagine the knife killing you painlessly.
But the thing is, i have a phobia of sharp things so i grew up cautious with sharp objects including knives... Its not really bad, i just do stabbing motions on myself, but the point is i consider doing that normal.
I also keep daydreaming while walking and oddly enough i daydream about me getting in a car crash or something similar, which i has a  high chance of happening considering im daydreaming. Another point is my fake laughter, i dont know why i keep doing it. I know im probably mentally ill but i have no why of knowing since psychiatrists and therapists costs very much in my country.

Miserable College Student,"I hate college. I hate myself. I hate everyone else who attends my college.

I wish I could just lay in my bed in my dorm room all day, so I would not have to see anybody or do anything. I have no passions or interests, only tasks that I must complete so that I can return to laying in my bed. 

I used to be a high achieving student in high school in academics and athletics. Now I am a washed up bum who can not perform the simplest of tasks correctly; I am so pathetic. I had such high hopes of using the ivy-league college I worked hard to get into as a spring board for a successful career, but I have already failed miserably. I do not have the skills one needs to make it in the real world.

Medication works!!!,"I have been diagnosed with anxiety and depression right now and I have been taking prescription meds for the last couple weeks. It really helps! 

A little background- I got out of a 6 year relationship due to not seeing a future with my ex in December 2019. And then one person who I thought was really close friend of mine, decided he did not want to be friends with me anymore and cut all contacts with me. I get emotionally attached wayyy too easily and this led to me having anxiety, panic attacks and depression - which eventually led to insomnia, IBS, migraines and constant body aches. 

I started therapy in feb 2020 and have been since going to my therapist every week. And my therapist suggested I look at options for medication and try it. So since the last 2 weeks, I’m on Lexapro (SSRI) and my psychiatrist did tell me that it is going to take a few weeks to see changes. But for the last 3/4 days I have been observing that my energy levels have increased because I have been able to sleep well and it is so much better. My IBS has decreased and I haven’t got any migraines. I’m really really glad the medication is helping. If anyone is out there looking of options, and one the fence of trying medication, go for it.

Just need to vent.,"My depression has been at its worst recently and I’ve been trying desperately to find a therapist. The people I usually go through have told me it’s a 9 month waiting list and I honestly don’t think I’ll be able to wait that long so they suggested someone else. I checked their website and applied for therapy and managed to book an assessment appointment for next month. I slept easier last night at the thought that I’d be getting help soon only to wake up this morning to a notification on my phone saying they had cancelled my appointment as they no longer help people in my area. 

I’m just so sick of trying to help myself. I know it’s not their fault for not being able to help me, but just that brief feeling of hope meant so much to me. They shouldn’t allow people to apply if they aren’t going to be able to help or at least have a warning up. Everywhere I’ve looked so far has said to either wait, go to A&amp;E or call 111 IF it’s an emergency. What classifies as an emergency? Because I’m almost certain I wouldn’t be considered one and I don’t want to waste their time considering the NHS is already stretched thin. I’d pay for a therapist if I had the means but I can barely afford to feed myself right now.

"My life story, I am sorry it's so long","Hi there to all witches who take their craft seriously and really work, I am very deperate and on the brink of killing myself, there is so much to life; this I know. Unfortunately for me every door, every option, every opertunity has been closed off for me since I was born. 
Before I say what I came here to ask here's alittle backstory...

Backstory - throughout my mom's pregnancy the doctors were absolutely sure I was to be born a healthy baby girl, but somewhere along the line something unexpected happened and I came out not only a boy (according to what I've been told and what's written on my birth certificate) I was also unfortunate enough to be born with cleft lip, cleft palette, asthma, droopy eyes(don't know if that's the clinical term, but basically up until I was 8 or 10 [can't remember] I was unable to open my eyes all the way), and various other problems. I have always felt like I should not have been born a boy let alone live past 3 weeks (another failed diagnosis, lucky me right?). 

My childhood consisted of doing stuff to get attention but really all I wanted was to be liked a very hard thing to do when you are basically physically retarded and cannot talk like everyone else and constantly being reminded how you are such a failer that you couldn't even be born right. Since my conciousness first made its way into this world I have found myself thinking as a girl, along with thinking how much better litterally my life would have been if I managed to get it right. My dad was never in the picture so growing up without a father has been difficult on its own, but of course I was informed my dad had the chance to come to America when I was born because of my condition, but he declined to start a new family and I'm sure he had other reasons. My mom always worked all the time so it was pretty much me and my older brother for some time. An older brother that constantly made fun of me along with my mom for how I talked and how I acted. My brother constantly calling me gay, faggot, bitch, you name it he's done it. I'm sure he was unaware of how I felt inside but it traumatized me so much I am afraid of being myself. My body is not shaped how normal guy's are either so I have no idea how to take that problem. At school o was labeled the retarded kid no one liked.

Once I turned 11 my mom met a man, let's call him D. D was/is military and I later found out they got married quick (span of a few months) to finance my surgeries because I came from a background of poverty being single parent with 2 kids (later 3). I was always treated like a pet and always had the harshest and most frequent punishments. I was always forced to do everything for everybody else. My brother had to go do something like talk to a neighbor to get the bike fixed, I had to do it, stuff like that. To this day I get asked by family to buy their plane tickets or order them stuff cause they ""don't know how"". I have always been used all my life. I am nothing but a tool. As I patiently waited for the surgeries that I was supposed to get (atleast just the one to fix my nose and make me look somewhat normal) when I was 12, then delayed to 16, then 18, and finally at 19. I received the first surgery and all they did was make my life a living hell. 

Medical history - The doctor messed up my nose and now theres a glasses size gap on the bridge of my nose, for the tip of it they put cartalage from my side [which they lied to me and took it out of under my right chest] is fat which I didn't even care about having in the first place I just wanted my nose to be straight and deal with the rest later. I was put in a maxillary distractor (fancy name for cage on my head). To move my upper jaw forward so that they can reconstruct the palate (roof of my mouth) and straighten jaw or whatever they were doing I have no clue and it seemed unnessesary to me. It did however improve my speech just a tiny bit. I had to wear this crap o. My head for 4 months. Later I then made my own appointments 2 years later (22) and got a surgery for bonegraft. I am still missing the tooth implant which I cannot afford nor will I ever be able to, and I have to have another surgery on my nose again. I have always suffered from depression because of this but not only because of my unfortunate medical circumstances. (Also I have been getting pains around my abdominal area so either I've got something going on down there that shouldn't be or when I was born the doctors decided it be best to stick a penis on me and call me a boy).

As for the other reasons why I'm highly depressed and on the verge of collapsing. I was forced by my stepdad to go into debt. I wanted to go to college but I wanted to do it like everyone else, a real place surrounded by real people so I can maybe make atleast one friend and not be a total failer. Of course my luck hits home again and he forced me to go to an online college with the promiss of letting me use the money the army provides to him for school use. I agree and then he turns and days ""yea no... Do it yourself"". Landing me 16k debt that I can't pay, 3k I was forced to pay (just to get my diploma) and 3k my mom was forced to pay for me to be able to enroll in classes. Before this though I was planning to join the military to get a one up on life, but apparently not God's plan. Since when I brought up the idea he straight refused. I was not allowed to work or go out, I did not have an allowance or any type of money except money I got for my birthday ($20 every year, ages 18-19-20) and it didn't help that I had no friends up until senior year in highschool (that summer is the only happy memories I have after leaving my home town. He was very controlling that's why I feel I can't do anything without the constant reminder of all the trauma I've faced.

I did however keep the promis I made to myself about joining the military. Unfortunately though I was not let in. After two years of waiting and providing all of the medical paperwork I was finally sent to MEPS for the Marines, finally a chance for me to straighten out my life and man up and get all these rediculous thoughts and feelings out my head. NOPE! Once I get there I take the ASVAP and score on the higher side (I know right smarts actually came in handy I might look like a retard but my mental capacity is on the higher side) scored 80. Go through medical everything good up until the physical, the doctor asks me if I always been tall and skinny (I have a very feminine body besides the lack of breasts and having a penis) I say yes, normal ok cool then I go to the eye exam and they tell me I have astigmatism in my left eye (this I knew it happened when I was about 5 or so, started hallucinating and seeing giant spiders with extream detail) I went to see if I can get this fixed they said and I quote ""the damage to your eye is so savire that we do not have the equipment required to even make a dent of progress, the best solution I can offer is to use the effected eye and hope it gets better over time, sorry but there is nothing we can do for you at this time."" - Lasik doctor. So dream job at Marines = no go. The MEPS people tell me to try the army cause they accept pretty much anyone. I do and same thing they say I can't join because of my stupid eye, gee thanks God. 

At this point I start thinking maybe it's not meant to be and give up. 

My job history is halarious, atleast to me. Almost even didn't get hired. First job at age 20, McDonald's. Mom gets a house with my brother who got to live my fantasy of being in the military and travel the world, who then decides to mock me and make my life even worse by deciding he needs a surgery on his penis (he thought it was so curved he can't have sex yet he never tried, now he's depressed and thinks he can never have it and the doctor messed up, doctor also gave him circomsition) this happened during my attempt at joining the Marines. Throughout the course of 6 months he would constantly scream at the top of his lungs and say how God hates him, this is punishment, lash out at me for no reason, and make me feel not only unsafe but want to take my own life even more just to get out of that situation. Once we move into the new house this continues along with me every day for months on end calming him down explaining and telling him to be patient cause it's not gunna heal right away and healing of the body depends on the mind state anyways. Because of the move I am forced to quit my job that I actually enjoyed, to transfer to another McDonald's on the side of town we moved to (two towns down) I work there for 6 months before quitting because of how unfairly I was being treated, everything was my fault, I never did anything right, I was lazy, the works (even though I did mainly everybody's job in the kitchen, everyday I washed the grill swept mopped multiple times a day, I would be on grill then on the table making the burgers, I'd go and get the 50 pound boxes from the freezer. You name it I did it.) I eventually quit after 6 months bought a one way ticket to California and said my goodbyes to my brother who called my mom crying saying I left and he tried to stop me... I was sick of his shit. I had shit I was dealing with all my life and now I have to deal with you and your problem too, (excuse the langauge but) fuck outta here with that shit. 
I have so little control over my own life that I only spent 2 days in California before my mom told the entire family where I was and got my aunt (grandma's sister so technically grandma, who's also a nun) to somehow convince me to go to New York and stay with my uncle. I can't believe I actually fell for their stupid guilt trip but somehow after only 5 days I was off to NYC. I told myself it's probably best since there are lots of opportunities for me to be a musican. Wrong. I was basically plummited into the same exact situation with different people. Greedy money hungry aunt, no jobs, no money, an uncle who works at night sleeps durring the day, wierd daughter that turned into her mother. I had to get outta there it got to the point where she was looking through my stuff while I wasn't there to find proof I could pay her $700 to stay in the shitty, stinky room they kept rabbits in. With a door that locks from the outside and a broken window, very small room at that. After two months of looking for jobs while making music simaltaniously I am being called a liar I good for nothing a lazy bum you name it that's what she labeled me. I manage to get a job at McDonald's again but in NY. I manage to set up the bonegraft appointment and lay on an air mattress for two weeks feeling useless and being called useless. I go back to work and then move into my grandpa's room he was renting. Lucky for me he was on vacation for the next two months. Durring this time when my granpa came back j felt obligated and wanted to help with his bills ultimately giving him what little I had. 4 months pass and after much consideration and mom/brother begging for me to come back I oblige. 
I then get a job at another McDonald's in the next town over oppisate direction with the help of my old boss. I work there for 6 months before quitting because of the same drama the first time and hearing people continuously talking shit about me making me feel terrible about myself even more and with the emense parinoia I was experiencing due to smoking too much (the parinoia was about how I hid the fact I'm not normal and that I wish to be a girl and intricate details of my life).

If you think that's it well your wrong... My aunt comes to the USA on a visa and is put in a shit situation feeling unsafe, according to her. My mom is the only one in the USA she knows, mom folds and buys her a plane ticket to stay here for the time being, money my mom didn't have, which is fine desperate times desperate measures and such. She stays here for an entire month and quickly realises there is nothing here, everything is far and you have to drive everywhere. The time that she was here I could have used to work on my music the 3 hours I was left alone in the house, but no. 
Everything that she bought or well made me buy she complains and says it's for someone else, complains she didn't buy anything for herself and how she had to use my mom's clothes cause instead of buy things for herself she bought for everyone else supposedly. She then says how she needs a phone and makes me go find one for her. After I go through the trouble of finding and iPhone 7 plus for a crazy deal ($150) which they usually go for 300-350 I go and I borrow money to go get her the phone. She then says oh... I wanted a more modern one....like yours.... I'm like ugh ok I reset mine give her it and she then says she will give me the 150 (my phone was iPhone X pristine condition). Months pass I still don't have a job (stopped looking to focus on getting my licence), everybody keeps making excuses not to teach me, and the piece of crap car that my brother was going to pass down to me needs a new battery so I can't use it, and he also decided to retract the offer before I got the chance to use it and is selling it because he doesn't want to pay for it. He is not rich but wealthy $40k in the bank meanwhile I'm 30k in debt 12 of which collectors are being sent now. 

Debt - borrowed money I didn't have to help pay bills to not be called worthless and useless. Borrowed too much then took 5k out and ran away to California

That brings me to the present day, some details have been left out as to not make this extreamly long.
(Side note: I have always liked girls but it's more like an admiration/envy type of thing, always wishing I was one cause I always felt just wrong in my own body)

I hate my life,"I hate my life so much I would be better off dead I feel, everyday is the same and nothing in life gets better, and the few friends I have seen to not like me anymore, a lot of them don’t talk to me at all and my school friends seem like they don’t like me anymore and I found out a lot of them talking shit about me that I thought were my friends, and I already got bullied for half the year. 

I don’t wanna live anymore, and I can’t even see a doctor even though I have the legal right to one there is none available and walk in clinics are useless. Canada has shit healthcare 

My grades are so bad and I’m disappointment to my parents. At this point I wanna just drown my problems with drugs. 

Me and my gf keep fighting and having problems and she just moved to a new school and told me how “everyone’s been so nice especially the boys” and like that’s troubled me because I’m ugly and I have nothing to offer with my personality so I feel like any guy is better for her than I am but I need her.

I just want to go home,"28F. My husband wanted to move from West coast to the East coast. Here we are 5 months later. I hate my job and most coworkers. I met a coworker I loved but she ended up leaving and now I have nothing to look forward to at work. I eat in my car I'd rather eat by myself than with gossiping, whining women.

My husband has always been a people person so hes made friends pretty quick. There's days were hes out and I'm sitting home alone.   

So alone. I cry in secret. I keep things to myself idk where I've gotten the idea that I need to be strong and crying is weakness.

I tried talking to my husband last  night and I was having a hard time talking. He ended up leaving and just sleeping in the livingroom which didnt help this situation. 

I miss my mom
I miss my sister
I really fuckin miss my friends. God do I miss thier hugs so damn much

I can't see myself past 25. I am now 25.,"For the longest time, I couldn't see myself living past 25. This mostly came about towards the last year of University and got worse around the end of 2017, when I wasn't landing work. 

In 2018, I met someone and suddenly I felt alive again. I felt calm and collected. Although I was stuck in the same loop of applying for work, it didn't feel as tiresome. In 2019, I got accepted into medicine and moved overseas. My partner starts tearing us apart 3 weeks into my move... I drop out of med school because the stresses from the break up became way too much to handle. Especially since I was overseas.

Now I am back to applying for jobs in my old degree and getting nowhere. I am heavily depressed. I can't see myself past 25 again. I have this strong feeling I will die this year. 

Atm, I welcome death with open hands...

Hey,"I posted it here and people didn't believe me back then, I cared about it before but I don't care anymore.

I'm serving in the military and I feel shit about it.
I feel broken inside, I changed in a very bad way.

I started having brake-downs and even wetting the bed.

I feel embarrassed, ashamed, and the worse part is that I still have 2 years left (I served 1 year so far).

I haven't told anyone about wetting the bed as I'm not 4 years old. And frankly speaking I just don't want to think about it.

I'm thinking about just ending it sometimes... But I don't want to cause my family and friends any unnecessary sorrow.

Is it bad that I hate being around my family,I hate being around my family I get uneasy and start to get irritated. Both my dad and mom were alcoholics and physically and emotionally abusive in the past. Now I don’t even talk to them and when I do it’s in a robotic tone. I don’t hate my parents and I do sometimes feel bad for not being close to them but I can’t ignore how I feel. I don’t enjoy their company but I want the best for them. And before you judge me and call me a selfish son I wanna let you know that I’ve been beat with wires and fist my feet hands and mouth were once taped while I was beat. The abuse stopped when I started fighting back. They are also very controlling my mom is always on my back always hovering over me and I’m kinda annoyed by her she treats me like a little boy and like I can’t do nothing for myself.

i’m happy and it feels wrong,"i’ve struggled with depression for about 6-7 years (pre- high school. now i’m a sophomore in college). a lot of my sadness has come from relationships, being stuck in a shitty town, having friends but not having any GOOD friends, blah blah. i can confidently say i’m over my most recent breakup and i don’t really have any crushes on anyone, so that part of my depression has kinda weirdly disappeared? i don’t live at home so i finally have the freedom to go wherever and do whatever i want. i have the best friends i could ask for and some awesome roommates. my classes this semester are so low stress it’s kind of annoying and i’ve picked up new hobbies that are fun and make me feel good. 

but now i have a new problem. i’m happy. i think i’m like actually happy, or at least i’m content with how my life is going currently. but it feels wrong? i feel like i shouldn’t be happy and i feel guilty for feeling this way. i can’t remember one time in my life where i felt like this and it’s scary. like really scary. a very small part of me wants to go back and do something drastic to send me into another depression. but at the same time i’m like, no this is what you’ve been wanting your whole life don’t fuck it up now! just enjoy it! but it’s hard to enjoy because now i’m uncomfortable. this is all foreign and new and i don’t like it. sure, i was sad all the time before and could barely muster the energy to get out of bed and shower or eat, but as least i was comfortable. 

has anyone else ever felt like this? i feel kinda shitty for being uncomfortable and i just wanna know i’m not alone. i totally understand if i get 0 sympathy (like, who complains about being content with life?), but i really feel wrong. it’s like i lost a huge defining piece of myself and now i have no idea who i’m supposed to be or how i’m supposed to act without it.",zxndxr,2,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/feakna/im_happy_and_it_feels_wrong/,struggled depression 6 7 year pre high school sophomore college lot sadness ha come relationship stuck shitty town friend good friend blah blah confidently say recent breakup really crush anyone part depression ha kinda weirdly disappeared live home finally freedom go wherever whatever want best friend could ask awesome roommate class semester low stress kind annoying picked new hobby fun make feel good new problem happy think like actually happy least content life going currently feel wrong feel like happy feel guilty feeling way remember one time life felt like scary like really scary small part want go back something drastic send another depression time like wanting whole life fuck enjoy hard enjoy uncomfortable foreign new like sure wa sad time could barely muster energy get bed shower eat least wa comfortable ha anyone else ever felt like feel kinda shitty uncomfortable wanna know alone totally understand get 0 sympathy like complains content life really feel wrong like lost huge defining piece idea supposed supposed act without,happy feel wrong,zx nd x r
Better days coming.,"So I’ve struggled with depression on and off my whole life. I graduated recently and was lucky enough to land a pretty decent job. However, since I’ve moved and started the job I’ve relapsed heavy. I know it’s common for people to be lonely when making a big move and being in a new environment. I tried to end it all when I was in hs and told myself I would never go back to that place. I decided to get help a few months ago when those thoughts came back and I’m glad I did. I won’t bore you with all the details but work was the reason for a lot of my issues so i decided to be proactive and change it. Well today i just got an offer at a company that I’ve wanted to work at since I started college! And best of all it’s back in the same town as all my friends who graduated with me. I know I will be happy there, more so than this place. And I’ll be surrounded by people who made me enjoy my life for those short 4 years. I’m hoping this was the change that I was looking for. I made every excuse as to why nothing would get better and to just live it out. I start next month!

Btw I signed up for BetterHelp for my therapy. It’s not for everyone but I’m very shy and have had bad experiences with psychiatrist and counselors. It was just more excuses I made to not get help.",Earwaxking,0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/fehh65/better_days_coming/,struggled depression whole life graduated recently wa lucky enough land pretty decent job however since moved started job relapsed heavy know common people lonely making big move new environment tried end wa h told would never go back place decided get help month ago thought came back glad bore detail work wa reason lot issue decided proactive change well today got offer company wanted work since started college best back town friend graduated know happy place surrounded people made enjoy life short 4 year hoping wa change wa looking made every excuse nothing would get better live start next month btw signed betterhelp therapy everyone shy bad experience psychiatrist counselor wa excuse made get help,better day coming,earwax king

Getting pummeled from all sides,"I'm drowning over here. I'm failing every single person in my life, being criticized by every single person in my life, being controlled by every single person in my life, and I don't know how to deal.

My abusive ex is fighting for custody of our daughter. He'll be granted overnights in a few weeks, when he's never spent more than six hours with her. She's going to be so scared. She's too young to understand why her mom isn't there. I've tried suggesting we transition slowly but he's refusing to do so unless I give him six more hours a week, ""in good faith.""

I have two weeks to pay $2k to a court appointed person, that I didn't ask for and can't get rid of, or I'll be held in contempt of court, resulting in a fine or jail time, even though I'm unemployed for another couple months. My dad is well able to help, but won't, because he ""doesn't want to get involved,"" but not because he isn't financially able.

My boyfriend is completely minimizing AND demonizing my feelings. Every single time I point out a problem, he plays victim and turns it around on me. When he picks on me and it hurts my feelings, I just need to toughen up and trust that he doesn't mean it. When I get upset that he tells me what to do, I just need to let go of this hatred for imagined authority. When he's super stressed to the point of being 85% negative all the time and I'm feeling neglected and unloved because of it, I just need to keep my feelings to myself because he doesn't need guilt on top of his stress.

My baby has been sick so she hasn't been sleeping well. She woke up at 4:30 this morning, when she normally gets up at 6:30, and I was trying to get her back down. Well I also live with my parents. And my stepdad told my mom that I was yelling at my daughter and stomping around the room to intimidate her, which isn't at all true. When I told my boyfriend that I was being stern with her, not yelling, he said that maybe I should change my stern voice because apparently it scares people. 

So yes, let me just do whatever the fuck everyone wants me to do and be who they want me to be because I have no autonomy or authority over my over damn life. Let me stop expressing my emotions, which means stop having emotions all together, to please all these fuckers in my life. Let me change something I don't even feel I'm doing *wrong* just to make someone else fucking happy.

And if I'm not happy?

Well, that's just too bad! Because apparently everyone else's feelings matter but mine.

I don't want to die, but I can't fucking live like this. Every waking moment of my life is just trying to please someone else. It's putting everyone else above me because if I don't, I'll be chastised or belittled or berated. No one can just let me be me and do what I do because they think they have some fucking hold on me and should be able to control what I do and say and think and feel.

I can't fucking LIVE like this. Who fucking can? But there's no way out. I'm unemployed until the summer. So I have to live with my parents. I have to listen to their bullshit. I can't get my ex to stop stalking me and harassing me and insulting me. The court is refusing to hold him accountable. I can't force my dad to keep me out of jail for something I have zero control over. I can't get my boyfriend to be more considerate of my feelings, but I can't break up with him either because then I'll *completely* fall apart. Those good moments with him are literally the only things keeping me functioning.

I honestly feel like if I didn't have skin, I'd be shattered. Not even just shattered, in pieces. Like a broken piece of tempered glass, split into so many pieces that they're impossible to count, and I get cut by them every single time I move. Just a walking, breathing flesh bag of blood and fragments.

Weeks ago I decided to stop contacting my friends, I disabled my social networks. Maybe that makes things easier.

I can't forget things that hurt me, since I wask a kid. These things still in looping in my head. And I can't forgive my ex for never helping me, for leaving me in a worse situation and then abandoning me after taking everything from me, after I helped him until my last cent. I hate and love him, and I was hoping that he would regret what he did to me, and help me as I helped him.  But noooo. He said ""I will never forget you, but we will never see each other again"" as if I had already died. He knows I will. He acts like I'm already gone.

"Chronic Harm OCD sufferer experiencing awful depression, advice?","Hello. Depression has always been a secondary problem for me, with my main antagonist being severe Harm OCD. But since my relationship ended 8 months ago, I've been stuck in this horrific cycle of absolutely loathing myself, feeling heavy/tired and totally unmotivated to do anything. It's like I'm living in a 2 dimensional world. Nothing in life jumps out and catches my attention like it used to. I used to be quite creative but it's just taken a nose dive. Any work I do is utterly awful and I'm amazed I'm not been kicked off projects (I work freelance). I wake up and I just want to be dead, quite honestly. In fact in the last few weeks I've even found getting out of bed to be a monumental struggle in itself, where I'm almost in tears from the weight of everything.

I am getting help with a therapist and am on an SSRI/low dose anti psych. And I've taken their advice seriously in terms of behavioural activation and avoiding staying in bed. I've started cycling again (just done 20 miles today in fact). But I still feel utterly wretched and everything I do is laced with this horrible belief that this is the end and suicide is my only way out of the pain I'm going through. The years ahead fill me with dread (I'm in my 30s). With my Harm OCD I have a huge hatred of myself anyway, but lately things have just got so heavy. I'd just like to know if anybody can relate to my post and has any first person advice? Psychiatrists and therapists always feel so removed from the reality (for me, anyway) - I'd just like to hear from people who know what's like and have helped themselves.",WishIwasNormal123,2,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/fedu8v/chronic_harm_ocd_sufferer_experiencing_awful/,hello depression ha always secondary problem main antagonist severe harm ocd since relationship ended 8 month ago stuck horrific cycle absolutely loathing feeling heavy tired totally unmotivated anything like living 2 dimensional world nothing life jump catch attention like used used quite creative taken nose dive work utterly awful amazed kicked project work freelance wake want dead quite honestly fact last week even found getting bed monumental struggle almost tear weight everything getting help therapist ssri low dose anti psych taken advice seriously term behavioural activation avoiding staying bed started cycling done 20 mile today fact still feel utterly wretched everything laced horrible belief end suicide way pain going year ahead fill dread 30 harm ocd huge hatred anyway lately thing got heavy like know anybody relate post ha first person advice psychiatrist therapist always feel removed reality anyway like hear people know like helped,chronic harm ocd sufferer experiencing awful depression advice,wish wa normal 123
My friend saved my life today,"You’ve probably haven’t heard from me since I made that concerning post awhile ago, then me deleting it. Welp I’m alive still, but I was very close to ending it today. My head was spiraling more than I’ve ever felt, and light started to blur and noise was distorted. Keep in mind, I wasn’t dying or gaining out of consciousness, I was just walking around my school and I heard the noise of a helicopter, while the sunset was gleaming in my eye. I was just trying to find that damn helicopter since that noise was just consuming me, and my whole world was vanishing, and I lost my meaning completely. I just wanted to end it. I didn’t know how, but I knew I wouldn’t be alive tomorrow. My mind was gone.

I then sat down and cried. Through the hole of the tables outside, I saw a pair of converse. While crying and trying to hide my tears from the cheer team that just got back from practice, I saw friend’s converse who had just came back from 711. They were surprised to see me there, and gave me the rest of their iced coffee. They didn’t know I was crying since I played it off that I was sleeping. We spent another 30 minutes eating brownies and talking about our day.

First Therapy Sessions: sliding scale?,"Hi

I'm going to be seeing a therapist for the first time in a while, at the urging of my partner. For a long time, I've felt like my problems did not warrant a therapy session, so I am just now taking my situation more seriously. I can't continue on like this and I know it. so I'm going.

My problem is that I have minimal insurance (500$ for the year for mental health). My new therapist works on a sliding scale, but I don't know how much to pay. She's given me 100$ as an option, then I got overwhelmed and she told me to think about what I thought was fair. I might be able to get on my partner's insurance at some point, but I have no idea when,

I'm now terrified of not being able to afford therapy, because I can feel myself getting close to a breaking point.

"I was in relationship years ago with someone who dealt with depression, and I just found out my current SO started self harming, not sure how far back it goes.","I’m trying to understand what’s going on with my current SO, I don’t fully understand depression nor do I understand self harm. 
I spent 4 years with my ex who was severely depressed and had suicidal tendencies at his worst points. I tried so hard to be there for him but I eventually gave up when he forced me to leave him because he knew I would be better off without him. 

Now I’m with my current boyfriend, who has been amazing and my rock, but he just revealed that his cuts are actually his own doing. I’ve only seen it twice. He’s a normal happy guy with some family troubles, sometimes financial but he handles things rather well and optimistically. It’s hard to gauge him at times because he’s generally a happy guy but he breaks down easily when things start to pile on, understandably so. He is nowhere near how I would describe someone who is depressed, but now I’m not so sure because of the SH. 
Can someone help me understand what he might be going through? Should I be worrying for his life? I’m heartbroken because I hate seeing this pain he’s going through. I thought it was something I wouldn’t have to go through again, it was hard going through it in the past. I feel selfish for feeling like this, I feel almost upset that this is happening.

I'm afraid to try a different treatment that might really help me.,"So my depression is *very* treatment-resistant. I've lost track of how many different meds and med combos I've tried. Recently it was suggested that I try TMS (Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation), which has been proven to be effective for depression like mine. My psychiatrist referred me to the doctor who does it, but I've been putting off actually making the appointment because I'm scared.

You know how sometimes people don't like taking meds because they make them feel like they're not themselves anymore; like they make them feel numb or empty? It's sort of like that, except in reverse. I've had my depression for well over a decade, more than half my life, and I literally can't imagine what it'd be like if it actually got better. Would I still feel like me? I know that things would improve, obviously, but change is scary, and in a bizarre way, my depression is comfortable. It's been a constant for most of my life and I don't know who I'd be without it.

Where to go?,"Hi, 

As the title suggests, where to go or how to help yourself where my options are severely limited?
My GP can only organise pills for me. I have no way of acquiring a therapist. I have been severely depressed for past couple of weeks and mildly since about November.

I don't have a trusted parent, sibling or a friend that I could open up to. I tried a while ago but I ask to support me in functioning day to day, pushing me to work and they just tell me they're sorry or they wish they could help. You know, the empty ""You can talk to me, it will get better"". Then they cut contact. My boyfriend just says he doesn't know how to help me and has phases of randomly complimenting me or texting me to tell me he loves me for two days straight then he forgets all about it. I'm sure he tries his best but I just wish I had more support and he says ""he can't help me anymore than he does"" everytime. I feel so trapped. I always have to pretend I'm fine. I always cover up with humor. It seems like I'm insincere or dramatic when I finally snap and just say I'm a mess. 

I can't afford a therapist. My university counselling office won't help me. They offered a suicide hotline numbers (?) and  ""we're sorry but this isn't a psychological support that we do here"".

How to cope? Where to go?

"I’m 21, just recently realized my dad is a terrible person and my childhood fucked me up more than anyone can see. I feel hopeless and have no life skills. Think my family is cursed(?)","My dad is an immigrant and came the US in his 30’s after he married my 18 year old mother who was studying abroad in his home country.

He quickly became financially successful and moderately famous in his industry. Things that came to define him above anything else.

My parents had me 11 years into their marriage and I have no siblings. 

I was homeschooled for most of my childhood and super sheltered from everything in life. Never allowed to have sleepovers, rarely allowed to have friends over, had every moment of my life scheduled and micromanaged.  I was never encouraged to pursue anything except becoming a professional soccer player (which was never what I wanted to do, but something my dad wanted me to do as a way to live out his dreams through me vicariously.) 

He was never around. He financially supported me and my mom and lived in the same city as us most of the time, but was never there to parent me and was rarely even around on holidays or birthdays. He kept his things at our house, but came home maybe once a month, sometimes less. He always said he needed to be closer to work so he was staying at his friend’s house (everything in the whole city is a 30 minute drive or less, and he never worked for anyone but himself.) 

Now that I’m an adult, I understand he was living with various girlfriends though he was still married to my mom, and she always seemed to be waiting up for him to come home and finally be a dad/husband. 

I developed severe anorexia at 12, and my family seemed to ignore it even though I stopped growing, lost 40 pounds, was rarely eating, and was exercising 4-6 hours a day. When I was literally weeks away from death with a BMI of &lt;12, my mom finally took me to a doctor after my grandma begged her to because “something was really wrong with me.” The doctor told her I was  anorexic and recommended in-patient treatment and psychotherapy. My mom yelled at the doctor, said “there’s no way MY daughter is anorexic,” and stormed out of the office. 

For the next 6 months or so, I stayed at the same weight and, nightly, would sit down at the dinner table with my mom and cry for hours while she screamed at me to finish my food. I never went to therapy for the eating disorder and she denied every doctor who told her I was mentally ill. She was SURE I had tapeworms, a thyroid disease, celiac, or some other ailment that had caused me to lose 40% of my body weight. I stayed at a dangerously low weight until I was 16, which is the first year I went to school, and traded my ED for nightly sneaking out, binge drinking, and bulimia. 

When I was 16, I was almost arrested for trying to buy alcohol, and my dad found out and told me if I wanted alcohol I could just ask him. He started helping me sneak out and giving me alcohol whenever I wanted. I think he did this to drive a wedge between my mom and me, he always loved to have secrets that we would keep from her. He would take me around his 23 year old girlfriend and tell me to not tell my mom. In fact, he would blackmail me, saying things like “don’t tell mom about so and so, you would hate for her to find out about you sneaking out and partying right?” 

When I was 17, my dad lost all his businesses and wealth, and has still been unable to recover from the financial loss. He pinned all his happiness on money, and once it was gone he changed completely. Every time I’ve talked to him since then, all he’s talked about is how broke he is and how my mom caused his financial ruin and what a stupid idiot she is. He curses my mom around me almost every time he talks to me.

He had a long talk with me one night when I was 16. He told me that I should never have kids because they’ll ruin my life. He never wanted kids. He would be a multi millionaire and so happy and free if he had never had a family. My mom is a crazy lunatic and has only ruined his life and finances. 

I fell into a horribly abusive, 4 year relationship with a guy when I was 17. I bounced around from college to vocational school, and also had a moderately successful entertainment career. I’ve never been able to find footing anywhere. I feel like I can’t connect with anyone. I really don’t feel passion for anything and don’t feel like there’s any path in life that I want to take, though I do feel like I’m talented in multiple things. I’m awful at romantic relationships and friendships (maybe because I never had a healthy relationship example from my family, and never had long term friendships when I was growing up?) 

About a year ago, I was talking with my dad about how I wanted to get a job that made a lot of money like bottle service. He suggested I become a stripper. And so I did. I danced for a year, and he insisted I call him and tell him how much money I made every night, and he acted like I was so lucky because he “gave me permission” to do this. Like wtf I’m a grown adult who’s been living on my own since 18, and god knows I was putting in the work all on my own for all the money I made. 

Every time I see him he’s so negative and toxic and I realize now that a lot of the anxiety and problems I felt as a child (I’ve been suicidal literally since I can remember) stemmed from the insane toxic energy that always engulfed my family life. 

I’ve done a lot of psychedelics, and I really do have a good grip on spirituality and mindfulness, and know there’s something way bigger than this earth plane we live on. There are light forces and dark forces. The thing is, lately, I just don’t feel like I am meant to be blessed by the light forces. Like I was born out of darkness from a cursed family, and I am doomed to be miserable, depressed, and toxic just like my dad. He is not a good person. I think he’s a narcissistic sociopath and it scares me that half of my genes come from that. 

His dad was a total narcissist, no respect for women, I felt unexplainably awful vibes from him always. My paternal grandfather had a very successful business when he was younger, but somehow that all dissolved and he ended up completely broke with nothing to leave to his family, dementia, and a mindset that his children should take care of him (which they did, until his death last year.) My aunt put herself through unspeakable stress and pain to take care of my grandfather, who was completely ungrateful for it. 

Most of my dad’s family has ended up in a mental hospital by 70, and they’re all completely depressed or mentally ill, and I feel the same demons taking me under every day. I’ve felt dark forces around me since I can remember. I’ve seen my demons during nightmares and sleep paralysis. I think my abusive ex-boyfriend was influenced by the demons that follow me around. 

I can’t see anything good happening in my life long term. I fear I’m going to end up like everyone on my dad’s side. I recently talked about a lot of this stuff with my mom and she started crying and said she’s failed me in every way, she should’ve left my dad when I was little, and she wishes she never even married him because she was a teenager and literally only knew him for a few months before they got married. That hit so hard, because it just made me feel like my whole life was never even supposed to happen. I was just part of one giant fucked up mistake made by a naive 18 year old. 

I feel like I’m a lost soul, I wasn’t meant to exist, and because of that the dark energy got ahold of me. 

I don’t want to talk to my dad anymore. Am I wrong? I am questioning everything and I really hope I don’t live that long because I don’t see anyone in that family having any glimmer of a nice life over age 55. 

No one takes me seriously when I say my childhood fucked me up so much, because I grew up with a lot of material possessions, money, and a seemingly super involved mother. When people think of bad childhoods, they think of poverty, physical abuse, druggie parents, things like that. Maybe I’m a spoiled brat. But either way I’m just not happy, I can’t remember ever, ever being happy for more than a couple days at a time.

To all of those feeling isolated and suffering right now...,"I’ve learned that life is fucking sad sometimes. You start to think that maybe things aren’t going to get better at all. I’ve been at points which I think, it can’t get worse than this, but then I discover a new section of rock bottom, thinking, ah this is it!

 I assure you, There’s always something worse than what you’re going through. It can get worse. Per that same logic, there’s always the chance it gets better. I think I hold onto that and you should too.

 You might have realised at some point, people in your life leave. They come and go, and the only constant in your life is you. You have your back, and that’s what matters at the end of the day. Keeping this in mind, Take care of yourself and be proactive towards seeking friendships and human connections whenever possible. We humans are social creatures, so having this emotional connection can literally save you. It saved me, at least. 

I’m sorry about whatever situation you are facing it right now, but do know that you have a power to improve it. At this point, things can either improve or worsen, and the amazing this is that you have the choice.",never-mind-la,0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/fega6j/to_all_of_those_feeling_isolated_and_suffering/,learned life fucking sad sometimes start think maybe thing going get better point think get worse discover new section rock bottom thinking ah assure always something worse going get worse per logic always chance get better think hold onto might realised point people life leave come go constant life back matter end day keeping mind take care proactive towards seeking friendship human connection whenever possible human social creature emotional connection literally save saved least sorry whatever situation facing right know power improve point thing either improve worsen amazing choice,feeling isolated suffering right,never mind la
My relationship with Instagram.,"My relationship with Instagram is complicated. While I do see it as a good way to promote certain things like my amateur photography for example, I also feel like it’s repetitive to an extent. I feel like whenever I go on there, it’s mostly the same old kinds of posts. Gym selfies, selfies in general, people who brag about their rich lifestyles, the list goes on and on. Witnessing those kinds of posts over and over just ain’t good for my social anxiety and depression.

"When you lose the will to live, you got a big fucking problem","No longer have any passion for my interests, or even any passion for life tbh. Im lonely af, feel worthless and hopeless. I dont want to kill myself though my mind tells me i do. But id much rather be happy, thrive and prosper. Its strange for sure. I'd like to say im a hard worker, im intuitive and a problem solver. There's things i aspire to do, and know im phyiscally and mentally capable of doing in one part of my mind. 

The other part that's always lurking is telling me im a worthless piece of shit and cant do anything and that even if i was successful still nobody would care so whats the point. Recently ive been losing the battle with that other part, and when my mind tries to rationalise my life situation (which isnt even that bad) and thoughts, the conclusion it comes to, is self termination. Sometimes i get too overwhelmed by it and imagine having a gun and pointing it under my chin. I pull the trigger and imagine it all going away almost instantly. It doesnt make me feel better as i do it in moments i might have legit pull the trigger in the heat of the moment. It makes the real me glad i dont have a gun (i live in uk so i cant really get one all that easily anyway).

Edit: I'm feeling calmer now, my demons have been but to bed until tomorrow (i hope). Just want to add, most of the things that my mind perceives as major fucking problems like having no friends or girfriend can be overcome, its not a terminal illness, even if my mind wants me to see it that way. I say this to people a lot but i believe it, with a healthy mind there isnt much a human cant overcome. Look at tyson fury, he was a pork pie with the jelly around it, he was a coke addict. And by getting help with his mental health hes now heavy weight champion of the world. Then people like caroline flack (sorry if i misspelled) got herself in a pretty bad sitaution, and her mental health issues made it seem 1000x worse to her. With a healthy mind she could have gone to court and taken her punishment, and dealt with the repercussions. It would have been hard as heck and taken a toll on her for sure. But it could have been done.

Wanting to die or kill yourself is not a rational thought. Theres nothing rational at all about poor mental health. I think it has helped me a lot understanding the science a lil bit. Just the fact that these chemical imbalances can fuck us up in so many ways. Thinking about that definitely helps bring perspective.",HelloThere2818,7,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/fe39an/when_you_lose_the_will_to_live_you_got_a_big/,longer passion interest even passion life tbh im lonely af feel worthless hopeless dont want kill though mind tell id much rather happy thrive prosper strange sure like say im hard worker im intuitive problem solver thing aspire know im phyiscally mentally capable one part mind part always lurking telling im worthless piece shit cant anything even wa successful still nobody would care whats point recently ive losing battle part mind try rationalise life situation isnt even bad thought conclusion come self termination sometimes get overwhelmed imagine gun pointing chin pull trigger imagine going away almost instantly doesnt make feel better moment might legit pull trigger heat moment make real glad dont gun live uk cant really get one easily anyway edit feeling calmer demon bed tomorrow hope want add thing mind perceives major fucking problem like friend girfriend overcome terminal illness even mind want see way say people lot believe healthy mind isnt much human cant overcome look tyson fury wa pork pie jelly around wa coke addict getting help mental health heavy weight champion world people like caroline flack sorry misspelled got pretty bad sitaution mental health issue made seem 1000x worse healthy mind could gone court taken punishment dealt repercussion would hard heck taken toll sure could done wanting die kill rational thought nothing rational poor mental health think ha helped lot understanding science lil bit fact chemical imbalance fuck u many way thinking definitely help bring perspective,lose live got big fucking problem,hello 2818

"I don't have depression. but I need advice, I tried to post in so many Sub Reddits but it keeps deleting","Hey, I'm in a 14 year old female (9th grade), and right now I'm in a low point in my life ( no I am not one of those im14andthisisdeep girls haha). At the moment I really don't want to discuss everything yet, but there is this one situation I do.

ALSO please mind that I am bad at expressing myself, so this may sound repetitive.

I'll try to list everything...

My friend group consists of around 9 people (I think, it keeps adding up, and I'll explain later). There is this girl in my ""friend group"" (can't really say 'friends"" because I am not really close to them) who keeps avoiding me. She started to avoid me around the start of the school year. She started show her dislike around me when my friends were talking jokingly, (I can't recall properly, sorry) that if they were not going to receive any flowers in Valentines Day, hence saying some people in my friend group do, they would group up and watch a movie together. I was curious, so I asked something related to it (sorry, can't remember exactly :(, I think I said something like ""Oh! What movie?"" or ""When?"" (like when would this event take place) ). She then rudely replies with ""Who are YOU!?"". This other girl from my friend group just stared at me (Not in a rude way, but in a way I can't read her expression) I was kind of hurt then.

This behaviour kept continuing. Around a few days later, I went to the spot where my friends sat, and sat next to the girl who apparently dislikes me. She IMMEDIATELY stood up and rushed (no kidding, she ran away from me) to the opposite side, and sat there. I just blankly stared at her, again hurt the frick for me. The group stayed silent, then same girl who looked at me then said ""Oh, I know why"".

Because of this, I was in a shit mood. The shittiest mood I've been compared to the whole day. I was walking to my HSIE class (where 2 of my other ""friends"" were in). I asked one of them, (for her privacy, I'll call her ""Sally"") why (let's call her Fiona) keeps avoiding me. Sally replies saying I said something to Fiona *A FEW MONTHS AGO* that pissed her off. Sally then tells me to not worry, and that Fiona is a *""petty person""* . (Honestly, I thought okay, wtf? I actually was actually tearing up a bit due to sadness, not to the extent of crying though)

Timeskip to a few days, (with Fiona going to the opposite side of the friend circle *As AlWaYs!1!,* and with me now, I try no to be near her, but even being the slight nearest, she goes even further away). I asked someone who was friends/close to Fiona while going out of my commerce class to the next period. I explained the situation to her (*whilst clinging to the edge of the wall like that Yandere girl from Yandere simulator because I am awkward af, seriously*). She also responds to something similar. She said Fiano used to act up like that to her and I just need to get used to it. (I was tearing up AgAin (not to the extend to cry) \*le fucking sigh\*). She then adds ""Oh, you don't like it?"". She then says something similar that Sally said before ""She is just petty"" (ugh so tired of hearing that word from everyone).

Timeskip\~\~

She keeps avoiding me, not sitting next to me. Recently I was going to the bathroom with another girl, whilst walking back to class, Fiona responds ""Hey -name-"" and ignores me (wow, how nice...). When I talk, she glares at me. And more, more, MORE negative reactions to me.

Today, I had HSIE class after lunch. I was 'complaining' (not in an annoying way) about how boring it was. And then fucking Piano responds with ""Maybe if you had friends"".

I pause, literally a flash of emotions hit me: hurtfulness, pain, frustration, anger, you name it. I had just enough with her play and said something around (maybe I should of responded differently, more direct? and not nicely?) ""Why do you hate me, whatever you did, just tell me, I will say sorry"" and blah blah blah. (Sorry, I only started to notice I was too kind this year, and that it lead to me being hurt, and people taking the advantage to go on top of me (yeah, there are a few girls, again? why would you hate me?, who dislike me. I won't talk about it because this thread would be WAYYY too long) ).

Fiona then replies with ""Nothing/No you did nothing wrong. \*I just hate you."" .\*I was spreading in a bad mood. Bad morning, had a maths test, didn't sleep because I was staying up studying and also extremely VERY stressed!

The group went silent, stopped talking. I had enough, I don't want to be apart of the group (explain later). I don't want to be near HER. I. fucking.had.enough. I abruptly left the group (sorry, should've mentioned earlier, but I do that more and more often when she does something shitty to me) and walked around, staring at happy (I mean I don't really know) people with their friends, fake smiling.(ugh for some reason I approached some closely just to stare at them.

Ugh fucking amazing life.

Also I will talk about my friends now.

They weren't a fixed group, especially around 8th grade. You know when there is a new student, and the teacher would just ~~force~~ put them in your group? Well, welcome to mine!

Anyways, my group is basically where new people come. There has been 1 from 8th grade (never met her before) and an old friend who came back(left). There would be another girl who would hang out in my group and another one (that one more now). This year, 9th grade, already on our 6th week, 2 girls were introduced (I don't even remember their names).

There are certain things that creates a friend group. For example, if you like books, you stay with bookworms (the ""bookworm group""). Because of this (tho, nothing like that made me feel close to my friends), my friends group isn't so closely connected to one another. Like lunch is so fucking boring now. When was the last time I had fun during recess or lunch?(Note\_ 4 out of 5 days I have school meetings on lunch, just SRC things!) Now people just eat due to boredom, and half of them go on their phones. No (little) interactions created. I am quiet, but not the most quiet in the group, now I am. When they talk, they laugh, I don't.

But seriously, I never felt close to my friends, they would go to parties, parks, movies with each other, where am I? at home. They had photos posted on instagram one time of them in a party. They tagged each other, not including ME (only one, thanks. Btw not close to her though). They printed photo cards of those pictures and shared them to each other as memory (some are on their phone case). One picture was the korean hand heart (that saranghaeyo thingy) they made together as a circle. (Wow, like that didn't;t hurt)

Im not close to them, I feel lonely being around them, and I have no one to talk to, no one to trust. Where do I go now? How do I make friends? Because of this, I've reached out bout my loneliness online (in a few different platforms) to talk to. It's nicer to talk to someone online though.. They don't know me and keep this secret...

Sorry, this was longer than I thought. There is more I want to talk about (I never thought something that I thought was small would end up being this long). I may post some more in the future.

If there is something you want me to elaborate on, please feel free to ask! (But I won't respond if it is too personal hehe).

I think this is my final straw and I am scared,"Warning: this is VERY long. I'm not sure what the purpose of it really is but just wanting to put this out there in the world. Maybe I'll get some advice, maybe someone will read it and realize they are not alone.

I’ve started writing this so many times and lost motivation half way through. This is yet another attempt, let’s see what happens.

I’m a 30 year old woman, I work as a photographer for a fashion company with a degree in Graphic Design, volunteer at a cat rescue 2 days a week, and suffer from depression and social/general anxiety disorder.

I first realized my teen angst wasn’t just a “phase” sometime in my early 20’s. As a teenager I would do the normal things: drink, do drugs, smoke weed. I would also write a lot but this writing, in hindsight, was some of the deepest cries for help. I’ve since lost that precious notebook, but I did come upon snippets of that “poetry” in my other sketchbooks. The stuff wasn’t anything out of the ordinary - I grew up listening to emo and other such heart wrenching music - and the style was really just lyrics trying to artistically describe the dark cloud that was inside of me every minute of every day. I lost interest in that activity around the age of 20.

I was always a shy person. I played with friends during school, but I was never allowed to have anyone over or go to anyone’s house. As a result, I was always found by myself in the yard skipping rope alone. My parents brought me to Canada when I was 9 years old in order to expand my options for education. I was born in Russia where there wasn’t much choice at the time to do anything with your life other than engineering, medicine or teaching. In that aspect, I thank them. I was able to attend an art school in Toronto and attain my Graphic Design degree which my anxious artistic brain appreciates.

When I arrived in Canada I didn’t speak much English and was in an ESL program. In that first year, 4th grade, I was bullied for not speaking the language. Some girls quickly realized that it would be fun to put rocks (the little pebbles from the playground) down my pants while we had “carpet time” (when all the kids gather around crossed legged on the floor in front of the teacher during a lesson.) They knew I wouldn’t say anything, partly because I couldn’t physically, partly because I couldn’t mentally. Kids would kick my chair constantly as they walked by, someone even throw things at me from the back. I brushed it off, went on with it. I did have two great friends (one of which is still in my life albeit we aren’t close.)

This childish bullying subsided after the first year. I went off to another school in grade 5 after moving buildings with my parents. 6th grade was split. It was yet another school (moving from elementary to middle school) and then half way through 6th grade, after establishing quite a solid group of new friends, I was transferred to a new school after yet another move by my parents. I had to start over with the friend thing and luckily I befriended a girl right away. She was also an outcast, being extremely tiny and skinny for her age and also didn’t fit in with the “cool popular kids.” Here I was laughed and looked down upon for being new, having 1 friend, and being so extremely shy. After a while I became close with another girl, let’s call her Jessica. 7th grade went by bearably with her around, outside minor incidents like having the basketball thrown at my head during recess. I was also developing extremely bad acne, so I was doomed to be the ugly shy girl for the next few years.

Ending of 8th grade is where the real trouble started with Jessica. She had an “in” with the cooler kids in the grade and being so attached to her, I got to hang out with the group occasionally. This is where we started “relationships” with two boys. She was with lets call him Andrew and I was with let’s call him Mike. We would hang out after school a lot and one day I brought them all over to my house. Mike took me down to my parent’s cellar at one point and where I thought I would have my first kiss, my hands were forced down onto his penis. I didn’t know how to retaliate so I went with it. Instead of a first kiss, I gave my first hand job. The next time we hung out was at the movies. I was brought to the bathroom for what I thought was a make out session but turned out to be an attempt at a blow job. I can’t remember whether I went through with it, I just remember crying that evening. I soon found out that Andrew and Mike had a bet going of who would get their dick sucked first and Jessica agreed to bring me into the group so they could use me for that bet. These things bled into high school. The rumours started that I was a slut and were reinforced with photos being distributed throughout the school. The photos were of me wearing see through mesh pants in provocative poses that Jessica took of me in her room one night when we were having a fun “fashion” night. She wore them too, although somehow the photos of her never got distributed. 

Finally a new girl came to the school lets call her Beth and finally things seemed to calm down. We had a great friendship going and were inseparable during high school (to the point where people were calling us lesbians.) I even attended her wedding two years ago, she’s a beautiful human being. I tried my best to have a normal life. I threw myself into art. I would come to school at 7 in the morning so spend time in the photography dark room lab. I got great marks in my classes and my teachers loved me. Of course throughout this time I did the regular teenage girl stuff. I liked boys, I would make out with them. I was already well trained in the hand job department so guys learned to hand me over to their friends once they were done with me. I just did it. It made them happy. And in my mind, that made me good at it. Why not do the thing that I felt I excelled at? Of course none of that behaviour helped the growing rumours. 

I first tried drugs in 10th grade. Beth and I would skip school, pop ecstasy, spend the day together. This went on for about a year in the 11th grade where my marks drastically plummeted. I’m not sure what the triggering factor for me to stop was, but I managed to graduate high school on the honour roll. At the end of 12th grade I met lets call him Sam. We dated for 2 years, I lost my virginity to him, but I will always remember doubting his intentions. Did he stay with me for the sex? Did he only want me around because I would smoke weed with him? It didn’t matter. I lost romantic interest in him after a year but stayed together despite us fighting because it was comfortable and a habit I just didn’t want to, or couldn’t break.

I got into my top school of choice and spent the first year working hard. After my break up with Sam, I met lets call him Dale. It was interesting at first. He would show up at my work almost daily and chat and finally we started going on real dates. He brought me gifts and showered with me with attention. I now realize that it was borderline stalker behaviour. He wouldn’t take no for an answer even if I didn’t really feel like doing anything. The thing with Dale is kind of an on and off ordeal. We were never fully together but would hang out often usually drinking or going on drives. I was starting to get really put off by him, but one night he insisted on hanging out. As you well know by now, I have trouble saying no. So we went to the bar, got a buzz going and then went driving. (I know how shameful it is to drink and I drive. I know first hand because I almost killed my friend during a drunk driving episode. I haven’t done it since and will never do it again.) We were in the car and I was completely insistent that this was a non sexual meet up. But he wouldn’t stop trying to kiss me, to push my hands on to his crotch, then pushing my head down, asking me to just suck it a little. I did it just to make him shut up so I could go home. I haven’t seem him since them. I refused to talk to him and eventually had to block him. To this day he tries to make attempts at communication but nothing dangerous. 

The truly destructive behaviour started around 22 when I began to frequent parties. At first it was drinking, and a lot of it. Then I met a 28 year old man lets call him Izack. He was a DJ and very much into the rave party scene. It was with him when I tried coke for the first time at the age of 23 or 24. Lets just call the rest a blur. I would party twice a week, heavily on drugs, go to school completely hung over. Long story short, I just managed to graduate, scraping by with a warning letter and passing marks given to me probably only out of the kindness of my professor’s heart. I loved Izack. He was older, had more experience, best sex I’ve ever had and he made me forget everything and everyone. He lived downtown in an apartment with two other roommates who also loved to party and we all got along quite well. The sanctuary of that apartment was heavenly. I would be able to spend all my time there away from my strict Russian parents. Then Izack started going on the road a lot more due to his DJ career flourishing. When he was away, I would come to his place and clean everything. I bought him a huge new TV for his room. I wanted him to come home to a beautiful place. In my mind that was me saying thank you for letting me stay with him rent free for so many days of the week. 

About a year into our relationship, I went for a gynaecologist check up which was followed by a phone call saying that I have an STD. They told me to get myself and my partner into the office so we could be given medication. It was nothing overly serious, cleared up with a few pills but I had to have a serious conversation with Izack. He swore on his life that he never cheated on me. He begged me to believe him which after hours upon hours of me crying and pleading, I finally did. But I never got over the nagging feeling that something wasn’t right. So after a month of uncertainty, over the phone on my birthday (I remember that day so clearly), I asked him one more time. I’m not sure what made him tell me truth this time around, but yes, of course he slept with someone on tour and yes that is how I contracted the STD.

I was a complete and utter wreck for the next few months. The drugs and alcohol increased. I went on Tinder and began my first sex binge. At one point I managed to sleep with 6 different men in one week. All I wanted to do was to forget the hurt and I didn’t know how. Again, all of this is very blurry so I can’t say the exact moment that Izack came back into my life but he did. I remember going to a bar to meet him to get closure, to finally say I forgive him and that I’m moving on. That meeting ended up with me in his apartment and sex. We then got “back together”, continued the destructive behaviour until his next tour where he slept with someone again. I let that one go easily since we never stated that we were officially a couple again. I think this is where I learned how to numb my brain from hurt. I wasn’t mad at him anymore, I just quietly walked away and threw myself into my second huge sex binge on Tinder. After a few months of this, I met a guy lets call him Jon. 

We dated for something close to a year. This relationship was also fuelled by alcohol, drugs and parties. But at this point I didn’t want another life. The relationship involved me crying almost every day at work with something abusive he may have said to me that day. For example, he loved to make me feel like an idiot for asking him why it took him hours to answer a text massage. I was told I was crazy on an almost daily basis. I will fast forward to the end, where a girl (who is now a friend) reached out to me saying that she was also dating Jon, for 6 months now. She spotted us at a party kissing, and lost her mind. Apparently she had no knowledge of me for the long while they were together. It turns out, that we weren’t the only ones. I came to the knowledge that he had slept with 8 different people during the span of being with me. This included his upstairs neighbour who I was constantly told not to worry about. 

I laughed at this. I didn’t cry, I didn’t feel angry, I laughed, pulled out my phone and on to the next Tinder binge I went.

It took me about 6 months to get into my next relationship. This one was with a kind man who would never do a thing to hurt me. It lasted for about 2 years. I met his parents and he met mine. We were talking about marriage and moving in together but it ended up falling apart during our search for an apartment. We just weren’t right for each other.

So this is where I am now. 30 years old, living back with my parents. I have since stopped the partying because that life doesn’t satisfy me anymore and my body can’t handle it. I have been coke free for about a year now mainly because I can’t afford it. But I drink. I drink several times a week because I can’t stand my job. I drink because I feel trapped in my own mind. I drink because of my living situation. I drink because nothing I do excites me. I drink about 3 times a week and once I crack a bottle of wine, there is no way I can stop. That bottle is getting drunk to the last drop and more often than not, a second one gets opened and lasts about half way until I pass out. 

The job thing - realized I’m the only one who can help myself there so I have been taking lots of photos and editing them in an effort to update my portfolio but sitting down and editing those photos sober just isn’t an option. I go to work, I laugh with my coworkers, but at the end of the day, the only thing that makes me happy and that I took forward to is that next drink. I started exercising and have been continuing to do so pretty consistently but I always fall off the boat because I can’t stay excited and motivated. 

Last night I came home to my collection of wine bottles all out and displayed in front of me by my dad. My mom discovered the first bottle in my closet when she couldn’t find my cat, or so she says. She then proceeded to go through every crevice of my room and pulled out the 20 or so I had hidden. Long story short, my life of drinking after work and during my own photo editing hours is over and I am terrified. I feel like I have nothing happy to come home to. I spent all last night crying and today is the first day I didn’t show up to work because of this. The thing is - I don’t know if I want to stop. I’ve had thoughts of suicide since my early teenage years and they have never gone away. I’ve cut myself on numerous occasions. I have dabbled with the idea of overdosing on my anxiety and depression medication. I did go into therapy for a few months but that turned out way too pricey for my minimal salary. My dad has offered to pay for my therapy last night, but this is an offer I’m not sure I want to take. I just want it to be over. The only times things are okay in my brain is when I am sleeping, or when I am heavily buzzed. I don’t have children, nor a boyfriend and I have maybe 2 friends, so I’m finding it difficult to see a purpose to go on. 

I would like to finish by saying how awful I feel about putting this out there. The amount of times the word “I” is used is upsetting and selfish since I know there are people out there who have it way worse than me. Like my parents have pointed out numerous times, I have nothing to be sad about. I have a good job, a warm house, food and water. I have a car that my dad so kindly gave to me when he bought himself a new one. And they are right. I have it so good. But inside, that dark cloud just won’t lift and there is no way I can describe it in words to someone who hasn’t felt the pull of it.

I think I need to leave my partner of 10 years,"My Girlfriend and I have been together for ten years and I don't know what to do anymore. She suffers from depression, anxiety and severe OCD.

Over the last couple of years here anxiety has worsened and over the last few months it's just too much for me, we don't see anybody anymore, if we do she has a panic attack before it and i've ended up having to cancel plans. It's our nieces third birthday party tomorrow and we were supposed to be going to stay up at my parents for the weekend and she doesn't want go. Fair enough, but I have been seeing my family less and less because of her needing her weekends to herself.

She's not from here so has no family or friends here who aren't mine so she really feels like she has nobody else but I'm exhausted. I can ask her family and friends from back home to talk to her but she doesn't want me to tell anyone. She believes she is just in the way and makes everyone's life shit, I try and tell her it's not true but it's so deep rooted into her mind that she just think she'd be better off dead, she's threatened suicide before so I feel like if I leave her even for this weekend she would kill herself as it's not really a threat but just her mindset of thinking she's better off dead. Idk anymore, I really don't. I don't even know if this is just kme being an asshole i'm just lost and confused and tired. I still love her but she just doesn't care about life anymore.

She stopped taking medication about a year ago as she thought it was making it worse, I respected her wishes and tbh, sometimes it seemed fine but lately it's absolutely not fine and she refuses to go back on any form of medication.

I lost my youth to school,"I know that a lot of people say that they lost their younger years to anxiety and depression. There is no doubt that I've definitely lost a lot of years to those same things, but I feel like a large portion of my life has been wasted in school. 

Of course there is a lot of useful things schools teaches that can be applied in every day life, but school has become the worst part of my day, which is especially troubling since it takes up such a large part of it. And after school, I'm just so drained and it makes me so sad to be alive. 

You'll probably have it in most school systems regardless of country, but American school are just such a shitty environment for people who have mental issues. How am I even supposed to properly deal with these issues when I'm constantly bombarded with all this schoolwork? How am I supposed to experience life and enjoy it when I'm trapped in an environment that worsens my mental health and anxiety? 

It's my last year of high school, but I still can't help but feel like I would be happier having dropped out. Realistically, the long term would look worse, but school environments are so toxic a lot of the time. The pressure to conform is just so strong and I don't know how other people feel, but it almost makes me hate being different, it makes me want to be ""normal""

I'm just venting a little. I don't know if this would really make sense to other people, tbh I'm kinda fucked up mentally right now cause school is a bitch.

Today was actually a good day.,"Hello everyone! I, as well as most people on the subreddit, have depression. I've been struggling with it for a few years. Recently I was prescribed with welbutrin. I must say that I cant express how much better I've been doing. I still have my moments at night but it's definitely not as bad. I've been struggling with my weight for a while as well but I was just laying in bed and had a weird switch get flipped and now I want to change my diet, i want to start going to the gym and be active. It's crazy because I'm lazy as fuck. Maybe doing this will help a lot with my depression. 

I'm scared though because a few years ago I broke my back while playing football. I was really active outdoors. I played football for the school, I kayaked, hiked, etc. Not being able to do those things has caused me to gain a bunch if weight and become insanely depressed. I lost feeling in my toes for 6 months after the initial accident. I wasn't able to do anything active. My toes are fine now but the fact that I'm not able to do what I used to do because of the accident has caused me to be depressed. I dont want to be depressed anymore, I'm sure everyone can relate. I want to get my life back the way it was and the only way I can do it is to step out of my comfort zone and find someone who will be willing to help me achieve my goal. 

Although it may be difficult, I know if I try my hardest I can achieve my goal. I apologize for the rant but this sudden change in my mindset has got me really motivated and honestly a bit emotional. I was scared I'd never find a way out of this rut. I'm also scared to lose this motivation. I dont want this to be a small fluke of motivation and then tomorrow I'm right back at where I was. But I shouldn't focus on tomorrow. 


Anyways again sorry for the rant but I couldn't bottle it up.

I’m starting to feel like I’m not meant for this world anymore,"I’m 17, and I’ve been feeling this way ever since I was 15. I have no friends, social anxiety and I’ve been homeschooled since I was 5. And to top it all off, I have asperger’s syndrome. I’d give away everything I have just to have at least one real friend who understands me and just to be normal.

My anxiety has gotten so bad that I can barely even go out anymore. I for some reason have a huge fear of kids around my age. I almost had a panic attack just for checking out my new college with my mum. I don’t think I’ll ever make it there. I like a lot of stuff that I’m sure no one my age likes and I get angry at my relatives for no reason. 

I hate being a teen. Why do hormones exist? Why is everything so complicated? Why am I losing my mind? I never used to have to worry about any of this shit as a little kid. I wish I could go back in time and undo whatever the fuck it was that made me this way. I come from a good family, so it’s not family related. Only thing I do is isolate myself from the entire world + my family by just staying in my room playing games and watching videos. I can’t do anything else.

Depression from Chronic Iniury,"Hi all, I’ve dealt with mild depression most of my life and handle it decently through medication, on and off therapy and CBT.  

However I’ve had 3 failed shoulder surgeries since 2016 and my shoulder pain triggers relapses into anger, depression, and feeling bad for myself.   I can’t play basketball anymore which I loved, I have trouble holding and playing with my two young daughters as well.  When I try something that I can no longer do (our daughter on my shoulders or shoot hoops in the driveway) it usually means I will be down for the rest of the day. 

I know people deal with much more serious strokes of misfortune than a bad arm but I often spiral into feeling bad for myself and being mad at myself for the basketball plays that led to the original injuries.  

Does anyone recommend a book, a method of CBT or any advice for me to deal with this better?

Am I faking my feelings?,"I've seen people question this before, but never identified with it enough to pay attention until now. So, here is the post.

I will frame unnecessary explanations with ""//"", in case anyone reading wants to skip. Although I'd like to warn you that this post is somewhat long regardless, as I like to explain things.

I've been considering myself unworthy (of a real friend, of feeling better, of complaining) since a long time, as I have a nice life, or because that I'm not feeling as bad as many other people who are said to be depressed. I obviously never wanted to be sad, nor to experience bad things, but I wanted to be worthy of some certain things I felt I needed. Over time I began feeling worse and worse, to a point where I compare myself more than I used to do, where almost everything upsets me. 

//For example, let's say there is a character I relate to and am happy about being alike. That used to be a source of motivation. Now when I see this character, I can only think of how much better this said persona is compared to myself, and how I can never be like them. When I look at something I value, rather than being happy I feel worried of what might happen to them. Or, when entering a new season I mourn the previous, alongside all the time I wasted.//

I'm mostly worried, stressed, or sad. The thing is that there is no clear reason for me to feel so. I sometimes question if I myself feel that way..



I also am having a hard time figuring my feelings for over a year. There are some occasions where I thought I didn't feel anything, but couldn't help crying.

The reason I'm writing this post is that, while watching a show, a character explained a 'negative' habit of the other, which I ultimately related to. It's not something I consider to be really bad. However, after that scene I couldn't somehow focus to the episode. My interest faded to a point. It was almost as if I was reacting to what was said, but I don't even care that much. The character cared, but not me. Was I impersonating his emotions? Or am I just faking all these to feel worthy? I cannot understand this. Am I really sad or am I just kidding myself?

Hating what I used to love,"I don't know if this is the right place to post about this, but I thought I would give it a shot.

I've been an artist my whole life, ever since I can remember. I went through many years of art school, and while studying I was doing well. Art has been synonymous with my identity forever, and I've always wanted to be an artist more than anything else.

But I've also had mental health issues my entire life, and I've gone through a couple of periods of terrible depression in the past. I've been medicated since I was a child, so that's helped most of the time. But now, starting last autumn, I've gone into a depressive period that's a bit different than the previous ones. 

I think a combination of my medication losing efficacy and experiencing an artistic burnout are the reasons for this depression. I did two solo shows recently and have been pushing myself to draw so much, so I think burnout is very likely. In any case, I started to notice that I didn't enjoy drawing anymore.

Drawing became a terrible, dreaded chore. It started to feel like way too much work - and that work was not interesting or exciting. The work was also difficult and just SO much. SO many lines. Honestly, when I think about drawing I start to feel physically unwell. 

I've been advised to take a break from drawing, and I'm doing so. I haven't actually drawn anything for about a couple of weeks, and I'm going for one month. 

I'm just so terrified that I'll never enjoy drawing again. I can't even remember what it feels like to not hate drawing. But I still want to be an artist so much. Plus, I honestly don't have any other hobbies unrelated to art that I could focus on. Nothing else really interests me.

I should also mention that I'm switching medications right now, and I'm about to go onto a full dose of my new medication (which is actually one that's worked for me in the past).  

I've never experienced anything like this, and I'm so scared. Any thoughts or advice would be super appreciated.",lindanimated,0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/feca1a/hating_what_i_used_to_love/,know right place post thought would give shot artist whole life ever since remember went many year art school studying wa well art ha synonymous identity forever always wanted artist anything else also mental health issue entire life gone couple period terrible depression past medicated since wa child helped time starting last autumn gone depressive period bit different previous one think combination medication losing efficacy experiencing artistic burnout reason depression two solo show recently pushing draw much think burnout likely case started notice enjoy drawing anymore drawing became terrible dreaded chore started feel like way much work work wa interesting exciting work wa also difficult much many line honestly think drawing start feel physically unwell advised take break drawing actually drawn anything couple week going one month terrified never enjoy drawing even remember feel like hate drawing still want artist much plus honestly hobby unrelated art could focus nothing else really interest also mention switching medication right go onto full dose new medication actually one worked past never experienced anything like scared thought advice would super appreciated,hating used love,lind animated

Questions regarding therapy,"So I just talked to my parents today for the first time regarding that I want to get therapy. I just have a few questions (they may be hard to answer, so bare with me, I just want to know what to expect): 

1) idk if this makes sense, but some of my typical depressive thoughts seem to not be as accessible when i'm in a better (not happy though) mood. this makes it harder to talk about the underlying issues. could this be a potential problem?

2) what do they typically ask you on the first appointment?

3) if i've been really narrow-minded and close-minded to a lot of people around me trying to tell me to think more positive and eat more, etc., is therapy really best for me? would therapy be helping me become less stubborn and more open-minded?

4) for those who have gone through therapy, was it relieving to finally have the official diagnosis?

5) again, for those who have gone through/are going through therapy, what's the biggest change you've seen in yourself? it can be good or bad.

finally decided to clean (and thank you to all of you),i’ve been going thru a pretty big rough patch i’ve the last month and so the small amount of time i’ve spent at home has been devoted to either drinking smoking or sleeping so it’s become an absolute disaster. so i decided to take the next two days and devote them to cleaning up my apartment. i can’t remember who commented it but i remember seeing someone saying that even just doing one load of laundry or making their bed helps them a lot. i don’t post much in this sub but i sure do lurk a lot and i just wanted to thank everyone that comments and reply’s to stuff. i just want to let you know that you’re not only helping the person who’s post you’re commenting on. you can be helping countless other people like me who just sit back and read and i want to thank this whole community. i don’t know if cleanings gonna help me in the long run and i know it won’t fix all my problems but it’s a start. and idk if whoever’s reading this needs to hear it but the small things matter. even if it’s picking up all your dirty clothes and putting them into the hamper. the smallest things can make a huge difference. if you’re reading this i love you thank you for making this community what it is. we’re gonna all get thru this one step at a time. keep your heads up.,somyfriendscantsee,1,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/feawi2/finally_decided_to_clean_and_thank_you_to_all_of/,going thru pretty big rough patch last month small amount time spent home ha devoted either drinking smoking sleeping become absolute disaster decided take next two day devote cleaning apartment remember commented remember seeing someone saying even one load laundry making bed help lot post much sub sure lurk lot wanted thank everyone comment reply stuff want let know helping person post commenting helping countless people like sit back read want thank whole community know cleaning gonna help long run know fix problem start idk whoever reading need hear small thing matter even picking dirty clothes putting hamper smallest thing make huge difference reading love thank making community gonna get thru one step time keep head,finally decided clean thank,friend cant see

On my mind,"So after ages I finally asked my Crush (and one of my best friends) out on a date. And she said yes.This made me the fking happiest i've bin in forever. After 2 months of dating I realized that we were taking it very slowly. I thought it was fine, good things need their time to blossom.   
After another 2 months I realized that i was suffering under these circumstances and that it was really hard for me not knowing if she still liked me back. Yes we kissed and yes she initiated it once but two weeks ago this happened:

After one of the best nights i ever had, we were talking in the car and I just asked if everything was alright with ""us"". After a moment of silence I dreaded her answer and then she startet trying to say something. She tried and tried again and again until she finally said: "" I am in love with someone else... And the thing is it's not another male.""This has been really hard on me. I don't think she's a Lesbian but i, felt how insecure she was about her own sexuallity and that she was sooo afraid that people would not accept her anymore. Now i am stuck in a wierd af situation. I still really love her and I feel like giving up on ""us"" isn't even an option. She has been one of my best friend in ages and I dont want to loose her. But i dont know if its healthy for me if we keep on seeing each other or hanging out. I mean i've been kinda depressed for a while now, the bad feelings and thought come and go.

I'm also worried that if I distance myself from her that it would intensify her insecurites.

If she were in love with another guy i'd probalby stop seeing her tho, wouldn't I? Or at least I should, shouldn't I?

I told her that we have to talk and we are going to meet on Sunday. I just dont know what i want to tell her. That I love her? That we are done? That we are cool and that she should sort her stuff out?That she's a bitch for dating me for months with no intention of being in a relationship? I have pretty bad moodswings and don't know what I really feel.  
I just know that things can't stay the same as they are now.

My Depression,"  

The thoughts of a 30-year-old depressed guy. I am afraid of, well not afraid but the things I think about on a regular basis. I worry if my daughter will be taken away from because of my crazy ex-wife. I worry about what my daughter thinks or will think of me because I have no goals or ambitions right now other than to make enough money to outshine my ex-wife. I want to do all these things, but I am too worried about everything that will go wrong with them. I want to start a business and be successful, but I am afraid of failure and getting stuck right back where I am, which is like resetting my whole life. I worry about if I am going to get cancer because I am addicted to chewing tobacco and want to stop for my daughters sake because I don’t want it to influence her life because I have been told it is bad for you. I worry about being alone the rest of my life because I can’t seem to find anyone who loves me or is it because I am to shallow and don’t think anyone over 150 lbs. is pretty. I can’t sleep because my mind races and races at night and these things flow through my mind. I worry about looking successful to the people around me which holds me back because I don’t want to show how unsuccessful I am right now. I feel like a failure and a worthless person. the only thing that gets me through the really really tough thoughts is my daughter. And if I wasn’t here who would raise her. The pressure around me to do the right thing is tremendous but what is the right thing? Is the right thing what everyone thinks or what is socially acceptable? Is the right thing what I think is right? but then why do other people think some of the things I do are wrong? What makes them right? I think about the things in my past that I could have done differently but what’s the point? I can’t change them so why do I dwell on them? Do I need to even worry about them? I worry about how I am going to pay for things if I lose my VA disability but I don’t want to go to my VA appointments because I feel it reinforces the fact that I am messed up and I come up with excuses as to why I shouldn’t go. to try to reason with myself as to why its ok not to go. It’s also a distance away which wastes 2 hours of my days sitting at home doing nothing. So is it helpful to go to an appointment and lie to a doc for 15 mins telling him that every things ok and I take meds, Which I don’t take my meds because 1 I hate taking medication every day and 2 I don’t like to think taking them helps but they do because if I took them then I might not be writing this. I know I need to do better but I work at a dead-end job that has no future for me. I am just a pawn in someone else’s business story. I want to make more money, but I don’t know where to go because no one is telling me where to go and I am afraid to start anything just to fail. I don’t want to waste my time doing something and have that time taken from me by an unforeseen event. But why do I worry about an unforeseen event when I can’t even see it coming. Is my life that messed up that I am worried about something that may or may not happen. I sit here typing this looking into my baby monitor telling myself I need to do better for my daughter. What example am I setting for her if I don’t do anything with my life. I thought I had my whole life planned out then boom my world is rocked by an unhealthy relationship which everyone but me saw. Everyone told me I shouldn’t have been with that girl. Everyone told me I needed to leave her. But as cliché (why did I just look up how to spell cliché in something I am only going to read) as it sounds, I loved her. Or at least what I thought was love. I was ready to spend my life with her, but she went and fucked two other people and who knows how many others. But blamed me because she thought I had an affair…. Which I didn’t have an affair. I write this hoping my feelings will leave my body and I will not worry about them anymore. But for how long is it going to last? Is this really going to help? Maybe I’ll post this on some reddit website and become famous for it. Ha who am I kidding. I am nobody. I am a middle age man who has been handed a fucked-up life and can’t get out. But it’s not as fucked up as some people’s lives so why does mine hurt so bad? Maybe I am stuck on the materialistic things and want to hide behind them. Like having a nice truck but not as nice as the one I want because I am smart enough not to burry myself in debt and have that looming over me. I am content on doing nothing but am afraid of everything. I tell myself I am meant for more, but I don’t know how to get there. I am smart but not smart enough to figure out how to make myself happy. So, am I really that smart? I can tell you all night and day that I am smarter than what I am doing right now but have nothing to show for it. I think everyone is out to get me in some way shape or form, I don’t trust anyone, I think they all have some agenda to serve themselves but don’t we all. Is anyone truly selfless? Now I am just rambling to ramble so focus, focus on why I am writing this. Focus focus focus why why am I handed a dealt of cards that has no instructions? is that life? What’s the purpose? Why do I even waste my time? Why can’t I win the lottery and hide behind the money at least I will be able to do the things that make me happy because I won’t be constrained by money? But if I did have it would I really be HAPPY? I think it would be better than where I am. But why would I be so lucky as to win the lottery when there are stronger people out there who deserve it more than me? is luck a figment of our imaginations? are all the strings being pulled by some divine or supreme power? Some might say I am on drugs right now to think like this. I’m not. This is how my mind works and I think it’s a blessing and a curse. Who will even read this? Now it’s just becoming to long for the quick reader to think it’s interesting and too short for anyone to take it seriously but I’m not writing it for them I am writing it for myself. I want to get better I want to do better. But where are the answers? Do I make up the answers and hope I get by? Do I tell lies and belittle other people to get through life? Why not? It feels like other people, all people do it to me. Who is coming to punish those who do me wrong? Do I do it? No, why? because I am afraid of the consequences. I am pressured by everyone to do the right thing. Maybe that’s what governs people? Then why doesn’t everyone act the same? Are there to many questions in this? Who cares? Its mine right, maybe I will share this so someone can laugh, someone can feel empowered to do the same? Someone can belittle me? I need to do better I need to push myself to do better. I started working out because I thought I might get laid if I look better. But is anyone even going to notice? I wasn’t in shape before and got laid, sort of… I more or less have always found the girl who is in need and made her feel better, then when that wears off, I am alone… am I going to be alone for the rest of my life? At least I have my daughter, right? But eventually she will leave me too because no one wants to be around someone as depressed as me… I wouldn’t want to be around me. I always hear this saying on the radio or tv or what have you “ you have to love yourself before anyone can love you”… who am I kidding I will always be alone because I don’t see myself loving myself. I am fat, ugly and stupid. I don’t have any value. I don’t have the ability to love anyone else because I just want to use the other person to make myself feel better. But how is that? Does that even make sense? Am I connecting with anyone? If this is circulating around and you are reading this far, then possibly? Should I keep going? Maybe I still feel like going. My fingers are starting to hurt but it feels a little better to not have all these things bottled up inside me. Maybe it’s because I am pretending to type it to an imaginary audience. so, things I worry about. I worry about paying bills, but I am good at financial stuff. So that’s ok but I still worry about them. I worry that I am not doing the right thing. I worry about what other people think of me but that’s ridiculous. I should not worry about that right? I worry about the spelling in this, but I have spell check. I worry about sleeping all day when I have my daughter because she could hurt herself because she is 2. I also worry she is going to grow up and think I just slept all the time, but she doesn’t know I was up until 3am writing a stupid paper about the things I worry about. But that’s not her fault. I worry about making a good impression on the people around me because I don’t want to be alone and the only people around me is family right now. I seem to piss everyone else off. Why do I piss them off? Because I am pushing people away so they can’t hurt me. Is that an excuse? I worry about getting into an accident and not being able to take care of my responsibilities, but should I? I worry about being someone else’s burden, I don’t want to hinder someone else’s life with my inability to love myself. It is no one’s problem but my own. But there are people who want to help me or are they getting paid to do so because someone decided it was good for business to make money on others suffering. #cancer maybe that’s too much. I definitely can’t post this anywhere now. I worry about getting up in the morning and it being my last day. I worry that all of this will pile up and I’ll do something I can’t take back. But that’s why I think of my daughter, I worry I’ll be trapped in this life and these circumstances for a long time because I am too afraid to take a leap of faith and just try to make my life better. I worry about anything and everything. I don’t care about anyone other than my daughter truly, her life is the only real thing I care about. She is so innocent, am I contaminating her life by being in it though? Is my negative thinking rubbing off on her and will she be like me? I hope not. I see the negative in everything. I can’t think fast but when I do think at my own pace, I can figure shit out. I worry about being in a situation I can’t think my way out of. I truly worry about everything. My daughter is being pushed into school. Well I think so. Her mother doesn’t want her to not be in school, because she is ready. I think it’s because her mom doesn’t want to take care of her and wants to push her into school so someone else must deal with her. She seems too young to start preschool in my mind. Why do I care so much about what my ex-wife is doing or thinks? Maybe it is because I have to deal with her for the rest of my life, not like she is going away and I can’t not talk to her because then the court will see me as being unfit to parent then I will lose my daughter. I don’t want that now do I. I feel like my ex-wife has her life together and mine is falling apart underneath me but maybe she is just hiding it like I am trying to do? But I’m the one writing this so we will stick with my feelings. I don’t want to lose my daughter but everything I do I am feeling like it is a movement on a chess board and at any moment I am going to get check mated. Who even uses a term like that anymore? Apparently, I do. I worry about who is going to care for my daughter when I am not around. I worry she will fall into something and I can’t save her. Literally and figuratively. I worry my life is pointless then I think of her smile and watch videos of her, and it makes me happy. I worry I am a burden on people, and no one wants to deal with me, so I try to hide myself. I feel I am not good at anything. Or not good enough. I feel lonesome tired afraid and beaten down. I have to many struggles. too much on my mind. Emotionless. Defeated.

I isolate myself when I crave interaction.,"I feel pretty down every month or so, very down. I usually feel self hate and loneliness. I desperately crave feeling loved and cared about, and I have the urge to talk to people I'm close to, but all I end up doing is isolating myself, depriving myself of what I want, and then feel worse. It pushes people away.

Does anyone else isolate themselves and bottle up what they are feeling? Anyone know why I do it?

How to help a loved one to talk about how they're feeling?,"I have someone who is depressed and well she cannot talk easily to me about it. She used to but now it's harder for her. I tell her it's okay to talk to me about it, it won't change anything between us but she says no. That she'll hurt me by telling me what she feels. I tell her that it's okay to hurt me I can handle it. 
I don't really know what to do about it and why does she find it hard to talk to me. I do my best not to hurt her in any way.
She thinks that she'll lose me if she said anything.

"I’m a pos, and you’re a pos too.","Perhaps I’m just playing the victim, but life has been pretty shitty lately and I’m spinning circles in my head. Am I the problem? Are all of the situations I find myself in, woven by me? Am I the diabolical monster weaving this fucking hell I’m stuck in? I’m so fucking tired of my brain coming to the conclusion that I am the victim. I’m tired. Some how it’s your fault that I’m codependent. It’s your fault that my choice in men has always been the worst. I mean, it has to be your fault that I married at 19, to the only person stupid enough to say yes. It has to be your fault that I’m four years into a relationship I feel has no escape. I’m drowning and I have the weight of an entire second person tugging at my feet. I fucking blinked and here I am. Years older but my brain feels like it hasn’t evolved in the slightest. Still easily disturbed and hurt. Still putting all my trust into one person just to be let down. Just to come to the harsh realization that they are human too, they make mistakes too. I know, I know… Everyone fucks up, but why does it feel like the world is ending when the people that mean the most to me fall short of my unrealistic expectations? Why do I feel ridiculously deceived? Surely I am their whole entire life, surely their world revolves around me. Why do I get stuck with these insecure, unsure thoughts rolling and crashing in my head. Surely it’s your fault, of course. I mean you were supposed to be the only man that never left. You were supposed to be the one that held me when I was let down. You were supposed to show me that I deserve more than what my taste lusts for. I’m sorry you never had that either. I’m sorry no one ever showed you right from wrong and I’m sorry no one held you when your heart was broken.

I’m so exhausted and scared,"Hey guys. Last week, i went through the roughest day that ocd has ever thrown at me, which pushed me to finally tell my mom that I was going through severe anxiety (OCD) and I didn’t know what to do anymore.

I can’t walk down the street without worrying about whether or not I knocked someone over without realizing it, or bumped someone into the road without realizing it, or worrying about a rabid animal biting me without realizing it and dying from rabies, or worrying about stepping on a needle infected with HIV, or worrying about a homeless person infecting me with HIV/something worse without me realizing it.

I can’t drive without worrying about whether I hit a pedestrian without realizing it on that right turn, or that left turn, or if that green light was really green or did I just run a red light and run over a pedestrian crossing without realizing it?

I can’t get near moving water without worrying about the brain eating amoeba. If I get splashed in the face, Ill freak out internally for the rest of the day. I can’t eat food without worrying about it being poisoned or worrying about tapeworms.

I can’t have a basic conversation without worrying about whether something I say will come back to haunt me

I KNOW these things are stupid and will probably never happen, but my brain keeps on throwing me the “what if?” and I won’t be able to move on. I’ll even get physically affected by my anxiety- my eyes will burn and it will get harder to breathe

Anyway, my mom set up an appointment for a psychiatrist (I’m 18 and I’m still not smart enough/have enough money to set one up myself, I feel worthless already, pls don’t remind me) and I went there today.

The guy seemed like a good guy and everything, and made me sign paperwork as I was talking to him and everything, and everything was cool. On the way out, my mom asked the guy how much the bill would be, and he said it would be around 300 dollars for the first visit and around 150 for every visit after that.

I’ve been so upset ever since. I feel so bad. I told my mom I didn’t feel good going to a psychiatrist if it would be that expensive, but she’s super super supportive and insists on me getting help (she goes through anxiety too, to a lesser extent).

Then, my brain got the idea that what if the papers the guy made me sign was really a contract that would come back to haunt me later (ex-what if I signed away part of my future income,etc.) it sounds so stupid and it is. My brain just sees everything as a threat and is stuck in a perpetual fight or flight mode

Anyway, I don’t know what to do. I feel Iike for the past eight months I’ve just been a drain on my parents and everyone around me. All I am is a burden that can’t even make myself happy. I feel like if I don’t go to anymore appointments with this psychiatrist, I’ll have thrown away 300 bucks of my mom’s money for no reason, but if I do go to another appointment with him, I’ll cost her 150 a pop. I feel like I’m taking advantage of people and I feel like I’m too stupid to get my act together. I just want to be able to be happy again and have peace of mind. I’ve watched myself literally go nuts and I don’t know what to do anymore. To add to it, this is all in my head. I can’t even tell reality from obsession anymore. This whole battle that I’ve fought for the last eight months is all in my head. I’m not doing anything productive by fighting OCD. I’m just wasting my time and I feel like ocd is just my excuse for being worthless.

I'm unemployed and I have no motivation to find a job,"I'm a 23 year old unemployed woman still living with my mom. I quit my job 3 months ago because of the stress and anxiety it was putting me through. Of late my mental health has worsened a lot and I can't seem to get out of the loop. Everything makes me cry and I don't even feel like going out of my room most days. I go to a psychiatrist and I am on meds but nothing seems to be working. (Ive changed almost 7 therapists/psychiatrists now because my mental health was showing no improvement.) I feel like a parasite, latching on to my mother and aunts for financial support. I want to move out and live independently but I don't even feel anything. I don't feel like doing anything, let alone wanting to work. I constantly worry whether I'm just being lazy and making excuses or whether I genuinely have a problem. I don't want to face people, give interviews or work among other people. Everytime I get a job I end up having panic attacks and excessively stressing out. The thought of having responsibility and knowing that there are certain expectations I have to meet while working, and the constant anxiety of doing badly at my job trouble me so much. I don't want to go through any of this. I don't want to. I don't want to do anything. I'm tired of being taunted by everyone and having to dodge questions about why I'm still unemployed.

The world is a big disappointment?,"Is it just me or does the world seem to be fucked ever since 2012. I wish the world ended in 2012 so I wouldn't have to deal with all the bullshit that I have been through. 

I'm currently in debt by like $25000, I work a full time job that is dependent on weather and the sea. My job pays well through winter but once summer hits I get paid fuck all. When I fall fully into a depressive/dilussional state of mind. My brain races at 100 miles an hour at all times, every little thing I over analyse. I have seen my only friend go through drug addiction and drug related psychosis. I have seen how life can shit all over you. 

My depression started at an early age because of bullying and lack of friends. Except the one in my life currently, you can't destroy our relationship. I feel like my depression really kicked in when I was around 15 or 16. My friend moved away to another city and I was left all alone. At the time bullying got worse and I made a few acquaintances but no real close friends. When I was 17 I dropped out of school and moved out of my family home. I started to have panic attacks in the shower and that was when I turned to drugs to numb the pain. Xanax was my go to for sedation as I could fight the effects somehow I loved that. Iv been a daily cannabis smoker for most of the time since I was 16 except the times I ran out and couldn't get anymore. I have done lots of psychedelics (u could call me a psychonaut) any sort of alternate reality really. Cannabis helps motivate me to stuff. 

I'm currently 19, still a virgin and struggling with financial situations. I  only just earn enough money every week to cover my bills so I never really buy anything for myself except weed. I can never seem to get ahead of my depression. It's like it just keeps dragging me down. When I'm really depressed I choose to sleep most of the day as sleeping is the only place where I can shut the fuck up. (I have lucid dreams all the time).

Venting....,"I don’t know where else to go.... I don’t know where else to vent. I’m scared of judgment. I feel like I’m just lonely and attention seeking. I feel like a waste of space.

Coming to terms with the temporariness of it all.,"My mood fluctuations have not changed over the past year at all, despite me starting medication. However what I have noticed is that I'm able to contextualise thoughts and feelings a lot easier these days. For example I'm feeling fairly rubbish at the moment, but instead of the thoughts of loneliness and inadequacy I used to get with these feelings, I now just look forward to not feeling like this. It comes in waves and always has done, but I'm feeling it is affecting my productivity a lot less than it used to, obviously I'm more productive when I'm not feeling like this, but by Monday I probably won't feel like this.

I used to have thoughts of ending it, still do sometimes but I'm glad I didn't. I'm much happier now that I know it's not constant.

We take our victories when we can.,"This is my own personal experiences not a how too or trying in any way to say my life is worse or the way I cope will help anyone else.

It has been a long journey, a fight every day, sometimes we win sometimes we loose.

Looking back 22 years ago, I was never formerly diagnosed with ADHD or Bipolar type 2 effective disorder, was never diagnosed officially as on the higher function autistic spectrum that all came much later.

The umbrella term seemed to be Reactive Depression relating to not only my Fathers death when I was 12 but my Girlfriend/Wife being diagnosed with incurable cancer at 21.

I spent the following 20 years fighting along side my Wife against this horrible illness that slowly destroyed her body until 20th November 2018 a double cardiac arrest with me standing next to her telling the doctors to stop because I knew she wasn't coming back. (her heart was a 14% functionality due to a silent heart attack 13 days beforehand caused by damage done via medication to keep the cancer away which also caused diabetes and kidney failure).

7 days after she died I was diagnosed with Bowel Cancer and spent that Christmas in hospital having 40% of my bowels removed (I have nodules on my lungs they are keeping an eye on).

Being in the same hospital as Paola died 6 weeks beforehand plus certain pain medication caused hallucinations and the beginning of my diagnosis of PTSD.

No family because my mum by this time was in a care home in late stages of early onset dementia.

It felt like the universe was just hitting me with punch after punch just to see how many times I could stand back up.

6 months on no one visiting so outside contact, I was on suicide watch and Samaritans help line actually called me weekly to see if I was still around, I had a plan to end my life, my logic boiling down to the following two points.

If I end my life and that is the end then I am in no more pain.

If I end my life and there is something after I am with Paola.

Had a plan, even down to writing a script that would send out emails to my Doctor and Psychologist so professionals found my body not my neighbors, my dogs had a forever home setup and I was visiting all the forums and communities saying goodbye to all the games me and Wife had played.

I was in a very dark place and the only light was an oncoming train which was either ""cancer comes back"" or ""A life without my best friend)

Everything was black and grey, nothing felt real to me and even when they told me 73% chance my bowel cancer wasn't coming back I couldn't smile and be happy.

**What changed ?**

One of the last places that I was going to visit was the game The Division, it had many good memories of us both exploring, shooting out windows, messing around, I did a walk through saying goodbye to my wife, and as I logged off an advertisement for The Division 2 came up and I thought to myself, ""lets see what mess they have made"" ""No reason to keep my money if I am going to end things"" So I bought the most expensive pack, downloaded it and logged on.

Something amazing happened, the next morning I wanted to log back on, I hadn't gamed since Paola had died, I hadn't interacted, talked or blown anything up.

A few days later I wrote a reddit post on that forum thanking the developers for saving my life.

The response was amazing and people started saying why don't you go on youtube, on twitch, why don't you talk about your experiences, mental health, cancer, diabetes, dialysis, heart disease, why don't you tell the world about how gaming helped you.

My response was ""what have I got to loose"", I watched my wife die, could anything anyone said about me making a fool of myself online ever come close to this.

I bought a mic, I bought a webcam, I did cooking videos, vlogs, streaming and those victories really helped me go from day to day.

I never missed a day at least 1 video every single day went up on youtube and twitch.

I have close to 500 followers on Youtube, close to 1000 on Twitch, others follow me on Facebook, Reddit and Mixer, I now multi stream to all 4 main places.

Am I still broken yes, I am classed as severely disabled, some days It takes me coming down stairs 3 times for me remembering to brush my teeth or do laundry.

I spend a lot of time in VR Beat Saber, SkyrimVr and others, Valve sent me a Valve index with no strings attached, after reading one of my posts (both me and Paola were involved in VR since 2016 due to her disabilities it was wonderful).

VR is an amazing tool for fighting depression, the complete immersion of being within a game be it a horror, a rhythm game (I have no rhythm), or fantasy, can help switch your mind to a world where life makes more sense.

My Senior Psychologist and 2 of my specialists have signed off on me all feeling that Gaming, VR and my Vlogging actually have given me a level of existence and a place to be.

I Don’t Care About Living Anymore,"Over the past few months, my depression and social anxiety have spiraled out of control. At the end of my junior year of high school I had a really bad breakup and lost all my friends causing me to start self harming and isolating myself from everyone. Thankfully, this acquaintance I had took time out of his day to make music with me at lunch. It really meant a lot to me. He was the only friend I really had at the time. I had hung out with his friends a couple times before throughout high school, so I started playing video games with some of them. Eventually during the summer I got really close to them, and I became a part of their friend group. They really brought me out of that dark hole of depression, and I had never loved a group of friends more in my entire life. I had and still am going through extreme social anxiety, but helped me become more confident in myself and alleviated that a bunch. In the beginning of senior year I hung out with them after-school basically everyday, and it was the happiest I’d ever been. 

I don’t want to get into details but then something changed. A bunch of the group dynamics changed that made me felt inferior. I thought they thought I wasn’t as funny anymore, and was more weird and awkward. I reverted back to the state I was in with my previous girlfriend, and I started to worry incessantly that I would be abandoned by them. My mindset about the group also changed. I felt like I had to constantly meet their standards and entertain them or else they would abandon me. This has made socializing with them more of a grueling chore than a fun experience. I’ve isolated myself from them a lot, and I even feel a bit of anger towards them. 

There are these events that happen that make me feel like they think I’m weird, awkward, unfunny, and annoying, so I constantly try to change myself. I try to be less talkative, and apply a tight filter to what I say. I hate who I am. I can’t live with myself. I feel like everyone I interact with thinks I’m all of those things, and I can’t stand it. I hate everything about myself. My voice, the way I pronounce things, my mannerisms, my sense of humor, my conversations with people, everything. I can’t take it anymore.

Right now I’m on 50 mg Zoloft. Tonight I’m going to trip on 300 mg robotussin gels. There’s a possibility I could experience extreme even fatal side effects due to serotonin syndrome, but I don’t care anymore. I just want to be taken out of this reality for a while. It’s not even that I’m suicidal. I’m not trying to kill myself. But if that’s what ends up happening, I don’t care. I just don’t want to be here.",veelively,1,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/feddpq/i_dont_care_about_living_anymore/,past month depression social anxiety spiraled control end junior year high school really bad breakup lost friend causing start self harming isolating everyone thankfully acquaintance took time day make music lunch really meant lot wa friend really time hung friend couple time throughout high school started playing video game eventually summer got really close became part friend group really brought dark hole depression never loved group friend entire life still going extreme social anxiety helped become confident alleviated bunch beginning senior year hung school basically everyday wa happiest ever want get detail something changed bunch group dynamic changed made felt inferior thought thought funny anymore wa weird awkward reverted back state wa previous girlfriend started worry incessantly would abandoned mindset group also changed felt like constantly meet standard entertain else would abandon ha made socializing grueling chore fun experience isolated lot even feel bit anger towards event happen make feel like think weird awkward unfunny annoying constantly try change try le talkative apply tight filter say hate live feel like everyone interact think thing stand hate everything voice way pronounce thing mannerism sense humor conversation people everything take anymore right 50 mg zoloft tonight going trip 300 mg robotussin gel possibility could experience extreme even fatal side effect due serotonin syndrome care anymore want taken reality even suicidal trying kill end happening care want,care living anymore,vee lively
"My parents don't take my suicidal thoughts seriously, and my friends act like I'm invisible. I don't know what to do anymore.","Hi, I'm an eighth grader at a magnet school. I have ADD (attention deficit disorder), symptoms of depression, and I'm suicidal. For the past 3 years I've slowly been less and less motivated to do anything, even what I enjoy. I just want to go to sleep forever and forget about all the stress of school and a difficult social life. I get very stressed over school as the stakes go up, and my mom is constantly reminding me that I'll be a failure if I get too many B's. It doesn't help that my friends began ignoring me more and more when we started middle school with new, better people to hang out with than me. I'm treated like a tag-along now. My former best friends only talk to me and listen when they're bored and nobody else is there to talk to. I started having thoughts of suicide near the end of seventh grade, but it's really gotten worse this year as more is expected of me and my friends cast me further away. 
I decided to finally talk to someone this year, since my previous hints of needing help went unnoticed by my mom. On a day where I felt very low mentally, I told my mom I was suicidal. I broke down crying, and she hugged me. However, she said, ""Don't EVER even think about killing yourself. Do you know what that would do to me?"" I was a little upset about her reaction, as she seemed more concerned about herself. But I kept telling her more. I told her about how I thought I had depression, and she dismissed it as ""stress"" and said it would stop if i started to be positive. I was taken aback by this. I love my mother a lot, but she's never been good at giving advice or helping with my mental health. I got mad at her and began yelling about her never understanding or helping with my feelings. I was a little too extreme, but the anger was not irrational. She yelled back something about her trying to help with the grief counselor (1. She didn't help very much. 2. She was there to help us deal with grief over a family death, and she didn't help with my suicidalness). What made me feel worthless was when she yelled, ""What do you want me to do about it?"" and told her I wanted her there for me to talk to and she went on about my grades, what have I told you, learn to deal with your emotions better,  etc. I ran off crying to continue my homework. A few minutes later she came in with her phone and my dad was on a call. She had told him. She was mad about me not focusing on my homework and I needed to hurry it up and finish and stop crying. I kept crying, upset she didn't help, and a few minutes later my dad arrives. He was upset that I wasn't working on the project and ""wasting time"". I kept crying until he started yelling to stop crying. I stopped, tears welling in my eyes. I love my dad too, but he can't control his anger very well, and he follows his parent's ways of discipline, which is what he grew up with. As he lectured me I started clawing my arm to calm myself like I always do. He noticed me leaving scars on my arm and got angrier. He told me to stop and said this: ""Do you want me to do it for you?"" This really upset me, but I said nothing to avoid an argument. He got me to finish the project. He said he cared about me and loved me, and he left. No discussion of my mental state. My mom called him when i started crying later and he wasn't mad this time. He told me to go to sleep and feel better. I didn't feel better when I slept.
I just needed to get all that out.... I've been considering suicide a lot, and I know there's ""help everywhere"" like hotlines and such, but it won't help. I need people I care about to talk to. I lost my grandma in December of 2018 to cancer. She listened and cared. I have no one I know of now. My friends don't listen, and I feel like they think I talk about sad stuff too much. I just need to know what to do, because I honestly don't know anymore. The people I care about most can't help me, and I feel worthless. I never know what to talk about, and when i get to talk for once, my friends look at me different than they do at other friends. They look lost, bored, and like they want me to hurry up and get it over with. Then they go back to talking to the other people. I just need some advice... if you read this whole vent then you are an amazing person and I hope you have a wonderful day.",LynxxArt,0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/fe9zs9/my_parents_dont_take_my_suicidal_thoughts/,hi eighth grader magnet school add attention deficit disorder symptom depression suicidal past 3 year slowly le le motivated anything even enjoy want go sleep forever forget stress school difficult social life get stressed school stake go mom constantly reminding failure get many b help friend began ignoring started middle school new better people hang treated like tag along former best friend talk listen bored nobody else talk started thought suicide near end seventh grade really gotten worse year expected friend cast away decided finally talk someone year since previous hint needing help went unnoticed mom day felt low mentally told mom wa suicidal broke cry hugged however said ever even think killing know would wa little upset reaction seemed concerned kept telling told thought depression dismissed stress said would stop started positive wa taken aback love mother lot never good giving advice helping mental health got mad began yelling never understanding helping feeling wa little extreme anger wa irrational yelled back something trying help grief counselor 1 help much 2 wa help u deal grief family death help suicidalness made feel worthless wa yelled want told wanted talk went grade told learn deal emotion better etc ran cry continue homework minute later came phone dad wa call told wa mad focusing homework needed hurry finish stop cry kept cry upset help minute later dad arrives wa upset working project wasting time kept cry started yelling stop cry stopped tear welling eye love dad control anger well follows parent way discipline grew lectured started clawing arm calm like always noticed leaving scar arm got angrier told stop said want really upset said nothing avoid argument got finish project said cared loved left discussion mental state mom called started cry later mad time told go sleep feel better feel better slept needed get considering suicide lot know help everywhere like hotlines help need people care talk lost grandma december 2018 cancer listened cared one know friend listen feel like think talk sad stuff much need know honestly know anymore people care help feel worthless never know talk get talk friend look different friend look lost bored like want hurry get go back talking people need advice read whole vent amazing person hope wonderful day,parent take suicidal thought seriously friend act like invisible know anymore,lynx x art
Drinking keeps me alive,It used to be something I did once every couple weeks at a party when I was a teen. Now it makes me happy. I love waking up still hungover with brain fog. It gives me this fuzzy feeling I used to feel with my SO. I know it’s terrible for me. I still work out but that only gives me an hour high. I’ve realized if I’m sober my thoughts consume me and when I’m drunk everything’s ok.

Thinking about suicide more and more,"I am in a very dark place right now. I'm 32. I've been unemployed since last October after getting laid off (not due to performance, my whole team and 15% of my company got let go) and do not have a firm idea of what to do with my life. I have started to interview again over the past few weeks but they are mostly for the same type of work (which is pretty niche, not a ton of jobs available) and I just don't know if this is what I want to be doing for the rest of my life. In the meantime, I have been getting dicked around by recruiters and just feel like I'm getting left out to pasture even though I feel like I have a good background and interview well.  


Simultaneously, I am finishing up a part-time MBA program which I feel like has been a colossal waste of time, money, and energy. I honestly feel like I had better luck getting responses to job applications BEFORE starting my program. I have been slogging through my final semester, struggling to find the motivation to do my work. I finish in about 2 months, at which time I may or may not be employed again. I just don't know. It's extremely stressful. I will need to begin paying my college loans within 6 months of graduating and don't know how I am ever going to save for a down payment. I immensely regret going to business school.  


Add to this the fact that, for whatever reason, I seem to be getting ignored by just about every therapist I've reached out to for counseling. Maybe I need to start leaving messages that I'm thinking about ending it. I feel like I am losing my mind, and the only thing that keeps me feeling sane is my girlfriend, who without I'm not sure what I'd do. Unfortunately, she doesn't know about my compulsive  masturbation/porn addiction which seems to be consuming my life at the moment. I'm a \*\*\*\*ing mess and I don't know what to do.   


It's hard for me to think about actually killing myself, but I find myself thinking about it often. It gives me some sort of dark solace knowing that I could end it, donate everything I have (which isn't much) to some charity, and be remembered as more than a living nobody, which I feel like I am today.",spatula24,1,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/fe4hte/thinking_about_suicide_more_and_more/,dark place right 32 unemployed since last october getting laid due performance whole team 15 company got let go firm idea life started interview past week mostly type work pretty niche ton job available know want rest life meantime getting dicked around recruiter feel like getting left pasture even though feel like good background interview well simultaneously finishing part time mba program feel like ha colossal waste time money energy honestly feel like better luck getting response job application starting program slogging final semester struggling find motivation work finish 2 month time may may employed know extremely stressful need begin paying college loan within 6 month graduating know ever going save payment immensely regret going business school add fact whatever reason seem getting ignored every therapist reached counseling maybe need start leaving message thinking ending feel like losing mind thing keep feeling sane girlfriend without sure unfortunately know compulsive masturbation porn addiction seems consuming life moment ing mess know hard think actually killing find thinking often give sort dark solace knowing could end donate everything much charity remembered living nobody feel like today,thinking suicide,spatula 24
I needed a mother,"You always hear how women fear they won’t love their child if it’s adopted which in most cases isn’t true. But in our case it seems to be true. Thank you for all the nice Christmas gifts you gave me. But you never gave the sense you cared about me. You were never there for me. I’m always getting blamed for things and It always feels like you just shrug me off. I never felt comfortable coming to you for advice and you never asked. Why is the connection between us nonexistent? You taught me about my period, you gave me a book that explained puberty. You never taught me about sex. You never ask if I have a boyfriend. You never ask me anything. You don’t really know me at all. I try to talk to you and you seem annoyed when I do. I come to you for guidance about what I should major in and you just judge me for not being able to make up my mind. You’re always petty when I give you attitude but you don’t ask why. I’ve been depressed since I was 12 years old and you never noticed. You never helped me with school and hated that I wanted my license and I’m trying to get my citizenship and you couldn’t care less that I’m not one. When I didn’t have health insurance you didn’t care. When I wanted braces you never helped me until I finally became old enough to do it myself. I don’t have anyone to tell my secrets to. I don’t have anyone to guide me and I feel bad because you’re always alone but it doesn’t seem like you care and want me near you.

"Everytime I think I'm finally doing well, for even a second, something else happens which fucks me over.","I just feel like something put there is telling me to kill myself. It just keeps throwing shit out me till I give up. I think I can finally take a breather. And then theres something else to stress about. This time, I was about to be late on rent. But I did all I could to get the money together. (I'm not even gonna say all the things I did to get the money) but then. I just got off work. And I was about to swing by the bank to withdraw the money to lay rent. But then my car wouldn't start. And I'm completely alone in this state. So I had to call someone to come out and jump me. But it wouldn't jump. So I had to spend money to get it towed. Then the damn mechanic shop jerked me around, and ended up fighting with them alot ( I use to be a mechanic so I know when I'm getting jerked around) but they were so incompetent, that it took them 6 hours to basically figure out that the battery needed to be replaced and then do it. They lied to me when they told me the tested the battery when they first pulled it in the bay. They put a new starter on, without telling me until after the fact. And then told me my engine was seized up due to there being 0 oil in it. Which I dont know if I believe, because I just got my oil changed about a week and a half ago. And I know I dont have a leak. So either they were lying or the technician at the luge shop didnt put oil back in my car. But anyway, long story short. They forced me to pay 600$ for basically a battery change. And then I had to go back to work 2 hours later, with no sleep since my last shift. So that was great. But that 600$ was going to be for my rent. No I dont have any money.

I hate the way I look,"Nowadays people are starting to embrace body positivity and are learning to love who they are. So why can’t I? Every time I look in the mirror all I see are flaws. My stomach bulges out too much, my face is fat, my acne is ugly, I need to shave, my teeth are yellow, my butt’s too small, etc. Why can’t I see the good in myself?

My biggest insecurity is my stomach. I can’t help to think that I’m fat even though I have an average BMI at 5’5” , 140 with playing a sport/working out every day.  I think this insecurity sort of stems from everyone around me being stick thin. This one girl in my grade keeps saying how “fat” she is when she’s half a foot taller than me and weighs less. I know that shouldn’t bother me but it does. I also am a gymnast and seeing everyone around me be thin and look good in leotards makes me feel awful.

After eating a lot, I can’t help but be so mad at myself later for putting on so much weight, but sometimes I just can’t help it. I like food. It’s gotten to a point where my lunch is just a granola bar and I’m just hungry throughout my day.

If anyone has any tips to help raise my self esteem it’ll be greatly appreciated but honestly no ones probably going to see this. If you’re reading this, thanks random reddit user for listening to my rant. You’re breathtaking.

It drives you to do things you'll never forgive yourself for,"I remember the past few weeks were the ones in the summer where I wasn't able to see you much. I felt so sick, not because I couldnt see you, but because I knew I would. The fact that everytime I seen you, you acted as if you loved me so much. Why did you? I never understood and I couldnt comprehend. I didnt believe you the slightest. And even the day I broke it off with you for the first time, I didnt understand why you seemed to be on the verge of crying. I didn't even say it out loud that I thought we weren't going to last, you just read me like a book. Whenever you read me, did i seem pathetic? All I felt was numb. My heartless self watched you walk away, and the last feeling id feel for a long time walked away too. I wish I could tell you about it all. I loved you so much. I tell these lies, apologizing how I didnt appreciate you enough then, telling lies to my friends about how I really felt. My only desire was to die, the quickest way to get it done was to get rid of you. In the end, I didnt die, but at the same time I did. I didn't even have enough energy to tie a knot or swallow any meds, it even felt so heavy to blink. Im horrible for acting like i hated you after, you acted like you hated me. I dont blame you for it, for me it was just a way to not let my pride down. We grew back together, we were so close. It got to the point we felt for eachother again. But I didnt understand why I was still fucking numb. I didnt want to be with you, I wasnt ready. I wanted to die. Everytime I almost did it, id somehow end up back where I started. I hurt you so much. Somehow, some way, we got through it. You never found out how I really felt. We made it. Im better. I love you so much. Everyday I'm wallowing in self hatred, because of the pain I caused you. Yet you had believed you were in the wrong? I don't understand that, i never will. You're always in my mind.

I can’t believe I’ve gotten this bad,"I understand losing a job. Losing your mom. Getting cheated on and finding out about it in the most cliche possible way. Losing hope in everything. I was so self destructive before and after. Just wanted to not feel. Way before any of this shit started to happen. It’s difficult accepting and understanding what’s happened in the past has effectively shaped you in a negative and positive way. But most of us stop there. I’m stopped there. The negative way, it’s so easy to get caught in that loop. We can be right about some things but it doesn’t change anything. I say I can’t believe I’ve gotten this bad for good. I won’t bore anyone with details of my childhood as we all have a few nights worth of stories. Just know you always have a decision and it’s yours. Right now it’s pretty hard at 25 years old I’ve let myself be manipulated by my own father and my ex. I remember at a younger age feeling like I don’t deserve to feel sad and I shouldn’t. Now I think it’s just a plain joke and I’m being tested. Not religious or whatever didn’t mean that but fuck, life is getting a little too real. I just got a letter from my school they approved a grade change appeal. I just stopped showing up. For 2 semesters. I have my suspicion due to the community I’m from and the major/degree I was going in for they are tight knit and had my back(if you’re from this community you will probably know). When I received the letter my first response was anger that they would let someone like me back. But it’s time to be done with all my self searching. For so long I would be thinking what could I change/tweak about me to make more people like me. What can I change to make me think that I don’t care about what people think even though that was on my mind 99% of the time and stressing me out. I’ve been stuck in the past and it’s time to move on. It’s unfortunate that for so many of us we know something is wrong and we want to change. So many of us don’t know how. I still don’t know how. But I’m going to fucking start. I’m starting here. My next step is doing less things that don’t get me anywhere and more thing that move me forward.

Depression or laziness?,"For quite a long time now, I've been restless, not enjoying life at all(anhedonia), and lacking any sort of motivation to do anything at all. For a while I thought I was lazy, but I'm quite a rational person, and even when I've made full sense of why I should get up and do a thing, I recede into doing nothing again. I just don't seem to care enough about anything, nothing seems to be worth my effort. I have no passions or liking to things, I just sit there on my computer all day/TV. 

Most days I see no reason to get up or do anything healthy/productive. It's quite a nihilistic out view I have. I must say, I'm quite optimistic. As contradictory as that sounds I always look on the bright side of things, as it always bodes a better result.

Am I extremely lazy or depressed? I sure feel down most of the time, when I'm with friends it's okay, but it's not like any of my laughs or smiles are genuine however; I feel emotionless most of the time.

I'm 21 and tired of asking for a ride like I'm 15 again. I feel worthless because I suck at school (I'm in PA school and am struggling in 2 classes) and I won't get any of the scholarships I even apply to because I'm a white female whose dad and stepmother both have great jobs (though we're still not great financially because of shit my biological mother caused), and my GPA isn't good enough. and my professors won't write me a recommendation because I suck at school and iv only known them for about 5 weeks. so now idk if I can even pay for the rest of my school. I can't work during PA school because my days are 15 hours long including class and nonstop studying. I am never going to be good at anything. I have endometriosis and my surgery was supposed to be during the 3 weeks chunk I have off between spring and summer semesters but now I can't because they're booked so I have to spend 9 more months being in pain. I can't go anywhere, I'm trapped here with my own thoughts. I hate my family situation because my dad is rude and critical, my stepmom is a bitch, and my mom ruined my family. there is literally no point to living because I can't ever have anything I want nor is my life fair in the slightest. fuck it all I want to die but I don't. I just don't want to deal with anything anymore.

Venting a bit,"I realized recently that I might have bipolar disorder based on a couple of friends I know who have it and also the symptom checklists that I have looked at. I have been diagnosed with general anxiety as depression but lately it’s felt more than that, particularly in the swings between extreme optimism and sociability, and pessimism’s day depression. 

Anyways I was looking online and found an online counseling website. One of the boxes you have to fill out is info that the counselor will look over in order to have a better understanding upfront. As I was filling it out I poured my heart into it and explained my feelings better than I ever had to anyone before, even myself. I was feeling like there was hope in figuring out what the fucks going on in my head. Then I hit the “next page” button and it brought me to the payment section.

Never did the website mention that it was a paid thing up until this page. I understand that it’s a business and the counselors have to get paid somehow in order to not do a completely shit job, but the fact that they didn’t mention that until you’ve already broken yourself down and opened up really pissed me off. It felt like they were saying, “okay what’s going on, what’s wrong? Oh no that’s unfortunate, now before I give you any help for all of the super personal stuff you just opened up to me about, I’m gonna need your credit card info. Oh you can’t afford it, well fuck off then.” 

It’s 3:23 am where I live and I feel completely stuck. I am a college student working two jobs just trying to make ends meet while also juggling the exhausting unpredictable bullshit in my head everyday, and the fact that I have to pay for help with something I didn’t ask for and wouldn’t wish on my worst enemy kind of astounds me at the moment.

I feel like my life's not gonna get any better,"I post here and never get any responses but whatever.

I'm going to be turning 20 this year and waking up every morning is getting harder. I feel so lost and like I have no direction. I took a mental health day off from work and all it did was show me how much I don't do. I feel like I have no hobbies, I try play games but I lose interest after 5 minutes, I try work on Writing or Drawing and I lose any motivation almost instantly. The only way I can get any satisfaction is masturbation and afterwards I always feel disgusted with myself. I've tried going to school 2 times now and had to drop out halfway through the semester both times.

Can I say I have a mental health condition to an employer even if I haven't been diagnosed?,"Hello I am certain that I have been suffering from anxiety and depression for a number of years. As a result I completely withdrawn myself from society but the end of last year it was time for me to get a job, try and put myself back out there and hopefully make myself live bit more comfortably, and maybe give myself a chance of recovering life in my late 20s. I also believe I have dypraxia as I have difficulty talking to people in certain situations but I have complete fluency in others.

However, having got this job I'm experiencing a number of things of which I have experienced in every role since I have been working and that is people are quick to jump to conclusions, and this isn't me being paranoid. This is an accumulation of experiences that are similar for me and I know what will happen in a few months I'll be the most hated person at that job and everyday I go, they will most likely give me hell.

Can I say I have a mental health condition to my employer if I haven't been diagnosed? I don't really want them to personally attack me every time I enter a new workplace because I would like a chance of living too. Why are people so quick to assess one another then give them hell because one person front talk properly? 

I really needed a job which is why I never said anything about a mental health condition as I believe this would have almost certainly affected my chances. 

What should I do? Because if I don't do anything then I know what will happen during this adventure of employment, I will have to leave because of comments and accusations that aren't true. Something doesn't seem right there. Also, I know there is something wrong because hardly want to talk to anyone nowadays. I have no friends out of choice as an example. I dreamt of working very insular jobs growing up. Well may as well kill myself because no one can help they can give me placebos but they won't give me the one thing which will cure depression and other mental illnesses in an instant but they can't give me the job I wanted to do with my life so tell me what is the point?

Knowing that people cared about me made me want to kill myself even more.,"A month ago I was feeling suicidal. During that period I had a conversation with my son's 16 year old cousin from his mom's side of the family. During our conversation he mentioned to me how much he cares and looks up to me and how I was the only adult he could talk to about girls, his problems, and guitars (shit all teenage boys like to talk about). After our conversation I started thinking about what he said and about all the people in my life that care/depend on me (my son, parents, friends, etc.). And for some reason it seemed like more of a reason to kill myself. I found comfort in knowing that if I killed myself I would be missed. I knew they would be sad for awhile but eventually they would move on and think about all the good times we had. I liked knowing that despite my decision I would die knowing I had an impact on someones life.

Has anyone else felt that way?

I've been to my psychiatrist and adjusted my meds and know I'm doing great. I just thought I'd share incase someone can relate.",sad_comfort,1,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/fe9zu3/knowing_that_people_cared_about_me_made_me_want/,month ago wa feeling suicidal period conversation son 16 year old cousin mom side family conversation mentioned much care look wa adult could talk girl problem guitar shit teenage boy like talk conversation started thinking said people life care depend son parent friend etc reason seemed like reason kill found comfort knowing killed would missed knew would sad awhile eventually would move think good time liked knowing despite decision would die knowing impact someone life ha anyone else felt way psychiatrist adjusted med know great thought share incase someone relate,knowing people cared made want kill even,sad comfort
Literally Careless.,"I’ve been depressed since my last year of school so for 5 years now and nothing seems to make me happy. I’m convinced that life just isn’t for me. Recently I’ve lost everything I’ve got no job no money, I pushed all my friends away and pushed away a girl who loved me and would do anything for me. I block all my problems out and just isolate myself. I don’t open up to anyone I just say I’m fine. It’s gotten to the point where I don’t care about anything anymore. Whatever happens I just don’t care nothing bothers me or phases me I’ve been so unhappy for so long and no one even knows what goes on in my mind. I feel like it’s never ending. Most of the time I don’t want to live. I never tell anyone anything because I feel so embarrassed and people might not believe me but I’ve hid all this for so long... I stay awake because I have nothing to be excited about waking up to.

Self harm advice?,"I’ve cut myself with many different things over the years. First my nails, then scissors, then razor blades. It just kept going downhill.

Memories,"Do you ever just stare up at the roof of your house/apartment and wish you lived in an old rustic cabin in the wood? Having the ability to stare up at the old logs and beams instead of the flat surfaces in modern ones.

I am not okay,"Coping is no longer working. I'm not actively suicidal, but passive. I'm peeling my fingers bloody. Chewing my lip bloody. I want to shave my head. The last time I did that I was 21 and in serious need of mental health help. Or a hug. Who knows. I have chronic pain that is awful the last few years, relationship problems that he won't work out with me because he chooses to be stubborn and stand offish. 


I don't know how much more of life I can handle without cracking and shattering. It's been mostly abuse and loneliness with a few brief happy moments. I've inherited every crazy gene in the family on top of that. I don't know how much I can take. So I want to shave my head because that will help.. somehow, I don't know. 


I'm just struggling in general. I don't know how to cope anymore. Journaling helps for a few minutes. Crafting helps for a few minutes. Standing in the sun helps for a few minutes. I don't know how else to feel better because nothing feels better for long.

I'm such a loser,"I am so fucking lonely. I wish I had a significant other or a friend to tell me everything is going to be ok, that I don't need to give up and kill myself. That I don't need to worry so much about my future.. I just crave attention. The lack of human contact is depressing. At least I have a family, but will I just live with my mom forever? without ever having my own house, my own money, my own life?

Everything seems so uninteresting and boring. I'm just so tired of having no motivation to chase my goals. I feel like I once I had the potencial to have a good life, but somewhere on the way I lost my purpose. I'm still young but I feel like I've missed out on so much already.

I hate myself. I hate my inability to live a normal life.

Guess I'll just listen to sad music, drink alcohol, masturbate to porn, and cry myself to sleep tonight like every other day. At least I get to feel something. My mind is so broken, I'm just a piece of trash, a sad excuse for a human being.

I'm a talentless loser. Even If I wanted, I couldn't be succesful in any career or job. I'm too slow, too dumb.

This sub is nice to chat with other people in a similiar situation, but it's also just an illusion. It's not like anyone here cares about me either. Every single day I think about comitting suicide and I really feel like I'll do it in the next few days. In a way I feel kinda guilty for having those thoughts cause I really think this earth is amazing, I hate myself for wasting my life like that but I think it's the only way i'll feel at peace with myself, though I admit i'm scared of death, I'm scared of the emptiness that will come after. but I'm also scared of the emptiness I feel now, while I'm still breathing yet unable to feel true joy and enjoy it to the fullest. I guess 2019 is my last year. I'm crying as I type this, I just wish things were different, I wish I was much more than I am now. I rarely leave the house but when I do I always feel a bit sadder when I see a couple together or just a group of friends having fun. I know I'm too awkward and weird to live life like they do. I know it's pathetic, but it's just the way it is. And obviously I have big self steem issues and hate the way I look. Every time I look in the mirror I think of how ugly and disgusting I am, I actually try to avoid looking because I know I'll get depressed(more than I usually am on a regular day). I keep writing these posts on reddit because it's better to share the way I'm feeling than just rot in my room, maybe I can find some cool person to chat with and make my existence a bit less miserable? who knows. I really feel sorry for my parents, cause they have no idea how I really feel, and I just can't picture myself saying all this to them. I wish I could kill myself without making my family suffer. They don't need to just because I'm a piece of shit loser

I know there’s something wrong with me and I hate that I can’t figure out why,"I feel like my life is spiraling out of control and I have no idea why and I hate it so much. Nothing ever seems to go right for me and I’m stuck in this stupid rut and I’m so fucking tired of it. My life is one long loop and I feel like there’s no purpose to any of it and I honestly just want it to be over because I have no idea what to do. I don’t have the energy to do anything I love anymore and nothing makes me happy because even if it’s going well I know that it’s just on the surface and deep down I still wish I was dead. I worthless, like I just take up space and I don’t deserve to get help. My little sister started going to therapy last year after my parents found out she was harming herself but I can’t even count the amount of times I’ve sat on the floor sobbing to my mom about how I can’t take being alive anymore and no one has done anything to try to help me. I’m begging for someone to help because I feel like no one cares. 

The worst part is being tired. I’m so fucking sick of being exhausted no matter what I do. I’m always in a fog no matter how much sleep I get and I can’t focus or think. My head always hurts. I feel like my body is shutting down. I don’t have an appetite and I lost about 20 lbs since the summer. I gained some back and started hating the way I look so that’s going for me too now. Now I don’t eat because 1. it makes me feel sick 2. I hate the way I look 3. I know it’ll hurt me. I’m fucking sick of all of it. 

For my entire life, I’m supposed to have been perfect. I can’t admit any of this to anyone because I’m so scared of being pitied or being vulnerable. My grades are slipping and I don’t know how to deal with it because my entire life is being a perfect student who’s going to get into a perfect college and if I can’t do that I’m fucking worthless and I should just be dead. On top of all that I think I might be a lesbian, and that is one of the things I hate most about myself, more than my body or personality or grades or anything else. 

I think about killing myself every single day but I’m too scared to do it. I have a plan and I have a suicide note written down just in case so it’s ready if I decide to ever do it. I don’t even want to die. I just want all of this garbage to be over. I’m 17 and I feel like I’m not going to make it another year if things keep going the way they are and I’m honestly scared. I just wish I was never born so that I wouldn’t even have to go through killing myself and that way no one would be hurt if I was dead. If I die I don’t have to apply to college or come out or worry about failing any more or eat or hate the way I look or hurt myself or anything because it would all just be over and I wouldn’t have to deal with any of this shit.  I’m so fucking tired of all of it. I can’t even think of a legit reason why I feel this way and that’s what I hate most of all. Everything is going wrong and there’s no tangible reason why and that makes me want to panic. I’m so frustrated and I have no outlet for any of it and I don’t even feel like a human any more. My whole life is barely keeping my head above water in school, coming home and chugging green tea so I don’t eat, and wanting to kill myself when something small goes wrong. I just want it to be over.

Secretariat was right,"I'm rewatching Bojack Horseman on Netflix for the umpteenth time because that's the only thing I do that I enjoy anymore. 

I've recently noticed that in the show Secretariat is right, that you should never stop ruining, never look back, all that you have is what's ahead. That's what I've been doing and it seems to be working as long as I don't stop. 

My last relationship almost killed me, my ex was abusive. Before her I survived since shit, sexual assaults and the like. I've done terrible things too, things for survival, some things simply because I was a bastard.

Now i keep myself busy. I work 50+ hrs and volunteer  for the entire weekend. I have pets that need constant attention, and I'm constantly moving. When I'm not running around I always have a drink in hand. It works. The only time I look back is when I'm falling asleep,  that's the worst. That's when I can't escape it. Thankfully sleep cones soon. But I need to keep moving. If I stop I'll be consumed. Im terrified of that. I can't handle that. I can't relive it, I just can't. 

I don't know what to do anymore. I come from a long line of alcoholics and I'm fast on my way to join them. I'm so tired but I can't risk showing down. I just wish it would end but I'm too scared to do anything about it. I'm ruining as fast and as hard as I can but I'm slowing down and it's catching up.

I hate myself MASSIVELY.,"Okay, here it goes. I don’t really care if this isn’t a throwaway account, it’s whatever.

During the beginning of my teenage years, (13) I didn’t care about anything, how i looked, or anything of that sort. Looking in mirrors was fine, and life was good.

When i hit 14 i sent a really horrible selfie of myself to a group of online friends, was bullied really bad for it, and so on. From then on i’ve been incredibly alert of myself, if you know what i mean. 

I stayed with this friend group because they were the only people i knew and could talk to, my parents hated me for being gay, and my brothers only took in their footsteps. After this, i just completely broke down, got so insecure that i wore a jacket for a year because i was so scared of anyone seeing me. That ended when i was 14. 

I stopped because i just decided to stop feeling sorry for myself and that i was the only problem in that situation. Since then, it’s only gotten worse. I now spend all time i can get in my room, under a blanket, won’t call anyone because i don’t want anyone to hear how bad i sound, don’t let anyone see me because of how bad i look, etc. 

I’ve attempted suicide once, and that one time my dad walked in on me trying to hang myself. I’ve given it lots of thought since then, and honestly, every day it feels like a better option.

I don’t know why i’m posting this, something in me told me to post this here.

Hope they would just pass without causing any problems... they usually would and because of that I thought it would be a good way to deal with stress and all of that. I was wrong. Ever since I tried being more and meeting more people and making my life more exciting it just hasn’t worked. If anything it made things worse. Stuff just keeps getting added to my bottle and now the cap doesn’t even fit on the top. It’s affecting the people I’m around and I don’t like it but I also don’t want to tell them what is wrong because I don’t want them to worry or be concerned. My feelings are leaking and I don’t like it because they are noticing. I feel like I’m doing more harm to them by not telling them. I just want everyone to be ok but I don’t want them to know...suicide has been a very present thought in my head but I don’t want to leave...it would just hurt them more..hopefully my thoughts on that won’t change or else I won’t be here for long...

Today I hate myself more than I usually do,"I did something stupid. 

I only talk to one person about my mental health. She is the only person who has ever helped me not be depressed. After being depressed and okay-ish at my best for about a decade, talking to her made me feel happy. And it wasn't just for a minute, an hour, or a day. I felt happy for about half a year. 

That was what led me to tell her. I wanted to thank her, and I couldn't say thank you without telling her why. When I told her about my mental health, she was supportive. Even though I haven't felt happy in about five months, I still look forward to talking to her.

But today I did something stupid. I started an argument over something that so trivial that one noticed it. Usually when I am speaking to anyone, I try to think about what I say before I say it, because I would hate to say anything that bothers people, but not today. Today, I when I was with her, I didn't once stop to think about what I was saying. If it came to mind, I said it. 

I didn't think she was bothered until she told tried to tell me something like ""I spend my whole life making sure I don't... Isn't it ironic that that I end up doing that?"" As she said that, I saw her face get red and ber eyes start to tear up a little. And I realized that I was being a fucking asshole. 

She has never asked me to do anything. Not a single time. She has helped me when I am having suicidal thought. She has helped me when I feel like I am about to have a mental breakdown. She has helped me through a lot. And I just go and return the favor by being the worst person to her.

I have been trying to distance myself from her, because in the past couple of months, life just hasn't felt like its for me. I don't think that I should ever feel better. Depression is exactly what I deserve. Everytime I have caught myself feeling a little better, I just tell myself what I have to feel like shit again. Now, I will find it easier to no longer talk to her. As much as I looked forward to talking to her, I look forward to her forgetting me.

There isn't a whole lot keeping me from having the thought that makes me take my last, she is one of the two things that even just thinking of her helps me keep the suicidal thoughts just thoughts. I think she still wants to talk, and I know I will see her for at least the next 2 months, but when those 2 months are up. I won't talk to her, and I will do everything that I can to keep me from ever talking to her again. I don't want to make her sad or ever make her cry again.

Right now, I know I probably won't gather up the courage to end it, because I still have to see her. But I did resently take up self harm. I started by hitting my upper thigh, so no one would see the marks. Recently, I started growing out my hair, so that no one will notice that I started hitting my head. A while after I see her for my last time, the odds that I'll finally do it will rise.

I fucking hate that I possibly made someone feel anywhere near how if feel most of the time. I hate myself even more for doing it to the only person I have ever felt safe enough to tell everything about anything.",IH8MyThoughtsAtTimes,0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/fe9mia/today_i_hate_myself_more_than_i_usually_do/,something stupid talk one person mental health person ha ever helped depressed depressed okay ish best decade talking made feel happy minute hour day felt happy half year wa led tell wanted thank say thank without telling told mental health wa supportive even though felt happy five month still look forward talking today something stupid started argument something trivial one noticed usually speaking anyone try think say say would hate say anything bother people today today wa stop think wa saying came mind said think wa bothered told tried tell something like spend whole life making sure ironic end said saw face get red ber eye start tear little realized wa fucking asshole ha never asked anything single time ha helped suicidal thought ha helped feel like mental breakdown ha helped lot go return favor worst person trying distance past couple month life felt like think ever feel better depression exactly deserve everytime caught feeling little better tell feel like shit find easier longer talk much looked forward talking look forward forgetting whole lot keeping thought make take last one two thing even thinking help keep suicidal thought thought think still want talk know see least next 2 month 2 month talk everything keep ever talking want make sad ever make cry right know probably gather courage end still see resently take self harm started hitting upper thigh one would see mark recently started growing hair one notice started hitting head see last time odds finally rise fucking hate possibly made someone feel anywhere near feel time hate even person ever felt safe enough tell everything anything,today hate usually,ih 8 thought time

I kinda need advice?,"So these past few months my mental health has been getting worse and I don’t know if it’s because of these two friends I have, because I don’t want to put all the blame on them. So I met one of them at the beginning of the school year and the other one I’ve known for a while but we never really talked and they were really nice to me and we had lots of fun hanging out after school since we were on the same bus. But as time went on they kinda got mean? One of them would sometimes slap me or punch me in the stomach but when I would stand up for myself they would be like I’m over reacting or something. The other one just confuses me since one day she would be praising me saying “you’re so smart” “ how are you so good at everything” then the next day she’ll be like “ you’re so fucking dumb you’re and idiot” “aren’t you smart so like you’re supposed to know that” “don’t you even know fucking anything” just to make it clear I never really liked having those types of compliments since it made me uncomfortable since it’s like what if I all of a sudden don’t meet their expectations or something. I feel like my “problem” is just me overreacting but I’ve been trying to distance myself but on the bus while they’re next to me I can hear them talking shit about me. I keep to myself around them I don’t talk to them but they still talk to me asking why are you ignoring us. Again I’m probably just overreacting but I just need advice on what I should do since I’ve been getting more anxious and what they say about me gets to my head sometimes.

What depression feels like,"I can’t put it into words all the time but depression to me feels like I go through life with this tight tight pressure just squeezing on my heart all day long and I just have to ignore it and go throughout my day with nobody knowing what’s going on. But when I snap and I cry it’s because the pressure has just built up too much and I just can’t handle it anymore but I only snap in private because once you cry and once those emotions are out of your system and you have momentary relief you think, well that was silly and it’s not that deep I’m fine. And then this cycle of pressure builds up all over again and you just have to pretend like nothings wrong but you’re truly not ok. 
I can’t explain this to the people in my life cause I’ve always thought maybe I’m just making up my depression because I can go throughout my day. I’m not bed bound. But if I reflect on my life, I’ve always tried to cope in some way. I used to binge eat so much and I notice I have the urge to do it whenever I’m feeling especially down. Then it was movies &amp; tv shows I would drown myself in for hours and hours. Then it was music to drown out my own thoughts. It was reading endlessly at some point but I’ve lost all interest in all of those things and I find being awake to be so draining so now all I do is go to my classes and go to sleep. I hate being awake. I hate feeling this pressure in my chest and it sucks because I was free from it for a few months and it’s back and you just try and tell yourself you’re just having a bad day but you know it’s some sort of relapse. It’s hard because I don’t want to take medication, I don’t know if that’s going to make things worse for me and I don’t want to be numb I just don’t want to feel pain. On top of that there’s so much fucking stigma. I can’t talk to my parents about it cause whenever I do they get angry I feel sad because I’m their eyes they’ve given me the perfect life despite all the abuse when I was a child. I can’t talk to my friends cause they’re all optimists with the “it gets better” attitude and it pisses me off cause all I want is to get held and just cry. I always feel like I’m being punished for something and I don’t know what cause I try so hard to be there for others. Whenever I can’t find love and I see ordinary people super happy in relationships I question what’s wrong with me (I’m not saying I’m super attractive but I have assets that would at least attract people). when I start questioning why I can’t find a good relationship or someone who likes me it loops back into my thought of well how do I expect that to happen if my own father walked out on me as a child.

Tossed aside.,"You guys ever been tossed aside like last month’s trash? Not a great feeling, especially when you already feel fucking worthless. My particular instance of this is made even worse by the fact that this situation arose from a douchebag throwing tons of money at the target of my affection.

I suppose what I should take away from this situation is that the girl in question is a money-grubbing whore. When I did have some disposable cash she was really sweet and affectionate. Not anymore since this fuckface entered the scenario. I’m really fucking fed up with this.

I'm tired of the pain.,"I just can not keep doing this anymore. I keep reaching out for help, doctors push pills on me (I'm on five now) and therapists just try to push me into blaming my dead father. 

I can't afford my home. I can't afford my bills. I can't afford food and even the subreddits that claim to offer help just delete my posts because I lurk and my account doesn't have hundreds of karma.

I do not know what to do. I cry constantly. I hate my life and myself. I can't sleep I can't eat. 

I try to open up to people and they look at me like a monster.

I am a monster.

I'm about to lose my home and I have nothing left to sell to try to hang on to it. I sold all my dads belongings to make ends meet, he left those to me so I could have a good fun life and here I am a piece of garbage who can't even work a part time job to buy groceries. 

The state turns me away because I have income ($944/mo in disability).

I'm done. I can't do this. Why am I fighting? For who? I'm alone. My chest hurts, my eyes hurts. My head spins and I do not even know if any of this makes sense. I just can't keep this up. I have been fighting since I was a child, I'm a 38 year old man (ha) now. What do I have to offer to this world? All I am is a leech. I have no skills. I was never good in school because of my mental illness and no one would diagnose it.

I hate myself and so does the world.

Bipolarity is a curse,"I might become homeless. Just had an episode and spent my savings, can't bring myself to work more than
15 hours a week.
I binged on xanies and fucked a stranger the other night, I've been hanging out with a married man. The man I really love can't handle me but won't let me go for some fucking reason. I have no support system, everyone's only halfway there for me because I'm just too unpredictable and sick for anyone to consistently keep up with my needs.

I just turned 26, I wanted to do something with my life by now, I can't even handle a ft job and my adulthood has been a clusterfuck of mental illness and grief. I need to be on drugs but I'm terrified of them bc I'm so low functioning that my life will be ruined if they make me any worse. It's been like this for years. Years!!!!!! I don't know how to get better, I see my other mentally ill friends not getting better, and the older I get the more worried I am that I'll have no choice but to concede to the reality of a lifelong struggle w/o much hope for anything even remotely resembling security/ property/ prosperity/ FAMILY

I'm jealous of high functioning people.

the first step.,"I've felt this way for a very long time. The feeling of inadequacy, the contempt of others, the anger, and the overwhelming loneliness. For such a long time, I've kept it bottled up, but now its beginning to boil over and I don't know how to handle it. This is my first time admitting to this and I think its easier to admit in anonymity than to my family. They wouldn't understand these feelings and I inevitably chase all of my friends away.  I have no hobbies or anything that I am good at so I just wallow in my sadness.  I dont want to be so absorbed in my own issues but its hard to overlook when it begins to bleed over into the things I used to care about like school. Being alive has never been a feeling that I can remember feeling happy about.I've come to live with pain and failure but I would just like the feeling to stop and feel even a modicum of  ""okay-ness."" Despite everything, I cant say I'm better off and I simply do not want to deal with any of it anymore to be honest.

"I'm at the end of my rope, and dont see how this could get better.","I'm a 26 year old male. I'm always, ALWAYS worried about something. It could be big, or it could be small, but no matter what im always worried. When I say worried, I'm not talking about your everyday anxiety. I'm talking about constant panic attacks. Im 26, and I've had people guess I'm 40. The only time I have relief is in my sleep. Everytime things seem to be looking up, something always manages to go wrong. My anxiety has turned into rage over the years, and I'm getting closer, and closer to snapping everyday. I clean brathrooms for a living, and someone could so much as ask me if they could use the bathroom as I'm trying to clean it, and I want to rip their heads off there fucking shoulders. I'm almost afraid I might hurt someone soon, as I feel I have nothing to live for anymore. I've felt how I do for the past 10 years, and it's not getting any better. I'm a vile person. I've been told by countless people, that I'm a vile person. If you knew what I've done, youd think I was a vile person. Theres no turning back from the things I've done, that's why i have nothing to lose, and i feel it's time to inflict my pain upon others.

Struggling,"A few years ago I was depressed and suicidal for several different reasons. I thought I worked through it. I thought I was better. But I’m 22 now and for about the last year, things have been gradually getting worse. I’m at the point now where I guess I’m probably passively suicidal? I have suicidal thoughts but I have no intention on acting on it. The urges to self harm have also occasionally come back, but I haven’t done anything.

I’m frustrated because nothing specifically happened to bring me back here. It just happened. I’m really struggling to see the light at the end of the tunnel. It feels like I put all that work in for nothing, I’m almost right back where I was and why keep putting so much effort into something that’s futile and I’m always just gunna end up here again.

I’m not quite at my lowest low, but I’m afraid if something doesn’t change I’ll get there. I guess for as long as I’m scared of being suicidal that’s hope.

Idk, I feel lonely and the few people close to me wouldn’t understand. I know that sounds cliche but truly none of them have had depression, and when I’ve tried approaching it they say something cliche and unhelpful like “things will get better I promise.” Or “try taking a walk, the sun and movement always helps me” Like yeah wow thanks I never thought to do that before lol. Granted maybe it’s partly my fault bc I haven’t really said the full extent of it so they don’t know how bad it is. But I still just don’t think I’d get anything helpful from them.

And idk if I’m gunna get anything helpful from here either and I’m not even really sure what my point is with this post, I’m just venting.

I feel like I'm doomed to just have bad luck,"I'm not a believer of anything spiritual or supernatural, but it truly does feel like I was cursed with bad luck or some shit.

A lot of it is just small things. Constantly getting the worst loot in video games, missing the public bus by like 30 seconds, etc. I always make small personal bets with myself like if I get a notification on Instagram I'll just be like ""I bet this specific person didn't like this post"" and I look at the notification and it's exactly that. This kind of shit is constantly happening everyday. By themselves it's not bad at all, but it really builds up and starts eating away at you.

And then there's bigger things. Like being 5'2 as a male is pretty bad. I have mental illnesses and some of it I can't even relate with other mentally ill people. I get bronchitis like every fucking year. And then tonight, I just got news that a field trip to Hawaii that I've been looking forward to for FOUR FUCKING YEARS has been cancelled because of the coronavirus bullshit. Of course it had to be the ONE FUCKING YEAR IM A SENIOR AND ABLE TO GO.

It just all piles up so fucking much. I feel like I'll just constantly have bad luck in life. It makes me lose excitement in things I'm actually excited for because I'm just in that mindset that it'll go wrong because of my bad luck. Makes me wonder if it's even worth living if I'm just stuck with this shit.

I'm again crying out for help despite me not accepting it, or no one even giving me help; instead I'm getting help from the internet ""Oh wow how original, last time you did that you fell into a greater depression.""
 I hate my life, my family is horrible and struggling too. The world is fucked, people are disgusting; everyday I wish for a quick fucking death. I'm failing in school, I have no passion in what I do anymore and even better I don't know what I wanna be in the future.

It's funny, I went to one of those subreddits to make a friend in, and they fucking downvoted me. What a way to boost my confidence Internet. And make a friend. Fuck I hate myself.
I don't even know what I'm saying anymore. I want to sleep forever, I don't want to wake up tommorow to do my mock. I know I'll fail it. I'm a fucking failure.
Ask for help? I'm too worthless to ask, I won't accept it, I have too high standards or whatever. Idk. I've become the very thing I've sworn to destroy and that's a depressed sad fucking failure. I don't know what to do.
I'm just another one of the millions asking for help only to not take it. I'm unmotivated to do anything. God I want to cry so much.

I don't know what to say, and I would feel guilty saying this to the people around me because I will bother them. 

I told it to my best friend but she is suicidal and severely depressed and she started to self harm again after I told her I self harmed and I don't want to make her feel worse. I want to support her although I don't have the strength to do that. I told it to a friend and to my sister as well and although they are helping and kind, I don't want to tell them how bad I feel. I don't know how to.

I tried to see psychologist but I have to wait untill at least april. This is a free psychologist and I can't afford to see another one earlier if it means I have to pay. My credit card has been stolen anyway lol.

Anyway, my way of coping with all of this is to put myself in danger and make myself feel physically bad in the hope I will feel more valid in my suffering and that I will finally be able to ask for help and feel like I deserve it. 

Does someone else feel this way here ?

I just want to feel less alone,All my friends live out of town. I had to go no contact with my mom again. Usually the only person i speak to on the day to day is my 8 yr old. Im 29 and don't know how to make friends. Occasionally someone moe extroverted will make friends with me but it always ends with them taking advantage of my kindness so i have to drop them from my life. Im tired of being alone. Im tired of being disabled. Im tired of all my mental illnesses. Im tired of wanting to die. I need to be held so bad.  A judge once told my mom she shouldn't have had kids. He was right.

I'm starting to have unrealistic thoughts of the future,"Home life is really bad at the moment, both parents are alcoholics and recently their drinking had been getting a lot worse. It's cause both sides of my family to argue due to my parents lack of care over my younger sister. I want to move out but I do not have the money, I don't really have anywhere to go, I want to call social services on my parents (again) but I can't as I'll be kicked out and have my belongings potentially trashed. My parents have never been there for me, I didn't have the best childhood, which has caused me to have an unfortunate array of mental disorders and depression. But now I'm starting to think I'll win the lottery of 1 million and everything will be okay, I keep thinking I'm going to win money and then I can move out and give me and my sister a better life for both of us. It's getting to the point that I'm daydreaming constantly of winning a large sum of money, and that I can get my own place and my sister will be okay. Ive started to genuinely think I'm a millionare. I'm that depressed I'm having unrealistic dreams and thoughts of the future so I don't think of what's happening at home and I don't know what to do.

Cursed,"I feel like I’m cursed. I don’t understand what I’ve done to deserve this. I try to be good, I’m not an evil person... I care, I try to be there, I try to help to others. My entire life has been shit... addicted parents who’ve never been there emotionally for me, abusive relationships, eating disorders, anxiety, depression... 

It’s funny how one little thing can change everything. As March started, I truthfully started feeling better, things were on the up and up... I even went to the gym and worked out yesterday, fully motivated to keep it going. Then, last night yet another curse. Now we’re back at square one, and the worst part is I have no one. I’m alone, physically and emotionally. I don’t have any friends or family to talk to or confide in. My partner is just as bad as I am in terms of mental state, so I can’t rely on him emotionally at all. I’ve managed to get through so many things in my life... and I thought they would make me strong.... but I was completely wrong. I’m weak.

"""Chemical Imbalance""","&gt; **[Trigger Warning: self-harm descriptions]** I found this in my notes in my phone from 4 years ago. I forgot how much I used to write about what it was like living inside my mind back when I was at my lowest point.

**Chemical Imbalance**  

It always starts with something taken out of proportion. A misread text, a misunderstood gesture, a misjudged opinion, or a misguided tone.  
“I love you.” They attempt to bring you back to a reasoning reality.  
But love isn't *love* anymore.  
Love is fake.  
Love is wrong.  
Love is *hate*.  
*I hate you*. Their mimicked voice echoes.   
Triggering the avalanche of spiteful words spraying from your pale lips.   
*They hate you*. The voice darkens.  
You watch them slowly fall into your torturous whirlwind of abuse. You watch them cry for help and ask for you to stop and listen to yourself, listening to you hate yourself and want to die is too much for them.  
Then you watch them leave. You watch them run away in fear.   

Your bony fingers crack as they clench into a fist. Your jagged nails are digging into your skin.   
Anger engulfs your vision, taking control of rationality.  
The first blow strikes hard on your face. It stings, but you go a second time. And a third. Until your head starts ringing.   
*You seriously fucked up this time*. The dark voice echoes.  
You can't see anything for what it really is.  
“But you said they hated me!” You argue with the little self-worth you have left.   
*Yes, and you believed me. You stupid little girl*.  
That restless feeling of guilt starts trickling down your spine. Did you jump to conclusions? Did you just impulsively hurt a loved one’s feelings? Did you just make them witness something so traumatic it will never leave them?  
*Yes, you're a twisted abuser*.  

No, you can't be here. You can't be alive anymore. You don't deserve it. You have hurt someone who needs you, you have acted out of spite.  
*Do it. You're worthless. They don't want or need you here*.  
More impulsive actions unfold, you only want to escape the guilt and anger that overfills your head. But you're scared to do it. You're scared to make the final exit by your hand.   
*Cowardice. You can't live and you can't die. You are pathetic*.  

The razor is in view. Tears are finally pushing out, causing more pain than the blade that now pierces your skin. Scarred and thin, the skin breaks. But no satisfaction is found unless you cut too deep. Only disappointment seeps in, blaming yourself for your cowardly slashes. Not going deep enough, pathetic little scratches. Why can't you feel more pain? Why can't you cut deeper?   
*You fail at even the simplest things*.  
You cut more. Faster, harder. You want centimetres, not millimetres.  
But still the same depth, still the same shit.  

There’re too many cuts now. But still no pain, only numbness from the raw wounds you view.   
But the blood won't stop. Your wrists are painted. Like stained crimson cloaks wrapped around each arm.   
You slip in the dark puddle and feel the red wetness of the towel you clench.    
“Take me!” You scream.   
“Please just take me!” You keep screaming at the otherworldly force.   
Pleading for the way out, pleading your heart would just stop.   
Now a mess of tears and blood on the floor, you weep.   
The sounds of silence bounces in your head.  
The dark voice is gone.   
Nothing.  

A door opens.   
The realisation of someone witnessing the mess you are in kicks you up.   
You can smell the shame from your cold sweat. You can see the damage you've caused yourself and the one who is about the enter.  

“I'm sorry.” You whisper.   
You are numb and frozen as they wrap the bandages around your wrists.   
“I'm sorry.”   
You can see the pain in their eyes. You can feel the fear in their trembles. You can hear the confusion in their silence.  

*You don't deserve this love*. The dark voice echoes.   
And then you fall back into the abyss.",poppi__054,0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/fea7zb/chemical_imbalance/,gt trigger warning self harm description found note phone 4 year ago forgot much used write wa like living inside mind back wa lowest point chemical imbalance always start something taken proportion misread text misunderstood gesture misjudged opinion misguided tone love attempt bring back reasoning reality love love anymore love fake love wrong love hate hate mimicked voice echo triggering avalanche spiteful word spraying pale lip hate voice darkens watch slowly fall torturous whirlwind abuse watch cry help ask stop listen listening hate want die much watch leave watch run away fear bony finger crack clench fist jagged nail digging skin anger engulfs vision taking control rationality first blow strike hard face sting go second time third head start ringing seriously fucked time dark voice echo see anything really said hated argue little self worth left yes believed stupid little girl restless feeling guilt start trickling spine jump conclusion impulsively hurt loved one feeling make witness something traumatic never leave yes twisted abuser alive anymore deserve hurt someone need acted spite worthless want need impulsive action unfold want escape guilt anger overfills head scared scared make final exit hand cowardice live die pathetic razor view tear finally pushing causing pain blade pierce skin scarred thin skin break satisfaction found unless cut deep disappointment seeps blaming cowardly slash going deep enough pathetic little scratch feel pain cut deeper fail even simplest thing cut faster harder want centimetre millimetre still depth still shit many cut still pain numbness raw wound view blood stop wrist painted like stained crimson cloak wrapped around arm slip dark puddle feel red wetness towel clench take scream please take keep screaming otherworldly force pleading way pleading heart would stop mess tear blood floor weep sound silence bounce head dark voice gone nothing door open realisation someone witnessing mess kick smell shame cold sweat see damage caused one enter sorry whisper numb frozen wrap bandage around wrist sorry see pain eye feel fear tremble hear confusion silence deserve love dark voice echo fall back abyss,chemical imbalance,poppi 054

"problems in my new career path, now regretting it all.","*I apologize in advance for any terms i use which may not be common to most readers* 
I was once proud of this and now i see it as a neutral thing, but i joined the army. at first i loved the comeraderie, pt, rucks, etc. and basic was a lot of fun with the grenades, obstacle courses, etc. but now im an academic fail out from AIT (job training in the army). its really painful living as a holdover. for those who are thinking ""wtf is a holdover?"": a holdover is someone who for whatever reason failed from their training, got injured, or in at least moderately serious trouble. the job of a holdover is mostly sitting on bleachers all day near the drill sergeants officespace until the end of the workday.  they will sometimes clean or perform some paper work on occasion. i contribute nothing, do nothing, and all the while watching my old friends earn the exact position that i spent the last several months of working my heart out for. im not angry at them, so much as i am just really... frustrated. because of my jobs academic difficulty, this is really not uncommon but ive been stuck here as a holdover for over a month now. 9 hours per day, 5 days per week, of sitting and doing next to nothing. i feel like a drain on society while also miserable with the ""work"" i am doing. 

i used to think that i wasnt contributing to anything while training but was fine with it because my job was to learn to be a soldier. but now i have no job, no purpose, and none of the old freedoms i had as a civilian as a consolation. i still have to abide by the ""battle buddy"" system in which soldiers in basic and AIT cannot ever be without another soldier around except for very specific circumstances. i am not allowed off base (which is less than 2 square miles of space). and i cannot have things like electronics during the time in which im ""working"" to pass the time. this has all made me thoroughly reexamine my reasons for every decision ive ever made.

at first when i failed out i knew id be sent to a new MOS (army job). id hoped for armor (tank stuff), artillery, infantry, or really just anything except for signals (computers, which frustrate me to my wits end), medical (im afraid of needles), and transport (i hate working on cars). and the drill sergeant said the best case scenario, id be sent off to be an IT specialist. i was nothing short of devastated. 

Just one month ago, i was what youd think of when you thought of a bubbly, outgoing, and motivated soldier. Today i realized i had an issue when a drill sgt that i very much look up to came back after being gone for a few months and she noticed that i was showing signs of being ""off"" before i even really said anything. 

I used to be really great at pt, and now im doing so poorly that i may get kicked out of the army entirely. im stressed, saddened by my prospects, and overall just ashamed of where i am. if it werent for my gf whose been nothing short of incredible, there is no way i would have ever made it this far. but now it feels like in the process of joining the army, i started walking from new york to california, i was getting close to nevada until i tripped, got knocked the fuck out, and woke up in ohio. and now im just staring at the map thinking how itd be so much easier to just turn back and cut my losses.

It's unfair that I have to live with this burden everyday and they can go about their lives without caring.,"At the end of last July, a boy I thought I liked had a party at my house.

I've carried this ever since it happened and I can't make it go away, I can't stop thinking about it.

My family is moving out of that house now and I found a pile of the boy's shit that they all left at my house that night.

And my parents tell me im not allowed to tell a doctor, because the intrusive thoughts could endanger my planned out medical career. Life has become too much to bear and i cant take it. Ive become so stressed my eye has started to twitch almost every time i blink. I cant escape, and not even suicide is an answer anymore. It doesnt help that it feels like everyone god damn hates me. Any mistake i make, i always have a thought like ""wow, that person probably hates me now"" and i cant live with my own thoughts.

"I’ve lost 4 pounds since Monday, this is just getting worse","I don’t like to complain and so I don’t talk about my depression a lot to my friends/loved ones, I don’t want to worry them or be annoying. It’s been getting progressively worse recently though, I’m dropping weight like crazy (I’ve never had it interfere with weight before), when I do try to talk about it, things get minimized and nobody really gives a f*ck. I had my s/o tell me that I was “not really sad” yesterday, and that messed with me because not only has he not known me for the majority of my life, but just because I don’t like to talk about my problems doesn’t mean they don’t exist. He really has no idea. My mom is a therapist so when I try to talk to her she just gets overly worried, and my dad generally follows her lead with that. I understand why they worry, a couple years ago I had a pretty bad suicide attempt and a near fatal overdose (od was an accident, I was just being dumb) within less than 6 months of each other, they worry that it’ll happen again. It gets annoying though because I feel like I can’t even say I’m sad without “are you on drugs again” etc. Now that I think about it maybe this post doesn’t make sense/ is all over the place, I guess it’s easier to vent to strangers on the internet than the people in my life.",[deleted],1,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/fe407t/ive_lost_4_pounds_since_monday_this_is_just/,like complain talk depression lot friend loved one want worry annoying getting progressively worse recently though dropping weight like crazy never interfere weight try talk thing get minimized nobody really give f ck tell wa really sad yesterday messed ha known majority life like talk problem mean exist really ha idea mom therapist try talk get overly worried dad generally follows lead understand worry couple year ago pretty bad suicide attempt near fatal overdose od wa accident wa dumb within le 6 month worry happen get annoying though feel like even say sad without drug etc think maybe post make sense place guess easier vent stranger internet people life,lost 4 pound since monday getting worse,deleted

Why does no one talk about consent and decision making in a more serious context with depression?,"Recently, im going through a severe depressive episode and I did some things I would not have otherwise done that are now affecting my mental health further and affecting someone I love. 

I would like to hear those with severe depression talk about whether they feel they have the ability to consent and make decisions on sensitive matters during severe depressive episodes.

It feels like society tells everyone that it is their fault if they make a bad decision, that they are responsible for their choices, and most dont understand mental illness properly and to me its not that black and white. 

I want to know whether you think you truly have the capacity to be at fault for a decision youve made if it is something you would not have done outside an acute depressive episode.

Four abilities are usually assessed with decision making when I was looking around. The only studies I found were for research purposes (which saddens me, but thats a whole other topic).

The four abilities:
Understanding
Appreciating
Reasoning
Ability to express a choice

Now I cant say I know the exact ways to interpet these 4 things right now without further research but, do you feel you possess these abilities during a severe depressive episode? Do you possess some and not others? Does it vary? 

My answer would be during a severe depressive episode, I do not possess any of these reliably at every moment. It is not consistent enough for me to able to say I possess any of them during these times.

"When you try so hard, still fail. Depression is always there.","I have been through a very hard life, from my single parent mother being addicted to drugs, being in Foster care for 7 years, to being homeless for 6 years. I have and had finally gotten myself where I needed to be. I got a puppy I love dearly and has been my Emotional Support animal. I do everything in life for him now.

Need help,"Hi I don't really know how to phrase this situation but I'll try. My life is at a really good point right now, I'm never really depressed over stuff and 99 percent of the time my mind is clear. I'm about to graduate high school and I'm really excited. However, people in my family and friend group have tons of issues. Wether they sleep all day, hate themselves, or have no ambition to keep living on in this world, they've got problems. I don't wanna sound like I'm gloating, but usually I'm the person that a lot of these people end up going to because usually I'm able to talk people through issues and help them in the long run. Yeah sometimes their issues make me really sad and stuff because who doesn't feel sad when people are telling you they feel worthless.

But today one of my best friends showed me that he was cutting and it really effected me. I talked to him about it and it's mostly because of how painfully ""bored"" he is and he doesn't even know why he's doing it (he's a pretty logical guy). He will go to class and just sit there for and hour most of the time doing nothing challenging because that's the way our school works. He has clinically diagnosed depression, has been to a psychiatric ward, and sees a therapist regularly. It's only been a couple hours since he showed me his arm, and I didn't even see all of it. 

I've got two main problems right now. First I don't really know how to help him. He said literally the only thing I can really do is just hang out with him after school and on the weekends so he doesn't just sit in bed all day. I've been trying to make an effort to do that as much as I can but I need to do more. He said himself that as long as he goes to highschool, and considering it's the law, he's going to feel this way until we graduate. I just need to know something I can do to help him, do I tell his parents? A therapist won't help he already goes to one. Should I talk to him more about it tomorrow. I just don't know

Second, stuff like this is really effecting me. I just feel that the world is being unfair to everyone I care about and I just want everyone I love to feel better. As of lately I've been feeling depressed whenever my friends need to talk about issues and it's really weighing down on me. I just don't want to leave the people I care about down in the dirt. 

So yeah if anyone has any advice whatsoever please help me. Im normally able to deal with these feelings and help my friends but right now I'm struggling.

I miss going out and being able to socialize and I miss like dating and stuff and wearing clean clothes paying bills on time and not being behind miss having a drivers license and not being in fear everytime I get behind the wheel, miss having the Apartment for having girls just come over when ever they want, I miss eating good I miss shopping for things, 

Im barely living  and have been doing that for the past 3 years 

Everytime I get a job I try and fix my credit, and I can never seem to keep with it

I have to live my life with zero payments and buy everything with cash because I clearly can not keep up with them

Sometimes I wish my life was worse so I can receive sympathy,"My life, from an outside perspective, is objectively comfortable . I’m not terribly rich, but I have a roof over my head and food on my plate, with money to spare for my hobbies. I have a group of close supportive friends. 

I have depression. I’ve had it on and off since I was 11, but it’s been consistently bad for the past year. Everyday is filled with excruciating pain and loneliness.
But I often wish it was worse. I’m ashamed to admit that I sometimes wish my parents died all of a sudden or that my house will burn down or that I’ll get in a bad accident so that I’ll receive public sympathy. I’ll FINALLY have something concrete to complain about! Because guess what? Right now, I *don’t* have much concrete things to complain about. At least not things I can tell people publicly.

I guess another way to put it is that I’m desperate for attention, although I don’t like the connotation that comes with that phrase (as true as it may be). My head’s constantly battling these dark thoughts. My life is a living hell, and I’m frustrated that nobody’s taken notice, when it’s my own damn fault I’m not opening up to anybody. 

Man... I’m just so tired. I don’t know how much longer I can keep this up for. Everyday I think that this is the last straw.

And I was like, “BAD BRAIN!!!!!”

Life is just a cruel joke,"Do yall ever feel so numb and empty, but at the same time you feel so much pain and emotions ? And its so confusing but what are you gonna do about it ?  
Just last week I was feeling better, and now I'm back at the bottom

I don't understand. I have an amazing boyfriend and friends, my family is shitty but I know they do love me, I've just suffered from so much emotional trauma from them.

And I do feel happy sometimes. When I'm with my friends and boyfriend all we do is talk and laugh, but when I'm alone I feel so hopeless. Which makes me wonder if I'm actually even depressed.

It hurts, everything hurts so much.  
I just found out my, ""best friend"" who I've known for 6 years, doesn't want to be my friend anymore. Because I've been so busy with school, and I've been so stressed and just exhausted I haven't seen her in a few weeks and then I found out today from her brother.

My family is a wreck, my mom is always telling me about all her problems and I have to listen and counsel her, I'm just a teenager mom,  I wish you would take me to that doctors appointment like you promised you would so maybe I could actually get some help, instead of running off and leaving for days to God knows where.

I haven't been to church in weeks, church has always been so important to me, but lately I don't want to go, I don't want to see the people there that I've known since I was a baby. I don't want to do anything in my free time but lay on my bed.

I want to cry, I want to cry so badly but I can't. I physically cannot cry, and so I'm just here, shaking, in pain, and at the same time feeling nothing. I'm so scared, I don't want to do this anymore, I can't do it anymore I just want it all to go away. I want to go to sleep and never wake up. I wish I could be telling my friends these things, but I'm supposed to be the friend who has every thing together and helps everyone else.

I’ve genuinely totally forgotten most of my life, especially how I felt during previous periods of time. (This memory loss is related to dissociation and prolonged trauma as well as low serotonin)

I don't know what's wrong with me.,"Let me start of by saying I'm not diagnosed, I haven't really experienced any traumatic incidents in my life and I have no intention of harming myself.

However, due to events in recent months, I feel so empty, like I don't give a fuck about doing anything. Even feeding myself has become something I try to avoid. I don't take care of my appearance, I do the minimal work I need to get by and I rarely socialize with the few friends I have.

These are part in part to a belief that has formed in my head: life is meaningless. What is the point of doing anything? We slave away through school, to get a place at university, then we slave away through uni to get a good degree, then we slave away in a job we will probably hate to make sure we don't end up on the streets. All this, all this pointless cycle and in the grand scheme if things, it makes no difference.

I think a lot of times to myself, if I were to disappear now, would anything be affected? Have I had any impact at all on the world? Will I even be remembered? The answers are always no. This has produced an emptiness inside me.

The emptiness leads to a lack of people, activities and more, which in turn leave me feeling lonely and unfulfilled respectively. Yet I again feel a lack of desire to do anything. I don't know what this is or why I think like this, but I would appreciate it if anyone could give me some sort of method or exercise to break this cycle.",throwaway22599172i,4,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/fe64pv/i_dont_know_whats_wrong_with_me/,let start saying diagnosed really experienced traumatic incident life intention harming however due event recent month feel empty like give fuck anything even feeding ha become something try avoid take care appearance minimal work need get rarely socialize friend part part belief ha formed head life meaningless point anything slave away school get place university slave away uni get good degree slave away job probably hate make sure end street pointless cycle grand scheme thing make difference think lot time disappear would anything affected impact world even remembered answer always ha produced emptiness inside emptiness lead lack people activity turn leave feeling lonely unfulfilled respectively yet feel lack desire anything know think like would appreciate anyone could give sort method exercise break cycle,know wrong,throwaway 22599172

Feeling helpless and hopeless,"It's been a hard couple months. 

To break it down in a simpler manner; 
I'm a General Manager at a restaurant, working ~65 hours per week. My husband is 29 years old, diagnosed with Crohns about seven years ago. He has been unable to work for roughly 2 years. About a year and a half ago, he had a surgery that required removing roughly 6 feet of his intestines. Due to us not having health insurance until recently, hes been unable to do follow up appointments or get onto much needed medication to manage his disease. His Crohns is getting worse. We finally got him into the doctor's in January when we got health insurance. They've done several CT scans, and keep finding more and more abcesses developing in his intestines. He has another surgery scheduled for this upcoming Tuesday, but he had to go into the hospital again today, due to an abscess that is bulging out of his stomach. I have two puppies at home. With my husband being in the hospital, and myself working ridiculous hours, it puts a lot more on my plate than I have already with work. I feel like a narcissistic POS wife, because while my poor husband is in the hospital, I'm more worried about how much more stress has been put on me. 
I've been through a lot of trauma in my life. A physically abusive father growing up really messed with me, and I'm just now realizing the impact it's had on my every day life. I was in a 4 year relationship with a man who cheated on me the entire time we were together. He abused me physically, verbally and sexually. Manipulated me, and really mentally screwed me over. I was the one paying our bills (on $13 an hour) while he sat at home for 4 years doing absolutely nothing.

I'd like to hear how the world is still a good place,"I've been feeling incredibly lonely recently. My psychiatrist can't see me until next Friday (she isn't covered under my insurance).

TL;DR Tell me some kindness you've witnessed or received.

I have been unemployed since December and I was holding on until I got my tax refund so I could see my psychiatrist for new meds, fixing my car, anything until I can get another job. Then the government took it all for student loans.

I used all my energy and grit to get here, only to be still stranded and lower than ever. I don't talk to my friends anymore about it because they just think being strong is the key and that I will be fine. I don't feel fine. I used everything up and now I am here, jobless, broke, and not even caring to take care of myself anymore. What's the point, you know?

I would like to hear some kindnesses you've witnessed. I've given up thinking anything good will happen to me (after three years of being kicked in the teeth every three weeks) but I want to hear how the world is still a good place.",yukinakid,2,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/fe2wq6/id_like_to_hear_how_the_world_is_still_a_good/,feeling incredibly lonely recently psychiatrist see next friday covered insurance tl dr tell kindness witnessed received unemployed since december wa holding got tax refund could see psychiatrist new med fixing car anything get another job government took student loan used energy grit get still stranded lower ever talk friend anymore think strong key fine feel fine used everything jobless broke even caring take care anymore point know would like hear kindness witnessed given thinking anything good happen three year kicked teeth every three week want hear world still good place,like hear world still good place,yuk kid
Vacations,"I just got back from a week long stay on the big island of Hawaii. I had some of the coolest experiences from seeing a shark while snorkeling, to being right next to feeding manta rays. It was an amazing trip and I loved it so much. 

But the problem I have is that whenever I have gone on vacations, even when I was young, I would cry and be horribly depressed for the next few days to a week or two. I hate going on vacations because I know that I’m going to feel like shit after. Nothing feels right when I come home and I just want to be spending “one more day” out away from real life. I hate it because I know that I will have to go back to work and that I won’t get another vacation like this for a very long time. I hate that I can’t explain how I’m feeling to my wife because she’s lucky enough not to have to experience depression except from a third person perspective. 

I so badly want to still be out on Hawaii, or anywhere I’ve gone on vacation to, because out there, I don’t have to care about work; I don’t have to care about school, bills, or family drama. I can just be. I don’t want to have to go back to work and school on Monday, but I know I have to or else things will be worse in the long run. I hate that I’m feeling like I shouldn’t have gone to Hawaii in the first place. 

I loved spending all that time with my wife and enjoying that week together. I loved seeing things that I never have before and being somewhere that I haven’t been. I loved having that time to do whatever I wanted and not feeling badly that I didn’t do anything I didn’t want to. I loved the anticipation and excitement leading up to the day we left. 

I think that’s from where a lot of my depression stems: building up the anticipation, then it’s here and it’s so great, but then it’s gone sooner than it arrived, and you go back to anticipating nothing. 

I feel like life is mostly boring, dull, and no one really wants to admit that, so when you get a few days to enjoy yourself, after, it feels like the nothingness deepens and you sink further into it.

Feeling lonely and isolated,"Ok so I suffer with seasonal depression, and this winter has been significantly worse than last. Last winter I was around friends, and family. I was at home. This year I'm in a new city. I moved last summer for university, to try and get away from what/who I once was. I have met some amazing people here, but nobody seems to have any time to care for me. 

Heres a quick rundown of my 2020 so far:
I got a shoulder injury, had time out of the gym, was unable to compete because I was too weak. 
My girlfriend of 2.5 years and I split up. 
I developed a drug addiction to cope with the pain. 
I've hated my body more than ever and have lost all appetite and stopped eating. 
Sex drive has plummeted. 
Started hooking up with a girl but couldnt maintain an erection- realised I was using her for hugs and kisses to numb the feeling of loneliness.

I want to go to a doctor but my brain keeps telling me I'm feeling sorry for myself and this is all for attention. I even feel like this writing this post.

Lol!,All my friends and family are so confused by my increasingly poor life decisions lately and I never have a good excuse. What am I supposed to tell them? That I’m so upset that it feels impossible to prioritize even the most important tasks. That I feel so lost that I don’t give a fuck about the future consequences because of how much pain I’m in now? And why I don’t bother telling anyone? Why I just keep it to myself and don’t even want to use the word depression to describe myself? Because I honestly feel like a little entitled bitch trying to use mental health as an excuse for being lazy but I truthfully have not been content with anything in my life for the past 3 years and it feels like there’s no escape from my mind. I’ve fantasized my suicide several times a day everyday for the last few months even though I have no plans of doing so. It gives me disturbing comfort.

I don’t know what to write here,"I’m 22. I’ve dealt with depression since Highschool, and I thought I got better for...I was doing great, went to college, got a job...But recently my anxiety has gotten really bad again...I dated this girl for a little over a year, then I felt myself slipping back into that depression (it was a long distance relationship, I’m in Cali, and she’s back home across the country) anyway...I started getting bored I guess with the relationship because it was just like being in a relationship with facetime...We would try to meet up every now and then...But maybe saw each other about 3 to 4 times a year, and the distance just got in the way, and we decided mutually to sorta break it off. We would still FaceTime everyday, we’d pick a movie to watch together and it was just like we were dating still, but I couldn’t tell her I love her anymore. And that’s when my depression started coming back...Well, fast forward a few months, it’s Christmas I’m home, and she spends my whole first day with me and my family. We wound up sleeping together that night, then the next day she has to leave because she has a job in a different state...We talked about what had happened, and she said it didn’t mean anything. And I thought we were going to get back together again. But that never happened. Now, more recently...She started telling me about this other guy she’s dating, and I try to be supportive she’s moving on, so why can’t I? All I can think about is them together, and him making her happier than me, like I wasn’t good enough for her, but if she’s happy with another guy then why do I want her to be unhappy with me? And I just keep having this one thought of them sleeping together. And that won’t get out of my mind. It’s all I think about every time she tells me they’re hanging out. The thoughts don’t stop, so I drink, and when I drink I cut, and I don’t wanna cut anymore so I stopped drinking, and started scratching my fingers to the point it bleeds and scabs over, and it’s only when I get panic attacks, but I get panic attacks every time I think about her, because when I think about her I think about him, and when I do that I see them “together” and what if he’s better than? This is dumb I know because we broke up, but she’ll still call me when she gets off work, or answer when I call her, but she just tells me about the guy, or she could just be talking about anything...But I just see them, and we hang up, and I want to cut, but I don’t. I haven’t cut in about two weeks now, and it’s hard to get over her. Everyone has the one they let get away, and that was mine, and now I just regret not being there for her enough, I don’t know what else I could’ve done though, I only get so much vacation days, and I’m sorta broke all the time...And I want to do something for her but I can’t I just feel so alone and worthless all the time. I keep obsessing over the two of them together, and I just trigger my own panic attacks and I hate this. I wouldn’t actually commit suicide, but the thoughts have started surfacing again...And I know it’s not that I want to die, I just want not to feel this way, and I know it’ll happen in time, but these past few weeks I’ve stopped eating, I’ve stopped sleeping, I just have trouble focusing on things I’m smoking waaay more than I normally do, and I just need help. I can’t get obsessing over this.

Feeling empty,"It's not that I hate working but... no, it is precisely that I hate working. I just can't come to terms with the thought that I'm going to waste a huge part of my life doing things I don't like to do. 
For what? I don't see the point on working hard and achieving all these career goals if the only time I'm going to have to myself would be after I retire — IF I'm ever going to retire and not just drop dead in my 50/60s. 
I'm 27 and I have no idea how to live this life, my supposedly only chance at sentience. I'm depressed due to a lot of things: physical health problems, not being able to find a job that I'm going to at least tolerate, feeling generally lost in life.
I hated all the jobs I've been at, ALL OF THEM. It majorly contributed to my suicidal tendencies and I quit my last job with this awful premonition that if I'm not going to quit asap, I'm going to kill myself. 
My family doesn't understand because 'Everybody's gotta work for a living' (the usual), they kind of resent me now for being like this. I'd gladly drink all the Kool-Aid of this world and be a relatively happy working drone at this point in my life, but my mind just isnt wired that way.
I'm tired of constantly feeling depressed, guilty, angry at this world and myself. I feel absolutely alone, even thought I know that I'm not alone in this type of thinking.
Right now I just feel empty, like there's no way out of this, lile I have nothing to live for.

Need another perspective?,"I had a depressive episode so I moved back home, and have had depression for years but never confided in anyone. 

My parents are great and caring, and my mom is even a nurse, like 80% of the time they’re great.

But sometimes my mom can bug me.. like in the waiting room at the clinic while waiting to get recommended for a psychiatrist for depression she says: You still have it right?

Like what?! She has a nursing degree and asked that. I mean she’s usually very supportive but just this small thing makes me very confused. I am doing much better now that I have a routine and am not alone and suicidal everyday but just because you don’t see my depression doesn’t mean My depression went away.

I’ve hid it for at least 6 years and i was very good at it. I’m an actor. But it irks me that she would say that.

I’m 19 and sorta tall sometimes when we’re out shopping or something she talks about things that I’d rather not discuss in the middle of the mall, like “oh, yeah we should discuss when you should attend classes,” and we never discuss this at home.

It feels like she’s justifying my presence, like this is why I’m here with my 19 year old son on a Monday shopping and he’s not in school. Honestly it’s embarrassing and even if Im overthinking it I feel anxiety in public and I really don’t like standing out.

I’m pretty sure my depressions from her side of the family as she and her grandmother have had antidepressants. Don’t get me wrong we’re close and I love her, but sometimes it’s very annoying and any constructive criticism I give the way she responds is never in a way that doesn’t make me feel guilty about pointing something out.

Whenever there’s a problem she seems to blow it out of proportion, and I’ve stopped trying to help because if we go down a wrong street I become implicated in the problem and she makes it feel as if the world is ending even though everything works out. 

Sometimes it feels like she lets things go wrong on purpose, I can’t even count the times we have gone out for something and she forgot her bags, or we forgot to bring some package for the post office, or something similar. Whenever this happens she says “oh I should have thought of that” “I’m so stupid” “I should have known” and it makes me feel as if she is expecting me to remind her of these things. I appreciate all the things she does but if it’s something she organizes for example shopping like I have no control over what she forgets to bring but she somehow makes me feel responsible, or at least I do somehow. 

I just can’t understand this negative side to her and it seems like somethings always wrong and if it is she exacerbates it, I can’t tell if it’s from her depression if she has low self esteem and is hard on herself if she makes mistakes or makes mistakes on purpose, regardless it affects me.

I know not everything here was directly about depression but I thought because it relates to my situation might as well say what’s on my mind.

I've been having chronic pain and I'm partially blind,"Hi I'm 23 years old
It was October 2019,
I was having intense headaches and nausea, it was my birthday the 24th. My family thought it was normal because of my period 2 weeks go by the pain is worse and in tense. I was taken to a hospital, and a neurologist saw me and said I had no signs of any problems whatsoever but to make sure he prescribed me declofenac and to get a resonance on my head. 

No tumors where found and the declofenac made my problems worsen, I went to a different hospital where my grandmother sister works as head of emergency and pediatrician. The doctor who attended me stated I was fine and had nothing, I studied for a nursing license and knew the look in the doctors face when I told her I'm still in pain after administrating medication was of ""she just wants drugs"" face. I told my grandmas sister and she told me, that the doctor who attended me they always fight because of her attitude and insinuation on patients. At this time I was already 2 months in pain, my family tried to look for other know neurologist in the field to see what's going on and none of them knew.

3 months I was talking to a friend and just for a moment I felt numb, numb as in I didn't feel any pain. My dad got scared and saw my left eye drift away, he took me to a oftalmologist. He didn't know what's going on when he checked me so he referred me to a hospital specialized in neuro-oftalmologist. I went through the emergency room and I was obviously angry frustrated you name it. The doctor checked my eyes and told me I had papilledema, and it might be cause by the birth control pills since I was always having issues with my hormones. The blood pressured my eyes thus having nausea, headaches, desoroentation, sensitivity to light, and insomnia.

I was treated for papilledema and I can't use any birth control whatsoever, but now I'm still sensitive to light and I see like those huge TVs in the 90s and VHS. Because my left eye was left with nerve damage, I can't see my peripheral view from both my eyes. the left eye its been losing the blur I see and it's getting darker, as in pitch black and have like a 1cm of blurred or I think even less. I'm also not being able to see most colors or differentiate in deepness (as in stairs, steps, holes etc) 

It's been 6 months now..

I changed doctors, learned myself to go through my surroundings without depending in my eye sight. I no longer have papilledema and I still get headaches even when I try to force my eye sigth, plus In December we found out my knees is more above than usual and that's why it pops out. But that time it popped out it didn't went in and now I have to use kinesiology tape to have support and control over it.

I've been snapping at a lot of people degrading me, telling me it's nothing, people are in worse situations be grateful.

But I'm not allowed to snap, I'm not allowed to defend myself, I'm not allowed to call people out when they make me feel like I've literally gone through nothing.

I have no friends, and the people I know don't know my position. Because they literally don't give a sh*T

Im social whenever I can and this was my actual fear losing my eye sight. I'm not afraid of risking it, making hard decisions, animals, crisis. My fear is actually coming true..

How am I not going to feel depressed, sad, upset, angry, frustrated....

HOW?! I literally use the keyboard voice option instead of writing and Google assistant.

Everything I liked reading books, watching old movies, going to cons...

And the worse part is my son hides from me every time he gets because he already knows mommy can't see, so I freak out when I can't hear him or feel him in the house.

I'm just going to end it here, cuz me getting upset also makes my head hurt more than usual.",imnotscaredyouare,0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/fe1tja/ive_been_having_chronic_pain_and_im_partially/,hi 23 year old wa october 2019 wa intense headache nausea wa birthday 24th family thought wa normal period 2 week go pain worse tense wa taken hospital neurologist saw said sign problem whatsoever make sure prescribed declofenac get resonance head tumor found declofenac made problem worsen went different hospital grandmother sister work head emergency pediatrician doctor attended stated wa fine nothing studied nursing license knew look doctor face told still pain administrating medication wa want drug face told grandma sister told doctor attended always fight attitude insinuation patient time wa already 2 month pain family tried look know neurologist field see going none knew 3 month wa talking friend moment felt numb numb feel pain dad got scared saw left eye drift away took oftalmologist know going checked referred hospital specialized neuro oftalmologist went emergency room wa obviously angry frustrated name doctor checked eye told papilledema might cause birth control pill since wa always issue hormone blood pressured eye thus nausea headache desoroentation sensitivity light insomnia wa treated papilledema use birth control whatsoever still sensitive light see like huge tv 90 vhs left eye wa left nerve damage see peripheral view eye left eye losing blur see getting darker pitch black like 1cm blurred think even le also able see color differentiate deepness stair step hole etc 6 month changed doctor learned go surroundings without depending eye sight longer papilledema still get headache even try force eye sigth plus december found knee usual pop time popped went use kinesiology tape support control snapping lot people degrading telling nothing people worse situation grateful allowed snap allowed defend allowed call people make feel like literally gone nothing friend people know know position literally give sh im social whenever wa actual fear losing eye sight afraid risking making hard decision animal crisis fear actually coming true going feel depressed sad upset angry frustrated literally use keyboard voice option instead writing google assistant everything liked reading book watching old movie going con worse part son hide every time get already know mommy see freak hear feel house going end cuz getting upset also make head hurt usual,chronic pain partially blind,im scared

help- i need advice,"ive been having a horribly depressed episode for the past 6 months— i am not diagnosed but ive been dealing with casual symptoms of depression for my whole life (im 18).
i finally went to my doctor in january and she gave me a referral to a psychiatrist, but wait lists here are long and its been over a month and i havent heard anything. ill probably be waiting much longer and that thought feels like torture and makes me feel worse.
im self harming, but i personally dont think its at an alarming level. there was about a month long period when i was **actively** suicidal, had a plan, a date, and the tool to do it. obviously i didnt follow through. the thought of suicide still lingers in my mind but its more low-key now...
when i was actively suicidal i was considering voluntary hospitalization. i know that route would get me treatment much quicker.
right now i feel like thats my only option with my current situation... i dont know if this is selfish, but i cant bare the thought of waiting much longer for treatment when ive been having on and off depressive episodes my whole life, and i believe im in the middle of my worst one yet right now.

I HAVE A GUT FEELING THAT WONT GO AWAY.,"I really don’t have any evidence on this, but I have this feeling my GF cheated (or still is) on me. I have told her about this and we try different things to strengthen the trust again but nothing really works. This is ruining our relationship that was going great until this. It all started with me thinking that my friend and her were very friendly with each other, plus they shared a lot in common. That idea grew in my head at one point I had convinced myself it was true. I don’t know if it’s true or not I confronted both of them, but of course they denied it. Doesn’t help that my friend is always lying about things (small things at times) and after telling him the situation he hated me and began acting like a dick and showed me a side of him I never knew. I understand people will do and say things that they don’t mean when mad but he said some mean things lol. We ended up talking things out after I almost fought him because of the slimy shit he did.

In a pickle of feelings,"I've been in a very relaxed relationship since September but ever since january things have been ""on the wall."" During winter break, especially after the holidays, she became a lil bit distant to me. We eventually talked and she wanted to be apart for awhile due to personal issues with herself and I understood and we went from a relationship to just best friends. We have talked about her issues before so I told her I will always be there for her and she insisted she didnt want things to change or grow apart. We were in a very adult relationship so I didn't want to ruin or friendship, we eventually became close and things were all the same as they were before we broke up. Lately though she has been going through things again and I am having a hard time getting through it this time. Last time I took it very mature and was actually the only relationship I have actually not completely fallen apart after the break up. This time I'm thinking it's just me though and my own low self esteem has caused issues more than anything. I barely get a text from her and we never get to hang out and it really hurts, more than anything I have every felt before. This has resulted in me doing things I have never done before that I feel ashamed of, caused me to take up nicotine again, and major other issues resulting in my school work in college to be a burden rather than something to help me. Sorry I just needed to get some stuff off my chest and things and I hope she never sees any of this. She is an absolute gem and I want to be the one to be there for her as much as I can but I feel like she is hiding from me at times and doesnt want to even deal with me anymore. The only part that give me hope and joy is when I see her in class and we talk and joke, and then I kiss her good bye and I dont see her for another few days.

I need advice!,"Hi, so my friend has depression and an eating disorder of some kind. I had depression last year but got out of it and last time I selfharmed was maybe 6 months ago. I and the few people that know about her problems have tried to help her and it helped a little but got bad again. She was one of my bestfriends but she makes me depressed and anxious now and I can’t handel it. But none of the people that she has told can really help her anymore because we are too exhausted and can’t risk our own health. She won’t get professional help and 70% of what she talks about is her bad eating habits or selfharm/depression.

She’s always too close to me and I have said to her that I need my personal space but she doesn’t seem to understand. I want to help her but It’s just too much right now. When we talked about her needing professional help she said that she got professional help but it got too busy just before she could get better. She ment me, I was the ”professional” help. I have been busy so I haven’t talked to her outside of school that much and I just feel like she tried to make me feel bad that she almost got better and then I got busy. Like I can’t use all my free time on you, I have my own problems and life too. She doesn’t respect my boundaries and I feel like she has gotten between me and my bestfriends. I feel like I’m a bad friend but I have to choose my health first. I need some space from her but I can’t get any. I need advice! But remember, if you are depressed please get help and talk to someone, it truly helps. This is why professional help is so good, friends can help to some extent but they aren’t professionals that know how to handel these things in the best way. I just have it hard because I’m still healing and it’s not good for me right now personally.

Feeling below average,"This feeling comes and goes and I usually keep it suppressed by submerging myself in mundane stuff. I am 34 years old and I have been dealing with these episodes of worthlessness since probably middle school. I grew up in a small rural town in Puerto Rico. I can’t say we all know each other, but everyone knows everyone else’s business. 

I  grew up in a  strict pentecostal family with many rules forced into my siblings and I. We used to go to church usually 7 days a week and on Sundays twice (Bible school in the morning and afternoon/evening service).  Secular music was prohibited and any tv material that was deemed “demonic” by the pastor. 

Of course, living in a pentecostal family made a huge impact on who I was from elementary school all the way until I decided to part ways with the faith later on in my 20s. I was so insecure about myself and tried super hard to fit in with the other kids. It was a challenge because I never felt understood by the others, mainly because I had nothing to relate with them. I was not allowed to listen to secular music or even go to the movies because of rules my mom enforced on all of us. 

That insecurity grew even stronger when entered high school, which of course was the worse years of my teenage years. There were so many things happening in my life at that moment that I thought in some weird way it was all normal. 

During the last years of elementary school my dad decided to distance himself from church. He became an alcoholic shortly after and everything went downhill from there. He multiple affairs that my mom was ware of and that didn’t turned out well for me. My mom became aggressive and depressed. I used to get hit for no reason that I can remember to this day.

I think she felt trapped because divorcing my father was not an option due to her fanaticism. My mom used to break stuff every day, scream and yell, stayed inside her room all day and praying for the most part. One positive thing I can say about her is that we were never hungry and somehow she always found ways to provide us with clothes and food. 

My dad disappeared for many months one time and I thought he gave up on us but specially on me. I felt so betrayed by him. My mom was also non-present in my life or school. My grades dropped drastically and I was bullied a lot at school for being alone the majority of the time. 

There is so much to say about everything that happened but, I thought I was over that and everything that happened. Today I am angry at my parents because how irresponsible they were with their kids. I compare myself to every one else around me and I feel like I should’ve had a better upbringing. I know it’s up to me know and they are no longer responsible but it still hurts me so much. 

I deal with my insecurities every day and that is something I’m never gonna be able to change. I compare myself a lot with everyone.  I tend to feel like a way lesser version of whoever I am comparing myself to. I’m going to therapy and that helps to a degree. I just wish I could find people or at least someone that can relate to this.

I feel like my life is going no where,"And I don’t know where to begin
Words used to come naturally 
And now they feel dead. 

So I’m not going to try. 

I don’t know where my life is going and I don’t know why I am here. Things seem to be spinning out of control and I just don’t know how to stop things from moving. I got fired from my job for being sick, for being chronically ill. I’m doing the best I can, and being sick never effected my work performance. I belong in a hospital — but not as a patient. I am supposed to be a nurse now—I am 24. I was dead set on nursing school from the time I was a little girl. I’m supposed to be making little kids laugh as chemo flows into their veins. But no. I have a port a cath myself and nursing school seems so far away. I don’t know what I am doing. I don’t know what is going on in my relationship ship. I don’t know what is going on with my body. I go to the Mayo Clinic in two weeks so they can see what the fuck is wrong with me. I just feel like I have no control and I don’t know which way to turn. I’m trying my hardest to get through. I feel like I have no direction. Next week I don’t have any work lined up and then the week after I go to mayo. Alone. And I am starting to freak out. I mean I have traveled alone before, many times. But this is different. I am going to be poked and prodded and scanned and all of these things and I’m scared. And I will be alone. My boyfriend, who lives with me, but am now in an open relationship with and he came out as bisexual recently and we are slowly drifting apart so he can see what living life as a bi/gay man is like, will experience what it is like to be alone.

Turning 31 soon...is it worth trying to make something of myself?,"I'm almost 31 and a nurse. I own my own home in a capital city in Australia and have roughly 2/3 of the mortgage paid off. Despite these successes, I feel like a failure. I've pretty much lived my whole adult life in a way that is completely inauthentic to how I really feel inside. It's like I haven't let myself free in any way.

I always wanted to be a translator of Japanese, but I chose nursing because it was much more stable and I lacked confidence. In my early 20s I had an ED and I let guys use me for sex (I've only slept with 4 people but looking back I don't think I wanted to sleep with any of them). I used to have a nice slim figure but I've put on a few pounds from binge eating (not fat) and I'm working on losing it. I have pretty much no friends and don't really socialise outside work. I can't drive. I haven't had sex since I was 24. I've never had what you would call a proper, grown-up relationship.

I am thinking about learning a language in the hopes of changing career, but I feel like a total loser. Being 31, I feel like I'm 'over the hill' and there's no chance for me to become proficient in a skill or to succeed. I feel like no-one cares what I do, I could literally just live in my house with my cats getting fatter and fatter until I died. I seem to be obsessing over a guy who used me pretty badly at university who got married to a ballet dancer recently. I keep thinking, there's a quality woman, she's so talented, I'll never be talented like that. What's the point?

wish someone would bring me chinese food and stroke my hair while i cry,"i am feeling very, very bad right now. suicidal i guess. more like passively wishing i would slip into death with no effort or suffering on my part. i’ve suffered enough. 

i feel like right now is the first time all week my brain has had to pause and process or actually feel something and it’s just aggressively hitting me with all the depression i’ve been stuffing down throughout the week when i didn’t have time for it. well, now i do. so here it is. 

i tried journaling. i ended up just listing ways i could kill myself right now while i’m home alone. (not gonna. wish i would, or could, but i won’t. not now). tried meditating. couldn’t focus on it or let the calm penetrate the surface. i looked at my dog and immediately started sobbing, thinking about him living without me. 

i wanted to get some fresh air and let him run around, so i let him outside and sat on the front steps. he ended up sitting right next to me. wouldn’t leave my side. i looked up and saw the moon (it was still daylight) and began crying again. my dog kept nudging me to keep a hand on him and pushing against me. it made me cry more. i talked aloud to the moon. to whatever is out there. to my late mom. begged whoever was listening to please just help me. ease the pain. do something. i do not want to do this anymore. 

sat there for a while and watched the moon move in the sky behind the bare tree branches. felt the cold air seep down to my bones. it felt good. felt good to feel something that wasn’t sadness. it calmed me down. at this point i just feel numb. back to autopilot, i guess. better than life-shatteringly sad, right? 

i wish i could tell someone “i’m feeling suicidal” and they’d drop everything to bring me chinese food and rub my back. without me saying another word. that’s what i want. ridiculous, right? but instead i tell people that and then push them away. or i don’t tell them at all. or i give subtle hints and they are completely ignored. 

actually, i wish the aid of other people would help me at all. i THINK having someone support me in this way or love me or kiss my wounds would fix it all, but it wouldn’t. i’m just terrified of the thought of dealing with this alone for another single second. i am terrified of myself. of my brain. of my sickness. my trauma. my darkness. i want someone else to come pick up all the pieces and feed me chinese food and rub my back while they do it. 

if only.

Was I depressed?,"In 2014, I first entered university and encountered a lot of changes: new people, new environment, new classes, and so on.

At the time, I had a lot of acne, which prevented me from meeting people. Furthermore, I had an identity crisis and started asking fundamental questions of life such as: ""who am I? why am I here? where do I go?"", and constantly thought about life and death. I wanted to harm myself and other people because I was in such a lonely, miserable spot when everyone else looked so happy. This lasted a few months. 

In between, I picked up lifting weights, practiced meditation, and my acne cleared up. 

Fast forward 5 years, I am completely happy. I have good friends, a good relationship with my family, and I have a stable career. Since my environment improved, my negative thoughts subsided. But I know that depressions don't go away with time, and that's what I'm worried about.

Depression and the people who treat it,"I have to get this off my chest or I’m going to go off on someone. So as you can read back through my posts, I was doing Spravato for a very short time before my insurance pulled the rug out from me. Two weeks into it, that’s right - TWO WEEKS, Insurance comes back after pre-approving my treatment and says since I had not shown a 50% improvement they were denying any further treatments. Thanks for the warning fuckers! So of course my depression and anxiety dropped severely after this happened. Partly because of being pissed and irate and outright shocked about how they could even do this. And second, my body and mind didn’t care for how I just suddenly stopped treatments. So I’ve been on a downward spiral for about two weeks now. 
Well the clinic where I was having the treatments has not really got back to me and kind of dropped me like a bad habit now that they aren’t getting money from my insurance. When the lady called to tell me she said she would talk to the dr in charge of the program and ask him what he wanted to do. That was almost two weeks ago. I’ve spoke to her once since and tried calling several times with no call back. Like seriously ... What the fuck? You have someone who was telling you I was severely depressed and suicidal (enough to get approved for disability - which is not easy to do!) and you’re just gonna fucking ignore my calls and my concerns and let me go to the wayside? What happened to checking with the dr to ask him about a next step? Is that it? Is it just like - well no more Spravato for you so we are done dealing with you?! I’m fed the fuck up quite honestly. And after waiting all week since talking to her Monday, I’m going to call tomorrow and I’m asking to speak to a supervisor or someone in charge of that fucking place. Let me just add also that when I first contacted them to set up my initial appointment, it took almost two months before I got in there! That’s right! Two months! It was the beginning of December when I first called and someone was supposed to call me back and I waited and waited and finally called and went off asking them “do I have to say I’m suicidal before someone will take me seriously and call me back??” It was soon after I finally got in there but to me that’s a little ridiculous to think of making a suicidal person wait almost two months to start treatment or be evaluated. 
Between that and the insurance screwing me, I’m truly and utterly fed up. It makes me sick and pissed off how the system fails people like me and then they wonder why mental illness is such an issue and has such a stigma around it! Well no fucking wonder. If others are treated anything like I have been, and I have a feeling that many are, then I can see why people lose their shit and either end up killing them selves or others. Let me clarify - I’m NOT in any way condoning that behavior or saying it’s okay. I’m simply saying that it’s no wonder there’s such an issue with mental illness in this county. 
All that being said, where does one go from here? I’ve tried therapists, countless medicines, obviously the Spravato - all to come to this. To pretty much be treated as if my life means nothing and completely and utterly ignored! I hate to sound narcissistic, but god damn. My life should be just as important as anyone else’s. 
Here’s the conclusion I’ve pretty much come to in the last 24 hours. I have to stop depending on anyone to help me deal with this fucking sickness. I have to depend on myself to somehow get better. I am the only one who is here for me. Nobody else gives a fuck. Nobody. Why should they? They have nothing invested in me and I mean nothing. If they aren’t getting money from insurance then why bother even returning my phone call right? 
I don’t know. If this is what our society has come to, I seriously want no part of it anymore. It’s disgusting and I am to the point where I hate people in general. I know that sounds bad, but go back up and re-read my post if you really want to try to understand why I am starting to hate people. I wasn’t always this way. Yes, I’ve dealt with mental illness most my life in some capacity or another. But here in the last 5 years it has hit the absolute bottom of the bottom. I look back at times when I thought I was depressed before and I think to myself - I’d give anything to go back to that time and redo things. 
I don’t really have anything else to say. I’ve rambled on enough. I just had to get this all out in some way. If you made it to this and have read my whole post then thank you. You’ve shown more concern than the people who claimed to be there for me and deal with my depression - until the insurance money stopped coming.",fairysparkles333,0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/fe6svr/depression_and_the_people_who_treat_it/,get chest going go someone read back post wa spravato short time insurance pulled rug two week right two week insurance come back pre approving treatment say since shown 50 improvement denying treatment thanks warning fucker course depression anxiety dropped severely happened partly pissed irate outright shocked could even second body mind care suddenly stopped treatment downward spiral two week well clinic wa treatment ha really got back kind dropped like bad habit getting money insurance lady called tell said would talk dr charge program ask wanted wa almost two week ago spoke since tried calling several time call back like seriously fuck someone wa telling wa severely depressed suicidal enough get approved disability easy gonna fucking ignore call concern let go wayside happened checking dr ask next step like well spravato done dealing fed fuck quite honestly waiting week since talking monday going call tomorrow asking speak supervisor someone charge fucking place let add also first contacted set initial appointment took almost two month got right two month wa beginning december first called someone wa supposed call back waited waited finally called went asking say suicidal someone take seriously call back wa soon finally got little ridiculous think making suicidal person wait almost two month start treatment evaluated insurance screwing truly utterly fed make sick pissed system fails people like wonder mental illness issue ha stigma around well fucking wonder others treated anything like feeling many see people lose shit either end killing self others let clarify way condoning behavior saying okay simply saying wonder issue mental illness county said doe one go tried therapist countless medicine obviously spravato come pretty much treated life mean nothing completely utterly ignored hate sound narcissistic god damn life important anyone else conclusion pretty much come last 24 hour stop depending anyone help deal fucking sickness depend somehow get better one nobody else give fuck nobody nothing invested mean nothing getting money insurance bother even returning phone call right know society ha come seriously want part anymore disgusting point hate people general know sound bad go back read post really want try understand starting hate people always way yes dealt mental illness life capacity another last 5 year ha hit absolute bottom bottom look back time thought wa depressed think give anything go back time redo thing really anything else say rambled enough get way made read whole post thank shown concern people claimed deal depression insurance money stopped coming,depression people treat,fairy sparkle 333
Does anyone else feel alone even when surrounded by people?,"Things that didn't bother me in the past are now sending me into a deep depression. You know when you're talking to someone about something you're passionate about, but they just dont care? You know when that seems to happen with every interest and every person? Thats happening to me constantly lately. I guess it always did but I didnt think about it so hard in the past. Now it just makes me feel so alone. I can be talking and bubbly and I mention an interest and the person i'm talking to just nods in feign interest. If its over text its just stuff like ""wow"",  ""nice"",  ""lol"",  ""cool"". You can just tell they arent interested because as soon as the topic changes they are so much more involved. Honestly its making me feel so bitter, it feels like no one cares enough to try and get involved with the interests which mean the most to me. I can be surrounded by people but I feel so alone because I know no one cares. I know no one cares about me. No one cares about my interests. Honestly its just gotten really sad. Out of context this can sound so selfish but I just compare it to myself - when I know someone I love is deeply interested in something I try my hardest to see what they see when they look at it.

Can't Trust My Girrlfriend When I'm Depressed,"Hello all, 

Using a throwaway account, but I frequent this sub on my main account. Anyway, I need some advice. I can't trust my girlfriend when I'm depressed. The both of us deal with anxiety and depression, but she doesnt seem to get me when I'm depressed. Don't get me wrong, we both have our faults, but we always do our best to understand each other and walk through hard times with one another. However,  the last two times that I have been very depressed, she ended up pushing me away when I needed her the most. About a month ago she got very upset with me that she walked over to me and angrily accused me of not showing enough attention to our relationship. I had a family member pass just a few weeks before, and I think it was finally getting to me. I apologized, told her that I'm depressed, saying that I wish I could be doing better. I told her that I was depressed and she walked away, angry, slamming the door behind her. The person that I love the most turned her back on me when I needed her the most. I went for a walk, we messaged each other, and she asked me to come back. She was crying so much, I felt bad. She felt terrible for not listening to me. This wasn't the first time that something like this has happened though. When I am depressed, she pushes me away. Besides this, my girlfriend is incredibly loving, thoughtful, creative in our relationship, and sacrifices so much for us. But this, this hurts so fucking bad. 

Reddit, have you experienced something similar? Where do you turn when you're depressed? Have you talked to your SO about this and have you fixed it?

"I was dead years ago, I'm just catching up","I give up.  I have been over life since I was a teenager and I'm not doing a good enough job hiding it anymore.  My boss even pulled me aside with concerns. 


""When I was interviewing you you had the best interview I'd ever seen. Where is that guy? You miss work, you're emotional, you have lost all your passion"" 

My mother can't even talk to me without me going into tears over being the worst son ever. She hasn't said anything to that effect but does notes that I'm not eating. Not doing anything anymore. When I'm off work I end up spending hours just staring at the walls and I'll find myself crying although I don't know what for. She doesn't visit my home as often anymore.

I feel like I'm starting to slip and it's too much. When I could hide it it was fine because I didn't have to explain anything to anyone, but having people ask me directly why I'm malnourished and lost a lot of weight is leading to outbursts I can't control anymore.  

I was keeping it together pretty well for about 30 years but in the last 2 years my entire friend groupEnded up moving away or finding their own lives all at about the same timeAnd since then I've not really had any contact With other people outside of work 
. I'm glad I was able to keep it together until everyone found their own happiness so I avoided being a burden to them. so I feel like it's as good a time as any to have me just quietly disappear
 I don't know how to tell everybody that the guy that they thought they knew was an act and never existed in the 1st place. I feel darker and darker thoughts more and more often lately and I would honestly be terrified to actually hurt somebody else. And I guess I just wish that there was some safe in easy way out of life because I don't really deserve it.  

Who could possibly go through another 30 years of this shit? How is it that I am the crazy one for not wanting that? 

When people have used up all they had it's less ethical to make those people stay alive than to let us go.",melancholia5280,1,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/fe3hun/i_was_dead_years_ago_im_just_catching_up/,give life since wa teenager good enough job hiding anymore bos even pulled aside concern wa interviewing best interview ever seen guy miss work emotional lost passion mother even talk without going tear worst son ever said anything effect doe note eating anything anymore work end spending hour staring wall find cry although know visit home often anymore feel like starting slip much could hide wa fine explain anything anyone people ask directly malnourished lost lot weight leading outburst control anymore wa keeping together pretty well 30 year last 2 year entire friend groupended moving away finding life timeand since really contact people outside work glad wa able keep together everyone found happiness avoided burden feel like good time quietly disappear know tell everybody guy thought knew wa act never existed 1st place feel darker darker thought often lately would honestly terrified actually hurt somebody else guess wish wa safe easy way life really deserve could possibly go another 30 year shit crazy one wanting people used le ethical make people stay alive let u go,wa dead year ago catching,melancholia 5280
Identity and being suicidal,"My problem started about 4 years ago.  Generally, I am a calm person - an introvert (more ambivalent), I liked being with myself, I liked to help, I was quite specific, very empathetic, although I stayed with other normal cool people.  I couldn't be a dick.
 Over time, I noticed that I stand out.  Others went somewhere, spent time, etc. Problems started in high school when it came to partying, crazy outings.  Everyone snapped, told their exits as if it was unknown.  And I didn't have anyone but one friend.  I found that something was wrong with me and I began to change.  I wanted to reprogram, upload other more extroverted software.  At that time I had a completely distorted picture of reality.  And for example - I have always been balanced and did not make quick, ill-considered decisions.  Seeing that others don't do it, I suppressed it and added it to my new ""software"".  Seeing that others do not respond immediately to the huts also so began to do.  These small, seemingly low risk examples have changed me.  There were plenty of them.  I did so with everything.  I know it's sick but it was so.  I began to think what other people's lives were like.  I wanted to experience these beautiful moments that I heard and told them myself.  It lasted a long time.  My current personality was changed.  I copied every behavior and thinking patterns of the ""better"" ones I took an example of. After half a year, I got depressed. I felt terrible. Memory loss, pits. I realized what I had done and wanted to unprogram. I began to think, I analyzed my personality a lot  , what should change, how to behave and feel. I tried to remember my previous identity. I had so many copied habits that I didn't know how to behave, feel, think. I didn't feel like myself, as if unreal, in a dream, without contact  with feelings, emotions.
 The situation continues to this day.  I do not know who I am.  I don't feel anything, I don't feel myself.
 The only thing keeping me alive is the awareness that it used to be good and it's all in my head.  I often have thoughts of suicide.
 I have sick thoughts - I classify people according to their qualities that are useful and not, I divide people into better and worse.  I do not feel anything.
 Not once during these 4 years did I feel alive.  No sadness, no shot of joy, no intense feeling.
 He constantly compares himself to others.  I do not know how to be myself - I look at others, I wonder what they feel, how they think, what chances I would face against them.  The psychologist and therapy did nothing.  Now he keeps in touch with a psychologist who tells me to stop thinking and follow my feelings
 I try to do it but I still want to write it.  I feel lost.  The only thing keeping me alive is reason.  Nothing else.  He tells me he thinks it all.  I don't remember what it's like to be happy.  I do not know who I am.

Beauty and the Beast but I'm the Beast?,"My partner is the most happy, positive, loving person in the world. I have never met anyone like him, he's so special and he makes me feel things I've never felt before. But it kills me how much shit I put him through all the time. He sees me when I'm depressed and it hurts him, and I lash out on him because I'm not feeling well and I have mood swings. And somehow it bothers me even more that he doesn't mind, he doesn't get offended or angry, I could be absolutely horrible to him and he would just show me endless love and try to comfort me and reassure me he's where he wants to be.

I know I should be happy, but it bothers me so much. I'm constantly tormented by feeling like an awful person for doing mean things to someone so amazing. A little voice in my head never stops telling me he deserves better and I would be doing him a favour if I broke up with him. Yeah, he would be hurt for a little while, but he'd get over me and then he could find someone who treats him the way he should be treated. I wish I could treat him right but I feel like I have no control over my mood swings.

There's also a selfish part of me that thinks I would feel better if I broke up with him and didn't have to feel so guilty all the time. I feel like I'm going to end up ruining him, he's so positive and he brightens up every room he's in, but what if my sadness rubs off on him? I'd be hurt too if we split up but I deserve that, he doesn't deserve a monster like me.

That's it, I just kind of wanted to get this off my chest.

I no longer fear death as much as I used to due to not enjoying life,"I used to fear death and have hypochondria. I guess I loved life so much that the prospect of losing it all was terrifying.

I have to let him go.,"Our relationship was the best up until the 19th of February. I let my insecurities, fears and depression get me and I overwhelmed him. I drove him away and now it feels like we dont know each other. all our conversations are one sided. I haven't seen him for weeks except for the two times I asked to talk to him. I'm in a worse state and the only way I can win him back is to get stronger but I cant. every day I come home, lay on my bed, stare at the wall, cry and remember this all my fault. He's a good person and he doesn't deserve someone ruining his happiness. today I'm preparing myself to let him go. I love him with all my heart but I cant stand it anymore. I want to get stronger but I just cant. All my friends dont know about it because I dont want to overwhelm them like how I did with him. Again, I felt alone. And I hated it. Why couldnt I be happy like 2 months ago? Why did this sadness come back? This is much stronger than what I felt for the past 11 years. Buy when the day comes where we part. I dont think I'll ever truly be myself. I made myself worse. And I just let it happen.  I keep making myself worse. I hate myself for that.

Went to a psychiatrist,"This morning my mom took me to a psychiatrist appointment I’ve been waiting for for months. Immediately, he began questioning why I was there when I had good grades in school and seemed fine. Also asked if I was restless all the time and I said yes, and he told me no I wasn’t because I wasn’t fidgeting at that point (even though I was shaking and playing with my Kleenex) Then my mom mentioned the eating disorder clinic I’ve been going to and he asked my bmi and I’m not allowed to know it, so he made me stand up and started patting me down to get a “feel for my weight”. By this point I was crying and he just continued to make me feel like I was faking it or shouldn’t be there. It took me 6 years to speak up about this and now I’m regretting it because I always feared I would be told that I was overreacting or faking it. Was uncomfortable the whole time too because he was sitting with like less than a metre between us and. I have to go see him again in a few weeks and I’m so terrified, I’m still crying and it’s been 3 hours.

Do I even want help?,"I reached out yesterday... I called 111. I needed to. But now, am I glad I did or do I regret it?

 Depression at varying degrees has been my state of existence for so long, I don't know who I am without it. Yes, I have good times that are not as bad... But they are short-lived. Fleeting.

I last had medical help a few years ago. Therapy and meds helped. Therapy ended... Then I missed an appointment for a med check and I don't reschedule when that happens... I don't want to waste anyone's time.

My state was tolerable. Manageable. I stopped self harming more than a year and a half ago. I'm proud of that, even if that long stretch came from a bad relapse... I don't want to ruin it now. I really don't.

The thing is, my mental state has been deteriorating over the past few months... Year? More? I don't even know... Occasional thoughts of hurting myself I can ignore and move on from. But they, like the happy times, are usually fleeting. As are worse thoughts. Now... It's persistent. And fighting it is exhausting. Reached a point yesterday where I honestly did not feel safe. So I called. 111 put me onto the rapid response team. Had a meeting today. Have a doctor's appointment tomorrow. Have to see them ever day for a little under two weeks.

But that doesn't stop the thoughts... I feel guilty because I feel like I'm taking valuable resources away from someone else who needs them. But I'm also worried... I lose chunks of time... My memory is crap and I can forget things minutes later sometimes (it's intermittent)... I have no energy or drive to do... Anything... I can't focus on conversations and constantly have to ask people to repeat themselves. I've been getting persistent chest pains and my vision is just... Weird. I can't explain completely. And I'm constantly fighting the need to do... Something. I need to hurt. But I can't let myself. And it's exhausting.

So all these strategies coming in and I keep asking myself... I don't even want help. Or do I? I don't know. I know I reached out and I know I can't keep doing this without professional help. My SO also can't keep up with this... He isn't a professional and it's so unfair to him. I want to be better for him as well as... I just want to be normal... To function. But all this outside help. It feels like too much, too fast... It would be easier to just... Not...

I've finally accepted that I'm a fucking failure.,"I'm at my 3rd job in my field out of grad. The first lasted 3 months before they told me it wasn't working out, the second lasted 7 months before they told me I was slipping, and this one just ended today with a phone call at a mere 2 months. I don't know if I can make myself go on. I don't know where else to go, my skills weren't good enough, and it was a specialized field. I was too quiet for something too client-oriented and it translated to having terrible communication skills that I can't get over. My peers are all going to hear about this, it's a small field and you tend to see everyone in the same industry at conferences, two of them worked at that first job and are heavy gossipers and they'll probably tell everyone there what happened and they'll feel that happy schadenfreude that I was a fucking failure, another piece of conversation fodder to laugh about. I have my other classmates on social media and they post about how great it is to be in that field, and some of them share the same interests as I do so I'll likely run into them again at fan-related events. They say that you shouldn't care about what other people think but easier said than done. I can't face them again and I can't face myself either. The only thing keeping me alive is the fact that the options I've run through in my brain haven't been ideal, painless or with a high success rate as well as my cowardice so I guess I'll still be miserably alive until I find something suitable.",niricia,0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/fe63p8/ive_finally_accepted_that_im_a_fucking_failure/,3rd job field grad first lasted 3 month told working second lasted 7 month told wa slipping one ended today phone call mere 2 month know make go know else go skill good enough wa specialized field wa quiet something client oriented translated terrible communication skill get peer going hear small field tend see everyone industry conference two worked first job heavy gossiper probably tell everyone happened feel happy schadenfreude wa fucking failure another piece conversation fodder laugh classmate social medium post great field share interest likely run fan related event say care people think easier said done face face either thing keeping alive fact option run brain ideal painless high success rate well cowardice guess still miserably alive find something suitable,finally accepted fucking failure,nir ici
I’m having a lot of trouble accepting my self sexually and being happy,"have been feeling incredibly self conscious, depressed and terrible about my own self and my self as a sexual being. I constantly compare myself sexually with other partners my s/o has had Bc she will talk about them (not trying to hurt me) but I am so extremely self conscious that I can’t even masturbate. It’s enough to ruin my day sometimes and even bleed into other parts of my life and relationships. I feel so terribly low that I don’t feel the love from my s/o even though she tries her hardest. I love her and want to propose but I can’t do that right now Bc of how im feeling. I want to feel loved and not so bad about myself.

My dog just pulled me out of a funk,"Hi guys. I've been struggling with a relapse into severe depression for the last couple of months. I've been seeing a psychiatrist who has changed me onto new meds, and I'm slowly starting to come good, but the last couple of days I've been in a deep funk, just not interested in doing anything, not eating, barely talking. I've spent most of my time in bed, or watching youtube, or both. I don't know if it's the change in meds (probably) or what, but I wanted to share a ridiculous moment I just had. 

My dog (a 5yo kelpie named Max) walked into my room, and nudged his butt against my knee like he does when he wants pats. I wasn't feeling it, and nudged him away. He came back, sat down on my foot, and let rip with a huge fart. Right on my foot. I started laughing - I haven't laughed in the last couple of days - and I kept laughing for a solid five minutes. I opened the window to clear the air (also haven't opened the window in the last couple of days) and all of a sudden the funk was over. It was like he poured cold water over my head and my vision cleared. I'm sitting at my desk in the fresh air, still smiling, and about to start on some uni work I have to get a jump on.  Max is napping on my bed like the champion he is.

Things can be so dark for so long that it can be hard to imagine anything different. I don't know what your version of your dog farting on your foot is, but when it comes, try to let it pull you out of the funk. I'm not well yet, and probably won't be back to normal for another month or so, but I'm getting there.",clairewil,0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/fe5zer/my_dog_just_pulled_me_out_of_a_funk/,hi guy struggling relapse severe depression last couple month seeing psychiatrist ha changed onto new med slowly starting come good last couple day deep funk interested anything eating barely talking spent time bed watching youtube know change med probably wanted share ridiculous moment dog 5yo kelpie named max walked room nudged butt knee like doe want pat feeling nudged away came back sat foot let rip huge fart right foot started laughing laughed last couple day kept laughing solid five minute opened window clear air also opened window last couple day sudden funk wa wa like poured cold water head vision cleared sitting desk fresh air still smiling start uni work get jump max napping bed like champion thing dark long hard imagine anything different know version dog farting foot come try let pull funk well yet probably back normal another month getting,dog pulled funk,claire wil

Totally burned out and extrem depressed,"So im going to tell you a „little“ about my Situation. I am usually a pretty happy Person. I like doing fun Things like going out with Friends who ive known pretty much all my life (im 23 ) and i have a passion which Is Film making. But Since i started with school even at a Young age i always had Problems concentrating and focusing at School it just isnt for me because I don’t see the benefits from it. I also think the school system is extremly outdated. Last September I started my education ( I live in Germany and the English word for ausbildung translates to education.. ) I work in a world known firm which im not going to name because of a couple of reasons which aren’t related to my problem though. I would say it’s pretty fun because all of my co workers and bosses are pretty nice and always want me to succeed and do good. I’m also pretty good at this job. Even though I got a lot for me going in this particular job I don’t really see me self working in this job for the rest of my life. I’d rather make a living doing films. But I could imagine working for a few years while working for my dream and that’s not a problem. But school is a major problem for me (in Germany you have to go to school while being in Vocational training, another word for the German word Ausbildung) it’s not that easy and I am literally crying everyday that I come from school ( School is 2 times a week ) I can’t concentrate well in school and I miss a lot of school material while trying to focus on a topic. When I have to write an exam I become depressed as f*ck from Studying. Everytime I Imagine working or having school I have suicidal thoughts and can’t get out of my bed for days sometimes. These thoughts are sometimes so bad, I imagine myself to end it all.. I also have a girlfriend which is my biggest supporter and the best human you could ever imagine. She gives everything trying to cheer me up and help me with my problems while working a 9 to 5 job. We want to marry and this is why I even got this job. Because of cultural reasons her family won’t let her get married unless her future husband gets a “secured” Vocational training in case something happens in life that I have something to fall back on. Me and her have the same outlook on this “cultured” living, it’s f*ckin stupid. I can understand her parents as well but it’s just that I am at a totally burned out point in my life that I can’t get motivated to finish this all. I don’t know what I can do to make my life easier.",[deleted],0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/fe0no3/totally_burned_out_and_extrem_depressed/,im going tell little situation usually pretty happy person like fun thing like going friend ive known pretty much life im 23 passion film making since started school even young age always problem concentrating focusing school isnt see benefit also think school system extremly outdated last september started education live germany english word ausbildung translates education work world known firm im going name couple reason related problem though would say pretty fun co worker boss pretty nice always want succeed good also pretty good job even though got lot going particular job really see self working job rest life rather make living film could imagine working year working dream problem school major problem germany go school vocational training another word german word ausbildung easy literally cry everyday come school school 2 time week concentrate well school miss lot school material trying focus topic write exam become depressed f ck studying everytime imagine working school suicidal thought get bed day sometimes thought sometimes bad imagine end also girlfriend biggest supporter best human could ever imagine give everything trying cheer help problem working 9 5 job want marry even got job cultural reason family let get married unless future husband get secured vocational training case something happens life something fall back outlook cultured living f ckin stupid understand parent well totally burned point life get motivated finish know make life easier,totally burned extrem depressed,deleted
"Days Like Today are the Days I wonder what the point is to carry on... :,(","I didn't sleep for shit again last night. Since I started taking Cymbalta, I have been having insomnia, even when I take melatonin. I miss sleep so much. Restful sleep... and my sex drive... thats just fucking gone. 

Work sucked so much today. One of the managers has an axe to grind with me it seems like and questioned what I was doing. I have been working for this company for almost four years and I know what I am doing. Then when I answered him he went and followed up with the other person to make sure I was telling the truth. I have never been dishonest with anyone at work so that really pissed me off and hurt my feelings. I am so tired of not being trusted. I once got accused of stealing $5k at a credit union I worked at long ago. I was never charged because I didn't do it and they couldn't prove it. I didn't do it and I don't know if they ever found out who did but it caused me a lot of hurt and grief. It is one of the worst feelings having everyone think you are something, like a theif, when you are far from it. I am still trying to lose that 50 pounds I gained from that bout of depression. I think my managers bullshit today stirred that shit up. 

I am simply exisiting today. I hurt everywhere. I dont feel like there really is any point to life anymore. I havent been happy for a long time. Ive tried medication. Ive been staying active om top of my already incredibly phyiscal job (i work in a warehouse). I dont have many friends anymore... my family is super negative.... im very much just going through the  motions and i ak so tired of it. I dont know how to be happy anymore. :,(",boopedya,3,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/fe2m8p/days_like_today_are_the_days_i_wonder_what_the/,sleep shit last night since started taking cymbalta insomnia even take melatonin miss sleep much restful sleep sex drive thats fucking gone work sucked much today one manager ha axe grind seems like questioned wa working company almost four year know answered went followed person make sure wa telling truth never dishonest anyone work really pissed hurt feeling tired trusted got accused stealing 5k credit union worked long ago wa never charged prove know ever found caused lot hurt grief one worst feeling everyone think something like theif far still trying lose 50 pound gained bout depression think manager bullshit today stirred shit simply exisiting today hurt everywhere dont feel like really point life anymore havent happy long time ive tried medication ive staying active om top already incredibly phyiscal job work warehouse dont many friend anymore family super negative im much going motion ak tired dont know happy anymore,day like today day wonder point carry,boo pedy
Maybe its for the best that I don't live anymore,"I am almost 40, on disability morbidly obese and can't lose weight no matter how hard I try.   I am almost 40, with nothing but a 500 dollar laptop that my neighbor gave me that is falling apart and only worth around 70 if that. a pair of shoes that are falling apart and hurt when I walk in them. about a dozen worn-out socks and a few shirts and pants all black. mostly sweat pants and two pairs of blue jeans and a worn-out wallet that is falling apart on me. 

I am on disability getting less than 800$ USD a month and have no educational background no GED was homeless for over 8 years and have bad teeth because of it. some need fixing and one needs a new crown. I wasn't taught dental hygiene until I became homeless and even then brushing and flossing was the least of my worries. it was more of getting food and trying to survive. 

I spent the past few years trying to get my GED and failed even with tutors and teachers and study groups found out I have learning issues that make it hard for me to get my GED and I basically have to go from the 2nd and 3rd grade to 12th grade in every subject.

I have no family, no friends. I am utterly alone in this world. Bought a car two years ago was my first car and was planning on living in it but got scammed out of 3k. been trying to save again for another car to live in but been unable to. 

Renting a bedroom from an elderly woman with bad health and she is going in for surgery today if she doesn't make it I will be homeless again nowhere to live and unable to survive being homeless this time. My body has arthritis in my lower back, rheumatoid arthritis in my knees and feet. there's days that I just can't get out of bed because of it hurting so badly. there is no way I can survive being on the streets again.

I feel like complete and utter crap especially compared to everyone else and now realizing how worthless I am in life and maybe it is for the best I just don't live anymore. I have nothing in this world to live for other than myself and even then I don't care to do that anymore. nothing in my life will get better. 

I applied for HUD housing and was supposed to move into my own apartment after 7 years of waiting on the list for over 40 hud housing I got accepted to one but I couldn't make it there as I had no money to get there or for first months rent, downpayment, or to have the lights turned on. 

I spent the past ten years trying to better my life but only to get knocked down every time I get up. For example. saved 3 to 4 years up to 3k and bought my first car then got scammed by the dealership. Resaved money up to 900 dollars then needed two teeth pulled which cost 450 each after tax which drained my 900 I had saved last month after almost a year of saving. Then I got called up for my first apartment ever and couldn't get there. 

Two years ago needed eye surgery to remove a cataract in my right eye and now need it done in my left eye but the Dr refuses and now Texas is doing this Real ID stuff where you need a star on your driver license and in order to do that I need an eye exam and I will most likely fail it and lose my driver license because of the cataract in my left eye so there goes the driver license and there goes getting a car to live in. 

Spent years trying to get my GED only to fail it every time I try. spent the past eight years in the dating scene only to get rejected by women over my weight and told I am worthless and have nothing to offer a relationship or just downright mocked at and laughed at over my weight.

I got the cataracts in my eyes from taking Androgel testosterone medication because I have very low testosterone and I am on thyroid meds because my thyroid is basically dead and when they gave the max dose I lost 45 lbs in 8 months with absolutely no changes to my diet or daily routine but then gained it back a year later..

I just literally can't take anymore of this crummy life and to the point of thinking death is a lot better than this and it is better to be dead than keep failing or being knocked down every time I try to do something with my life. 

I also suffer from CPTSD = Complex post traumatic Stress Disorder. I didn't serve just from things I been through in my life and childhood. I also suffer from Severe chronic depression, Severe social anxiety, severe abandonment issues, paranoia and learning issues. I have been diagnosed with them all. 

I have looked up issues with autism and self diagnosing that I may be borderline autistic as I have some of the same issues in that spectrum.

I recognize this ought to vary with each person and each scenario, though I wonder about responses that have made things better, easier, made you feel understood, or responses that were absolutely unhelpful.

35(F) suffer from clinical depression. I feel trapped in my 9 year relationship.,"Hi, I wasn't sure where to post this since it relates to a relationship. I've dealt with depression since my early teen's. It continued to be a major problem in my life until about my mid 20s when I met my current partner. Because of how emotionally mature, supportive and trusting he was, I felt my espisodes we not as frequent or as severe. However as I began to hit my 30s, I started to notice the larger issues that I overlooked when I was younger as not important, like his finanical health (how he views money/saving). He holds a job with little responsibility and low-stress but pays as such (i.e. near minimum wage). He did work overtime for a time to afford a house, which he has but needs me to pay half the mortgage in order to afford it. He says I'm the love of his life but he's not interested in getting married. He's also almost nearly a decade older than me.

I feel trapped because as much as I love him, I want to leave. The major reasons I want to leave are different views towards finances, marriage and moving (he doesn't want to move away from where his parents live). I've been wanting to leave for a very long time but I'm also scared. This decision has caused my anxiety then depression to spring up full force, comptemplating suicide because I'd rather die than live on my own. I haven't lived on my own since my early 20s and every time I lived alone it would result in me being suicidal nearly every day. I struggled, graduated late in college and managed a business degree that did nothing, but earn me an unstable job history and act as a cover to people that I'm doing okay. I just realize how emotionally dependent I am on him and that scares me too. I have no family or friends to talk to about this or for any emotional support. I also hate the state I live in as there are many bad memories here of past abuse. My parents also live here and our relationship remains strained.

What I want is to move out of this city and start over but I don't know if that's my depression talking or what. I don't trust my own decisions or judgements. I have low esteem for myself and my choices. Back to the reasons for leaving my partner though---I feel like who am I to say what I want in a relationship since for instance, I can't even hold a steady job so again, makes it hard to leave him. I'm also currently in school again to once more try a job more suitable to my personality--massage. Until then, I'm stuck living with him for another 6 months.

How do you find the courage to live on your own? Past that, how do you find the will or care to live? I don't have anyone. I mean, I won't have anyone if I leave him and that scares me into staying with him too. Or should I just stay with him and work things out? I'm not sure. I just know I can't sleep well, don't eat much and been crying every other day. Sometimes I just would rather die than have to make a life decision...

I’m losing myself.,"I can’t keep going.

I try and try to be a good person and every time I turn around the world takes something from me. I can’t afford to live anymore. The state of the world makes me sick. My family is so splintered. I lost my dad and my mother is so beyond done dealing with my messed up self it makes my chest hurt.

I never wanted to be this. I wanted to make my family’s life better but here I am a failed 38 year old man who can’t even support himself let alone help those I love.

I don’t know where to turn. Doctors push so many drugs on me and I feel like I can not even think because of it therapy just wants me to blame my father and I do t want to do that, I loved him and he loved me. 

I hate myself and who I have become. I want a normal life. I want to support myself and help my loved ones. I was the rock and now I’m just a pile of shit.

I can’t do this. I hate it, I hate me. I do not remember a time when my chest did not hurt from this. I’m so tired. I want to love someone, I want to be better. I’m going to die like this and I can’t stand the thought.

How can I legally die? I just want to stop being the burden. People will forget me quickly, I provide nothing to this world. 

I’ve never kissed a woman. I’m a damn loser.

I can’t even imagine having a child because I would never want this to pass down to them. The thought of that makes me sick. I just want love, of any type. I just want to hold someone.

I hate myself so much and I can’t stop.",[deleted],1,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/fe0aud/im_losing_myself/,keep going try try good person every time turn around world take something afford live anymore state world make sick family splintered lost dad mother beyond done dealing messed self make chest hurt never wanted wanted make family life better failed 38 year old man even support let alone help love know turn doctor push many drug feel like even think therapy want blame father want loved loved hate become want normal life want support help loved one wa rock pile shit hate hate remember time chest hurt tired want love someone want better going die like stand thought legally die want stop burden people forget quickly provide nothing world never kissed woman damn loser even imagine child would never want pas thought make sick want love type want hold someone hate much stop,losing,deleted
Letting go the only thing that make me happy,"I’m 30yr male, living alone, unemployed, broke, alone, and the only thing that get me going is my dream to become a filmmaker, but that dream now starting to fall apart.

Filmmaking has been literally the thing that shape who i am today. I’ve been doing videography and editing stuff for almost 10 years, beside doing my passion project, i also earn a living by edit and produce video for small businesses. Overtime I learned alot about the entertainment industry, but i never part of them. Instead i just do my freelance work, but i do have a dream, to make a feature film. Knowing my own lacking, i study and research as much as i could about independent film and unfortunately in my country, indie scene is basically non existent. I decided to fund my own film, because nobody wants to finance a stranger like me. 

Earlier this year, I thought this year will be the year I finally made it. I sold my car and use my saving to fund a film project which i hope can be the one that gets people attention. As i slowly developing the project, i met several industry folks, with the intention of gaining knowledge and get some support, but instead all i got is them dismissed and laughed at my project because I’m a fool to even dream about making a film with my budget, and more importantly, I’m nobody. I was treated nonchalantly. Hate to say this, but i do agree on some of the points they gave.

Now I’m aware, even if i did make the film, the chances for it to actually help me further my career is slim. I love doing this, and i would love to make a living with this, but moneys are tight, the thought of giving up the only thing i passionate the most in my life, kills me.

Today, I’m just laying hopelessly typing this crap on my phone. I lost all the passion, and motivation to keep going. I’m tired of seeing people, i spent my days at home alone. I’m embarrassed with my friends and family, especially my mom, who has been nothing but supportive.

I’m contemplating if i should let go of this dream and looking for a new job at 30yr.",ministerofterrible,0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/fe5kou/letting_go_the_only_thing_that_make_me_happy/,30yr male living alone unemployed broke alone thing get going dream become filmmaker dream starting fall apart filmmaking ha literally thing shape today videography editing stuff almost 10 year beside passion project also earn living edit produce video small business overtime learned alot entertainment industry never part instead freelance work dream make feature film knowing lacking study research much could independent film unfortunately country indie scene basically non existent decided fund film nobody want finance stranger like earlier year thought year year finally made sold car use saving fund film project hope one get people attention slowly developing project met several industry folk intention gaining knowledge get support instead got dismissed laughed project fool even dream making film budget importantly nobody wa treated nonchalantly hate say agree point gave aware even make film chance actually help career slim love would love make living money tight thought giving thing passionate life kill today laying hopelessly typing crap phone lost passion motivation keep going tired seeing people spent day home alone embarrassed friend family especially mom ha nothing supportive contemplating let go dream looking new job 30yr,letting go thing make happy,minister terrible

Some days I feel good (better than usual, at least) and others, like today, just feels like I can't do literally anything. I almost never take naps, and I climbed into bed after doing nothing for hours and took a two hour nap because I didn't want to be awake. Some days I think I am getting better, that I can make better habits and get myself out of this crutch.

Two Different People,"It would be nice to hear from other people what you’re experiences have been like.

When I’m on my own or with people I’m comfortable around, I’m “normal.” My version of happy and normal anyway, whatever that looks like with depression wrapped in. 

Then, when I go out in social situations, I’m someone else. I’m frantic, I try too hard to be funny, etc. I’m socially anxious, I guess that’s the point.

But I find these opposites in writing too. When I’m writing I’m intelligent, I have a lot to say and offer people. But when I speak directly to people I clam up. I have a tiny vocabulary. I swear a lot. I saw the same words/phrases over and over. None of these things is particularly bad on their own but together it translates into me being a fucking mess.

Friends are finally leaving me. My brain is fucking with me.,"This is a long text about what I'm dealing with.. just giving you a heads up.I hate embarrassing myself and I act in a way I dont like. I maybe acting in a way which balances all the embarrassments I deal with. 

I keep thinking about past moments where it's fucking embarrassing and then I hate to fight to being the person to desire to be. By embarrassing it means either people telling me on my face which hurts me and they know it but still choose to say it because they know Im boring now and I don't have the confidence they saw in me they used to. I'm on their side on this cuz I they are true. And I don't know how to help myself out of this. 

 To be honest I'm lonely like literally lonely only because of me. I'm not open about my feelings and try to just move the conversation about general things. I only love people but not give back anything or show it. Theres not a single person who I have a nice relationship with right now. I mean to say I don't have but they do. Few of my friends care about me and don't want me to get hurt but that's all. I don't like my family because I'm thinking like this just because of their conditioning . I hate my insecure mom who is highly egoistic of herself and can't handle rejection or appreciation she gets defensive for very small things and also expects me to show love to her and give the attention she needs all the time and if I don't do it she gets hurt again and gets defensive. I hate that she's like that and that's in me . That is my biggest problem because I have conversations in my head to fix her cuz I don't want her to be that way and I do this therapeutic talk all the time with her and me. Im starting to get sick of it and handle this. I know all the ways she can't get offended and it's not hard and it's my problem to deal with convincing her. I can't fucking do it I wanna leave her but I can't live with guilt she has given me till now that I can't live by knowing she's gonna get mental if I leave her. She has friends but they're cringe as fuck saying I love you or I hate you. All they talk about is that. She wants everything without deserving it. 

When I say all this about her I know that I act like her and when I say I hate her I hate the part of me that's her. That part of me is not leaving me. I try to give people guilt trips unconsciously or give them situations where I get rejected and I won't take it properly. This feeling of being alone after someone shows that they don't like me is what I want to feel but I want to say to mind that noone likes me and I'm alone. 

Today I truly feel like I don't have a friend to share any of my feelings to because it is truly cringe worthy and embarrassment because I feel like this. I have a lot of potential in me . I have great looks. Im smart. I'm talenting in coding. I'm very funny sometimes. But my ego which judges me and judges others gets all its data and fucks me over and convincing me to feel shitty and unmotivated all the time. 

I can't say these things to anyone I know and I'm always confused with the way I think I don't know what's a good thought or a bad thought because they have their own points which are opposite. Im conditioning and people are trying. To get rid of me because they don't like me anymore. I'm boring and I don't want to settle to this but I'm setting. I hate that this happening but not enough.

This is very general when I say people or feelings but this insecurity in a college environment. Everyone is different here and there only a few cool people. Every friend i know is a confident secure person and deals with Thier problems with friends together. I can't have that.

My personality is dead because of the shit thats in my head. The therapeutic talk. The polar opposite debates about feelings. Numbness. And living with the shitty version of myself. I know this is mood. In other times when I feel genuinely happy I have an answer that says just keep going through whatever it is and it's easy. It's not really easy at other times. And we don't know how long should I wait for the next mood switch to happen.",clientmein,1,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/fduleb/friends_are_finally_leaving_me_my_brain_is/,long text dealing giving head hate embarrassing act way dont like maybe acting way balance embarrassment deal keep thinking past moment fucking embarrassing hate fight person desire embarrassing mean either people telling face hurt know still choose say know im boring confidence saw used side cuz true know help honest lonely like literally lonely open feeling try move conversation general thing love people give back anything show single person nice relationship right mean say friend care want get hurt like family thinking like conditioning hate insecure mom highly egoistic handle rejection appreciation get defensive small thing also expects show love give attention need time get hurt get defensive hate like biggest problem conversation head fix cuz want way therapeutic talk time im starting get sick handle know way get offended hard problem deal convincing fucking wanna leave live guilt ha given till live knowing gonna get mental leave ha friend cringe fuck saying love hate talk want everything without deserving say know act like say hate hate part part leaving try give people guilt trip unconsciously give situation get rejected take properly feeling alone someone show like want feel want say mind noone like alone today truly feel like friend share feeling truly cringe worthy embarrassment feel like lot potential great look im smart talenting coding funny sometimes ego judge judge others get data fuck convincing feel shitty unmotivated time say thing anyone know always confused way think know good thought bad thought point opposite im conditioning people trying get rid like anymore boring want settle setting hate happening enough general say people feeling insecurity college environment everyone different cool people every friend know confident secure person deal thier problem friend together personality dead shit thats head therapeutic talk polar opposite debate feeling numbness living shitty version know mood time feel genuinely happy answer say keep going whatever easy really easy time know long wait next mood switch happen,friend finally leaving brain fucking,client mein
Asshole dad doesn't support my dreams. Long rant.,"I'm 24 years old and have recently graduated from college with a BA in art. Art has been my passion since I was a little kid and I hope I can one day have an exhibition showcasing my art. 

So back in 2019 just a few months after graduating college I applied for this artists residence program. I knew that I probably wouldn't get accepted as these  residences are usually very popular and I was still buliding up my
career in art. But I still wanted to try and get more experienced in writing applications and though I'd give it a go and you never know I might just be lucky enough to be accepted. 
This particular application had to be sent in by post. So I asked my mum for a stamp. Later that day my dad sees the stamp booklet and asks what it was doing there. So my mum told him. He just conpleatly lost his shit and started yelling at my mum. He was arngry that my mum hadn't told him about my plans to apply for this residence. I could hear the yelling from my bedroom and came down to see what it was about. 

I can't remember everything that happened and what was said. But basically my dad felt that this was a terrible idea. That the residence wouldn't be good for me and that I shouldn't be moving out. 
I kept trying to explain how there were many benefits of doing this residence. And how I wouldn't be moving away forever. Besides I was 23 at the time. A lot of people my age had lived away from their parents. He, however, couldn't get his head around it. He thought the residence program wasn't legitimate. Despite the fact that I  found out about it through my college lectures and how they literally give us seminars on how to apply to these residences. 

He keep yelling and screaming causing my mum to cry and sleep in my sister's room that night. 

I didn't let the events of that night keep me from pursuing my dream. Fast forward to a few days ago and I'm working on another application for a artist residence. This one also has to be sent in by post. So this time I tell my dad what I'm doing just before he went to bed. He rolled his eyes but didn't say much. 
The next day I'm printing off my application and I can hear my dad speaking negativity about this residences to my mum.

My mum is so kind and loving and supportive of me and my dreams. I really couldn't ask more of her. 
Anyway. I come into the room and tell my dad that I can hear him talking about me. 
He says similar stuff to what he said back in 2019. How he's thinks its a bad idea. How he thinks I shouldn't be moving out. He is of the belief that I'm looking at this with rose tinted glasses. I try to explain how I'm not some stupid little kid just following some whimsical dream. This is my passion. Its the thing I have a degree in and very much plan on pursuing. 
 For some reason he cannot understand what a 
residence involves. I thought the team residence made it fairly obvious. However I try to explain how its a place you live and work in. So you can produce artwork in a proper studio. He's still just shaking his head saying its a bad idea. I ask him why he thinks its a bad idea but he just cuts me off and tells me to tell him why its a good idea.
Once again I try to explain the benefits. Because I'm just making small bits of Watercolour paintings in my bedroom and having a studio would be so much more ideal.
He stars asking questions about how they chose people. I explain about how you send in a cover letter, an artist cv, and images of your work.

For some reason he keeps referring to the residence as a course. My mum and I tell his how its not a course its a place to live and work. He doesn't seem to understand. 
He says how the only people who will benefit from this course are the people running in. 

He seems to believe that because I wouldn't be paid to attend this residence that its a waste of time. 
I'm not even asking my parents for money to fund this residence. I planned to pay the rent myself. 
The he says how I should be looking for work. He's a bit of a booomer. He seems to think that there's loads of jobs going round and I just couldn't be bothered to get one. Not true. 

I had a job not too long ago but it was temporary contract work which ended a few weeks ago. 

He has the nerve to say that when he, himself has been unemployed since the early 2000s and my mum is the main breadwinner.
 He just happens to be related to wealthy parents whom he inherited loads of money from when they died. He doesn't know the struggle of looking for work or having a strict budget. 
I asked if he'd prefer if i were in some dead end job that made me miserable. No he says. He'd like to see me in a job that makes me happy. And he sort of suggests to continue with art on the side but apparently working and doing an art residence is just too much. 

Anyway, getting back on track. He mentioned how he thinks I'm too vulnerable and not ready to move out. I don't know how he's going to react when I have enough money saved up to move out. But he can't stop me from moving out and living my own life. I haven't even been accepted by the residence program and he's acting as if I'm leaving to live on the other side of the world.
Everything up to this point has been very upsetting and stressful and depressing. But than he goes and says that I'm not good enough or talented enough. Thst these no future in this residences. No future in art. 

That fucking hurt but I highly suspected this. I told him that I already knew that. This man hasn't even seen half of my art. Hasn't see what I'm capable of doing. And doesn't understand how the art world works. If I were bad I wouldn't have gotten my BA. It's still so hard to not let his words get to me. I'm still planning on applying for open calls to residences and exhibitions. I know i have talent and I work hard. Even if I'm not currently good enough that doesn't mean I should stop. The only thing that will stop me from having a future in art is if I give up. So I won't give up until I have made it.",jenniferyoung03,0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/fe5ixt/asshole_dad_doesnt_support_my_dreams_long_rant/,24 year old recently graduated college ba art art ha passion since wa little kid hope one day exhibition showcasing art back 2019 month graduating college applied artist residence program knew probably get accepted residence usually popular wa still buliding career art still wanted try get experienced writing application though give go never know might lucky enough accepted particular application sent post asked mum stamp later day dad see stamp booklet asks wa mum told conpleatly lost shit started yelling mum wa arngry mum told plan apply residence could hear yelling bedroom came see wa remember everything happened wa said basically dad felt wa terrible idea residence good moving kept trying explain many benefit residence moving away forever besides wa 23 time lot people age lived away parent however get head around thought residence program legitimate despite fact found college lecture literally give u seminar apply residence keep yelling screaming causing mum cry sleep sister room night let event night keep pursuing dream fast forward day ago working another application artist residence one also ha sent post time tell dad went bed rolled eye say much next day printing application hear dad speaking negativity residence mum mum kind loving supportive dream really ask anyway come room tell dad hear talking say similar stuff said back 2019 think bad idea think moving belief looking rose tinted glass try explain stupid little kid following whimsical dream passion thing degree much plan pursuing reason cannot understand residence involves thought team residence made fairly obvious however try explain place live work produce artwork proper studio still shaking head saying bad idea ask think bad idea cut tell tell good idea try explain benefit making small bit watercolour painting bedroom studio would much ideal star asking question chose people explain send cover letter artist cv image work reason keep referring residence course mum tell course place live work seem understand say people benefit course people running seems believe paid attend residence waste time even asking parent money fund residence planned pay rent say looking work bit booomer seems think load job going round bothered get one true job long ago wa temporary contract work ended week ago ha nerve say ha unemployed since early 2000s mum main breadwinner happens related wealthy parent inherited load money died know struggle looking work strict budget asked prefer dead end job made miserable say like see job make happy sort suggests continue art side apparently working art residence much anyway getting back track mentioned think vulnerable ready move know going react enough money saved move stop moving living life even accepted residence program acting leaving live side world everything point ha upsetting stressful depressing go say good enough talented enough thst future residence future art fucking hurt highly suspected told already knew man even seen half art see capable understand art world work bad gotten ba still hard let word get still planning applying open call residence exhibition know talent work hard even currently good enough mean stop thing stop future art give give made,asshole dad support dream long rant,jennifer young 03

I’ve reached my breaking point-,"Okay so I have absolutely no one to talk to, so forgive me for ranting here and making little to no sense. I just really need to get things off my chest. 

I really want to die. I’ve reached the point where I would be fine with a car crashing into mine and killing me, or being shot, or getting a terminal illness; I’m not picky over how I die, I just want to vanish from Earth. And I’m too much of a coward to do it myself, though I think about it all the time. My family has grown attached to me, despite the fact that they used to hate my guts during my teenage years. I fixed my relationship with them, and I know dying would hurt them but I’m a selfish idiot. 

I recently started college and it’s awful. I used to be a great student in high school, the type of student teachers praise by saying they have a great future ahead of them. But along the way I fucked up. I feel dumber and dumber each day, I see my classmates learning quick while I struggle to understand a simple class. I can barely finish assignments on time and each day I find less reasons to finish them. I fear failing my classes, I’ve never failed one before but at the rate this is going I probably will. My family has put so many high expectations on me, and I’ve always known I would never meet them. 
I’m not even studying what I wanted because my mother disapproved of my original career choice. I wanted to study physics, but she made me study electronic engineering. 
The firsts exams were awful, I know I still have time to recover from my pitifully mediocre scores but I seriously doubt I will. 

I have no friends, my personality is awful and I never learned how to talk to people, I’m too awkward. I’m also incredibly hideous and fat, there’s nothing I like about myself. I absolutely loathe everything about myself. There’s no redeeming quality about me. I used to think I was smart but it’s clear I’m a dumb idiot that never should had been born. I wish my mother aborted me when she had the chance. I’m just a fucking waste of space. 

I can’t even cry anymore. Hell, I don’t even feel anything most of the time. I’m just numb, but sometimes I feel dread settle over me and not leave for days. I’m an useless, worthless piece of shit. I know that. I just want to disappear. I hope to fall asleep and never wake up.

Today has been tough.,"Today has been harder than most. 

Bit backstory: my girlfriend and I recently broke up. It was something out of our control and I don’t blame her or hate her for it, but it meant upending my life and moving 300 miles away and back in with my parents after 7 years of being in my relationship and being independent. I left my life and my cats behind, they were basically holding me together at the time. I lost my job in September and have had a really hard time finding work. So as you can imagine I’m feeling pretty low right now. 

The main issue: my mother and I have never really gotten along. She’s unpleasant to be around for long periods of time. Fine in small doses though. She basically shits on everything I do or try to do. There’s always something negative that she brings to the equation that takes the wind out of my sails. 

I went for a job interview last week, it went okay. Wasn’t great, wasn’t terrible. I was confident that I was on the border of getting it. I got the rejection email this afternoon. It felt like I got kicked in the stomach by a shire horse. It was an awful feeling being knocked back. I applied for 43 jobs and that was my only interview and I didn’t get it. I was feeling pretty bad, then my mum came in to the room. She decided now was a good time to ask “what would you do if you didn’t have me and your dad to feed you and keep you?” A pleasant topic of conversation. I said, “well, I’d be homeless and sleeping rough I’d imagine mum.” She didn’t seem satisfied by this response and decided to go on a tirade about how I should seek unemployment benefits and such. Which I would, but my last ounce of pride won’t let me. I should also mention that I haven’t asked for a penny of charity from her since I got back. Anything she and my dad have paid for is listed on my phone and I fully intend on paying her back when I’m working or have some money coming in. I haven’t loaned money from my mum since I was at uni. Not because I didn’t need the help, I just couldn’t handle the arguing anymore. My sister however, currently owes my mum and dad thousands and they don’t chase her for it. Whenever she needs help they drop what they are doing to help her. I don’t know if I’m just bitter about that because my mum makes the statement “we treat you both the same” all the time, but I know they don’t. 

She continued to twist the knife until I couldn’t take it anymore and just walked out of the room. 

I should say, that she doesn’t seem to mind having me around when a delivery is coming and she wants to go and see a friend, or when I make lunch and dinner, or when I do housework. I feel like a should help out around the house where I can. Most of the time it’s not good enough for her, but at least I tried. 

After all of this I’m just left with this feeling of uselessness and that I’ll never be good enough. Maybe I’m being over sensitive with how much is going on (my ex and I broke up last month, so not that long ago). I don’t know. All I know is I’m not sure how much of this I can take.",ithinkineedhelp188,1,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/fe22sx/today_has_been_tough/,today ha harder bit backstory girlfriend recently broke wa something control blame hate meant upending life moving 300 mile away back parent 7 year relationship independent left life cat behind basically holding together time lost job september really hard time finding work imagine feeling pretty low right main issue mother never really gotten along unpleasant around long period time fine small dos though basically shit everything try always something negative brings equation take wind sail went job interview last week went okay great terrible wa confident wa border getting got rejection email afternoon felt like got kicked stomach shire horse wa awful feeling knocked back applied 43 job wa interview get wa feeling pretty bad mum came room decided wa good time ask would dad feed keep pleasant topic conversation said well homeless sleeping rough imagine mum seem satisfied response decided go tirade seek unemployment benefit would last ounce pride let also mention asked penny charity since got back anything dad paid listed phone fully intend paying back working money coming loaned money mum since wa uni need help handle arguing anymore sister however currently owes mum dad thousand chase whenever need help drop help know bitter mum make statement treat time know continued twist knife take anymore walked room say seem mind around delivery coming want go see friend make lunch dinner housework feel like help around house time good enough least tried left feeling uselessness never good enough maybe sensitive much going ex broke last month long ago know know sure much take,today ha tough,think need help 188

No motivation to do anything.,"Very painfully (for me) over the past few months I've lost my best friend. Despite my trying to make things better I couldn't salvage things. We've gone from a really good friendship to barely talking at the end of the day, mostly because of routine. I still care about this person greatly, but its pretty clear thats not the case for this person

Over that time period, my mental state has just gone down the drain. This person was really my only reason to get out of bed in the morning, and be the best version of me that I can be.

I've gone from an A student, to a B student, to a C student, and now im having trouble bringing myself to do any schoolwork at all. I just want to lay down and sleep, even though im getting less than 5 hours a night.

I've been having suicidal thoughts for the past month and I honestly dont know how much longer I can hold out, with the lonliness and the stress given for being an academic student (Canadian system)

I've always been more of a lonely kid, but over this friendship I was shown how much greener the grass is when you have someone to talk to, someone that (seems) to enjoy your company, and can make you smile.",CanadianLanBoy,1,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/fe20bu/no_motivation_to_do_anything/,painfully past month lost best friend despite trying make thing better salvage thing gone really good friendship barely talking end day mostly routine still care person greatly pretty clear thats case person time period mental state ha gone drain person wa really reason get bed morning best version gone student b student c student im trouble bringing schoolwork want lay sleep even though im getting le 5 hour night suicidal thought past month honestly dont know much longer hold lonliness stress given academic student canadian system always lonely kid friendship wa shown much greener grass someone talk someone seems enjoy company make smile,motivation anything,canadian lan boy
My local hospital doesn’t take my depression and PTSD seriously.,"A bit of background:
I’m 25, F and live in eastern Canada. I live in a small town where more people here fake being ill to get out of work or have other habits.

I’ve been suffering from depression for as long as I can remember being alive. I was first fully aware that I wanted to die since I was 6, I’ve begged for it every day of my life since then and every birthday, that’s what I wished for; even til this very day. 



I’ve been going to a doctor in my town to continue working on my depression, she prescribed me medication which started to make my state worse by an increased amount of suicidal thoughts, more flashbacks, and now irritation as well as mood swings. I’ve been diagnosed with PTSD, Dysthymia and Anxiety. I’m constantly trying to make it a point to address to every doctor I’ve been to in the past 8 years that I literally hate being alive and I’ve even been honest as to how many times in a span of a year Ive tried to commit suicide, even up to date. I’ve tried signing myself into our local hospital to try to be admitted to get real help and they’ve only ever kept me for a night each time. Ive begged to stay and I’m still sent home since I seem calm. 

I have always acted like I was fine in front of people since I was raised that it was not okay to be depressed or show negative emotions as I had an abusive mother. Because of that, I can’t express sadness normally, instead I just seem calm and most thing I’m being sarcastic or trying to be funny. I don’t openly cry in front of others since I honestly hate people seeing me cry when I’m a support figure for a lot of people I know. 


I’ve tried making appointments with psychiatrists (we don’t have psychologists at our hospital, they’re hours away and I can’t drive), but they often push Ativan which doesn’t react well with me. I’ve spoken to therapists and they have said I’m getting help in that way but I also need to be medicated if therapy isn’t doing much for me. 

Does anyone know what I should do?
I can’t keep fighting this anymore. I’ve been doing all that I can and I feel like it’ll never get better when all I do is hide in a bathroom and cry each night, wish that I was dead if there’s no fix for what’s going on or just isolate myself from others so I won’t be a burden anymore.",LadyDeathXIII,4,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/fe57lt/my_local_hospital_doesnt_take_my_depression_and/,bit background 25 f live eastern canada live small town people fake ill get work habit suffering depression long remember alive wa first fully aware wanted die since wa 6 begged every day life since every birthday wished even til day going doctor town continue working depression prescribed medication started make state worse increased amount suicidal thought flashback irritation well mood swing diagnosed ptsd dysthymia anxiety constantly trying make point address every doctor past 8 year literally hate alive even honest many time span year ive tried commit suicide even date tried signing local hospital try admitted get real help ever kept night time ive begged stay still sent home since seem calm always acted like wa fine front people since wa raised wa okay depressed show negative emotion abusive mother express sadness normally instead seem calm thing sarcastic trying funny openly cry front others since honestly hate people seeing cry support figure lot people know tried making appointment psychiatrist psychologist hospital hour away drive often push ativan react well spoken therapist said getting help way also need medicated therapy much doe anyone know keep fighting anymore feel like never get better hide bathroom cry night wish wa dead fix going isolate others burden anymore,local hospital take depression ptsd seriously,lady death xiii
Worth?,"I hate always being reminded our lives are going to school, getting an education, hopefully get a good paying job and pay taxes. I know there are other stuff, Marriage or whatever. But as another year passes, I feel the years flying. I remember being in elementary telling my self in recess, “wow, I’m never getting to high school.” Here I am, I was a positive child and adults had hope for me. It’s sad to see depression hold me down. If I need to be happy I need to change something. I hate taking meds and being on a schedule. People are gonna treat me different if they find out. My dumb arrogant self also lashed out at my girl best friend. I think she hates me. I said sorry like a million times, I wrote paragraphs to get her to forgive me. She recently came up front and told me she was feeling suicidal recently, and me getting mad at her just made it worst. I’m trying to fix it as best as I can. She said if she can get a hug but she still won’t talk to me in class, hallways, or over text. Her reason is she doesn’t like getting personal. And she’s told me in the past she’s had family problems, so I know she’s stressed. I don’t know if I’m annoying her but I’m keeping positive vibes. Just today one of my “friends” with ADHD said his friend was gonna give him a gun and shoot two teachers. I trust one of my gym teachers the most in the school, more than my family. I mean the guys gone through it. I had him for class a year ago, and in that same year he was divorced. He knows depression and stress. Anyways I told him and he thanked me a bunch. I think he’s speculated I have depression, he’s a health teacher and I always talk to him so I know he knows somethings off. He sent me to the VP and told him the story. They both basically hailed me for keeping the school safe. And I’m grateful. I like being reminded people care for me, I just don’t see it. And neither do you probably. Think of an old teacher or friend you always talked too, I’m betting they’re missing you right now. 


Alright I know I wrote a lot but it just kind of blurted out, I knew I had some stuff going on, but now I’ve wrote it out I see the bigger picture of my self. I’m sorry if I’m not making sense, it doesn’t to me either.

What do you do when no one can help?,"I went to a school counselor to talk about some recent &gt;!sexual!&lt; trauma and general ill feelings and I left there feeling worse about myself.

I haven’t been to therapy since 2014, and it was mostly for dealing with depression symptoms.  Therapy helped me tremendously, and I felt better talking  with complete transparency about my baggage with someone equipped to handle it. I went back recently and the interaction boiled down to them telling me 1) I was medicated at too young of an age (started SSRIs very young) and therefore my parents raised me incorrectly, and 2) Skepticism that the therapy ever helped me. He literally asked me, “did that even help if you stopped going?”

He told me his background was in social service, and he recorded the session for the school’s records. He also told me that after this preliminary session he would refer me to a person with the proper  training, but after our session ultimately decided he would take me on for appointments “I don’t normally do this, but scheduling is too hard right now”

Realizing My Friends Might Not Really Care For Me The Way I Thought They Did,"   Well, I’ve been thinking about posting on here and you know what? Today I’m just going to do it. I’ve been feeling abnormally sad for almost five years now. I’ve never gone to get clinically diagnosed with depression so I won’t say I have it-but after having some dark thoughts these past three years...I won’t deny it if that ends up being the case.
   I have always had a small group of friends, and that circle is down to three. Out of those three friends, I have had one since 1st grade. After a mess up on my part (that happened almost three years ago), we haven’t been as close as we once were. We don’t share emotional things anymore. But we do laugh and joke a lot. That’s mainly what our friendship is now. We only talk when we see one another, and if we contact each other over text-she usually finds a way to cut the conversation short. I know I’m loosing her. It hurts but I know she will find someone better than me to be by her side....
   I have a second friend, she’s been my friend since 6th grade. I don’t feel like I’m loosing her as much as the others-but life issues are getting in the way of me seeing her so we haven’t been able to talk much-if at all...
  And my last-perhaps my closest friend now, just admitted today that he doesn’t believe in the whole ‘friendship’ ordeal. He said that he believes none of his friends actually like him-and he said that right to my face today. He’s detached from people, and when he thinks people don’t care about him...he doesn’t care about them. On top of that he’s been really distant lately, and we don’t have the deep conversations like we did in the past. When we talk it’s about nothing in particular and it hurts the most seeing him go because he’s always been there for me during my super low times. In response to what he said, I promised him that I would never stop trying to show him that I cared for him, but he brushed me off and said have fun trying.
   I feel like I’m loosing my friends slowly. I don’t talk to anyone anymore. I feel alone. I hate going out into public because that reminds me of how people have friends...when mine are slowly fading. I don’t know what to do anymore. They are the reason I’ve been pushing through-and the reason I have pushed through in these past five years. I don’t know what to do.
   I can’t talk to them because they aren’t very emotional, and the one that is (the one that I haven’t been able to see due to life issues) doesn’t deserve this type of weight on her shoulders. I guess this is just more of a vent to get this off my shoulders. I could go on and on about so many different things but...this is the one that has been killing me as of lately. 
   Thank you so much for taking the time out of your day to read this. And...I know I sound hypocritical but...please never give in. Please.

I'm tired of being alive,"I haven't been sleeping much lately, I wake up with heavy drowsiness, despite not being able to fall asleep. I don't want to continue like this, I don't want to live if this is what life is.

My daily thoughts are riddled with shame, regret, disappointment, anger, and worry. There is so much I wish I had done differently, or not at all. I don't talk to anyone about it because no one would quite understand. It is much easier said than done to not compare oneself to others, forgive, or move on from the past. I haven't lived a day of my life at the age of 25 because of my circumstances and poor decision making.

I feel helpless and powerless. The world is hostile, overly competitive, and parasitic. The deluded turn to their illusions of grandeur via religion, but no loving god would allow this atrocity of a world. I don't feel I have a place that I belong

I wish I had made friends sooner, I don't have anyone now and I feel that I am just a burden. I wish I had gotten a job instead of letting myself be pressured into post secondary education, I have no money or direction now and I feel that I am a failure. I wish I had stood up for myself in bad relationships, I don't have any self respect now and I feel that I am a weak loser. I wish I had matured sooner, I am very far behind in life and I feel that I cannot catch up. I wish I had any confidence in myself, I am convinced that it is too late to make anything worthwhile because the foundations of my life are rotten and building on rotten foundation is recipe for disaster.

I wish I had a better family, a better community, a better world to live in, and I wish I was a better person. No matter what anyone says, I don't believe much can change.

I'm not like others, I wish I was. I can't use social media at all because it floors me to see others doing things I wanted to do, and seeing the results of the better choices they made.

I wish life were easier, people were kinder, mistakes could be undone, and I wish I didn't feel so down all the time.

I belt myself to stop thinking about women and it's breaking me,"I was bullied for most of my school life. It started to get better at around 11th grade. Before that I have never really experianced girls that were nice to me. But for as long as I can think I have been dreaming about the soft touch of a woman. Not sexually but just being hugged. Or snuggling. Now at the end of 10th grade I started self-improving like theres no tomorrow. And it went uphill for me real quick. I started to work out daily, started fighting sports, joined the volunteer firefighters, volunteer wildlandfirefighters and recently sent out my application for the german red cross. It all went well exept one thing. I still wanted a girl to like me. Now more than ever before after I finished firefighting training and had my first ""psychologically demanding"" firecalls. Sometimes I just come home and wish that a girl would just come out of nowhere and hug me. I am still a kissless virgin even though from the outside I may even be desireable. At least thats what some people tell me. But because most of my life there weren't really any girls that were nice to me, I interpret every single nice thing from a girl as some kind of flirt. Then I get feelings for almost every single girl there was. They could be as bitchy as anything but as long as they're a woman, I would develop feelings for her and make advances. Openly flirting with almost every girl I knew. I was sort of known as the needy guy. Some people told me and I slowly realised that I had no chance with girls if I act like this. Then one of my ""favorite crushes"" (there are a lot of them) had a long talk to me. I told her how I felt about my needyness and my past. She told me I dont have any chance with her (she told me before) but that if I stopped thinking about girls all the time then maybe someone would actually turn up. That was the first time I really talked to someone about my problem and it was devastating. I couldn't stop thinking about women. For years when I'm home alone I'd pretend that there was a girl in my bed. Asking how ""her"" day was, making out with the pillow and everything. Sometimes at dinner I would put two plates on the table and just talk with ""her"" about ""her"" day. I didn't know how to help myself and because of all my volunteering work and sports I don't have time for a therapist. So then I had the idea of punishing myself if I'd think about women. And with no other ideas I started doing that. Every day I'd take my leather belt, take off my top and start belting away at my back. I'd take my phone and turn on porn and start belting myself so I would stop getting an erection when something sexual happens. At school and volunteering work I'd pinch my trizeps real hard whenever I'd think about women or would look at a girls butt or breasts. Now everytime I see a girl I'd just catch a glimpse of her and quickly look away. In the beginning it helped. I stopped thinking about girls. But after some time I was on edge all the time. Hurting myself at the slightest thought of someone. I'd look at women at firecalls or when I otherwise needed to. But otherwise I'd look away. And now it just hurts. My confidence has plumeted. I'm looking at the ground the whole time. I have spots on my back and arms. I am feeling like shit all day. Tired and with no motivation for anything anymore. I just dont know what to do anymore.",DerGuteAlteBen,2,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/fdvb4i/i_belt_myself_to_stop_thinking_about_women_and/,wa bullied school life started get better around 11th grade never really experianced girl nice long think dreaming soft touch woman sexually hugged snuggling end 10th grade started self improving like tomorrow went uphill real quick started work daily started fighting sport joined volunteer firefighter volunteer wildlandfirefighters recently sent application german red cross went well exept one thing still wanted girl like ever finished firefighting training first psychologically demanding firecalls sometimes come home wish girl would come nowhere hug still kissless virgin even though outside may even desireable least thats people tell life really girl nice interpret every single nice thing girl kind flirt get feeling almost every single girl wa could bitchy anything long woman would develop feeling make advance openly flirting almost every girl knew wa sort known needy guy people told slowly realised chance girl act like one favorite crush lot long talk told felt needyness past told dont chance told stopped thinking girl time maybe someone would actually turn wa first time really talked someone problem wa devastating stop thinking woman year home alone pretend wa girl bed asking day wa making pillow everything sometimes dinner would put two plate table talk day know help volunteering work sport time therapist idea punishing think woman idea started every day take leather belt take top start belting away back take phone turn porn start belting would stop getting erection something sexual happens school volunteering work pinch trizeps real hard whenever think woman would look girl butt breast everytime see girl catch glimpse quickly look away beginning helped stopped thinking girl time wa edge time hurting slightest thought someone look woman firecalls otherwise needed otherwise look away hurt confidence ha plumeted looking ground whole time spot back arm feeling like shit day tired motivation anything anymore dont know anymore,belt stop thinking woman breaking,der gut e alte ben
First post here many years of depression,"Hi, depression is something I’ve been dealing with off and on for at least 15 years. I’m 33 married with two young kids, I come from a family with parents who want to be supportive but do not really understand depression and mental health problems. It’s made worse by the fact my two younger siblings are already more accomplished than I am. Anyways I’ve been in therapy 3 times over the last 15 years and quite honestly it’s been a disaster each time, I’m to the point where I no longer believe in psychotherapy as a legitimate means to help myself.

This recent bout has started late October and has been moving into the severe, life affecting depression the last two months. It’s made much worse by having to look my wife and precious children in the eyes everyday knowing I’m failing them. My wonderful children 2.5 and 1 year old bring me so much joy but then so much anxiety that I am failing them, wasting my life in a malaise with no real impending problems. 

Probably the worst part is people who know me but don’t live with me would never know this, even when depressed I can fake it in social situations and I would say people think I’m funny, personable and when I’m not depressed I have a keen mind and have had some mild success in business or other endeavors. So people would be shocked to read or hear how tortured I feel mentally. 

Like an idiot I fell into old traps, trying to just “take the edge off” with a couple drinks in the morning just to get through the tough times, Which the veteran depressed reading this will be shaking their heads knowing how much worse that makes it. Luckily I recognized it early enough and cut it out cold turkey and haven’t had a sip in 10 days or so. Right now I just need some inertia to get out the door, run my small business and provide for them. Today is the worst I’ve felt in years, paralyzed by my demons, it’s absolute agony. 

Becoming a father has been the best thing that’s ever happened to me, but if I fail my children and wife I’ll never ever forgive myself. I need to face things head on but it’s that fear of what damage I’ve done the last few months being negligent and having to once again dig myself out of this hole. You see I know more major bouts of depression are in my future but I worry how many more recoveries I have in me, I make life so hard on myself with the inconsistencies, it’s such torture.

"Nothing matters anymore, getting worse"," Hi..I don't know where else to go. I am devastated right now, feeling like I'm spiraling out of control, I feel so fucking numb from crying my lungs out. Even my best friend is no longer supportive, my family, parents at home are shit. I have no real friends who care, and I can't be bothered to do anything right now, I just want to sleep without waking up to see another morning. I feel so fucking pathetic and shit, I cut myself regularly now and I'm having so much fucking self pity, I'm pretending to be normal because I don't want to lose my best friend, the only person who has helped me come this far from previous suicidal attempts. But suppressing it makes it so much fucking worse I feel like nobody fucking cares, no matter how many times I shout for help. No one close to me cares. I don't know what to do. I'm leaning towards paracetamol poisoning all over again, if I die I die, If I don't I try a different method. I just feel like absolute shit, jobless. I regret everything in my life, every fucking thing, I don't know who to trust anymore, I don't even have a fucking shoulder to lean on while crying my lungs out. Im in a LDR, from past 6 months, (not prior to that) as she's studying overseas, I can't even fucking have her hold me in her arms when I'm feeling like shit. She is the best and supportive, and my best friend but I can't hurt her by harming myself so It's a fucking struggle. I just feel so enraged and angry at everything..I can't fucking find a job due to covid-19. Sometimes it feels like If I had some money to get myself kicked off I can go near her and find a job and at least stay sane. But right now it all seems so fucking impossible I feel like I'm such a fucking mess and I just wish to fucking die right now, I feel so much burden when I inhale, I just want to die.

I need help I am sad,"Hi so I would like to know what's your opinion on this.

So there was an activity at my college, in which students from different schools were coming the univ to see it and explore it. When they came, the college gave them a ticket to get a free meal. We, students of the college itself, are really unhappy with the university because they always have money for anything but the university itself, charging us a lot of money for things that are not there. So we, unleashed, decided to take back what's ours. One guy printed out a lot (maybe like 15-20) tickets of the food and we went there to get the food by ourselves. So at the end of the day, the food was done earlier than usual. We did it only for 2 days out of the 3 days the whole college stuff was happening.  We didnt do it the last day cause they realized something was wrong and printed out a different ticket. So we didnt go, also because they were being suspicious and asking questions. 

Do you think we are getting punished?it was only like 25 juice boxes and sandwiches, that's it, out of the probably 200 or 300 there were there.

Getting work done when Depression is telling you that you can’t do anything and you’re worth nothing kills me. (Unfortunately not literally),"Hey. 16M here. I’m just a wee little high schooler but I feel like I’ve been through a whole ass war with my own fucking brain. For context, my depression got intense at around 7th-9th grade. Finally it’s started to slow down and I don’t want to kill myself as much as I did in middle school. But not everything’s is so hunky dory. I don’t know if I’m alone on this and I doubt I am, but it’s so hard to get motivated to do anything but play video games and smoke weed. Now I know I’ll probably be told that the weed isn’t helping with my motivation, which it isn’t, but that isn’t the issue. My issue is that I don’t have any drive to want to better myself or to do anything other than what is fun to me. Am I alone here? Is this because of something other than my depression? 

I never do homework, I never study, and these days it’s actually affecting all of my grades and that kills me because I could get away with doing *some* of my homework and get amazing grades on tests and 9 times out of 10 I’d pass with a C or above. But now I’m getting Fs in my classes and I just want to quit. I can’t find a reason to continue being in this useless place we call school for my “education”.

Envious of my patient,"I had a patient who was unconscious due to a large spontaneous brain hemorrhage. I remember just gazing at their face and thinking, they don't feel anything. Nothing can hurt them or make them feel sad.

"Thought I did well on my midterms, just learned I barely passed them and can’t get over how I feel like my life is caving in",I’ve been in a serious depressive episode for a couple months and I’ve always been able to say “at least I do good in school”. I need to do good so I can go to a good university after I graduate from this shitty community college and after studying my ass off I thought I actually did well on my midterms but I just barely scraped by. I can’t get over how awful I feel and I know I’m overreacting. I know it’s not the end of the world and I can improve my grades but I feel like a fucking idiot who can’t do anything right and I know all of my professors are probably laughing at how terrible my tests were. All I want to do is cut myself and lay in bed during spring break because I don’t deserve to do anything else. Why can’t I just think rationally about this shit instead of blowing it out of proportion? It’s probably my autism coming through. I told myself it would get better. It’s not.

"Looked In the mirror, and fuck man.","

I have run into 2 major problems in my life atm, it has been eating away at me for the better part of a month. I’ll give you some backstory:

I have people pleaser all my life. I feel like I have always gone with the flow, with people’s expectations of me rather than have my own. I have done that since I was a kid and I’m now turning 20 this year, And with that being said the first problem I have run into is, I don’t know what I want and like partly due to the depression. But mostly due to the fact that I’ve never really done or said what I wanted to to outside forces shutting me down at every turn (school, parents etc.). Idk and it’s driving me up a wall.


2: I thought hard about the people pleaser trait in my being a lot and I have come to this conclusion, I hate who I am. I believe that I am selfish and feel because I haven’t done what I have wanted in my life I am inauthentic. So I go and look for outside validation and love because I feel like I am incapable of it. But when I receive it, and it doesn’t hit the way I wanted it to or things are too fast or far. Like a addict I dump them and look for a new person to give me that feeling I long for. It’s fucked up, because the other people care about me and I do to to an extent, but I prioritize my own feelings and shit first. And that realization fucked me up so bad. Real bad.

I have nowhere and no one else to say this,"This is going to be a long post because i have a lot to say, sorry in advance.

 I dont see any way my life can get on track, I'm 23 years old, i have achieved nothing noteworthy in life and i've generally lived a life of isolation, this stems all the way back from secondary school where i was relentlessly bullied for being black and overweight, i was only 11 years old when i first got diagnosed with depression because of the sheltered life i had lived before then meant i had no idea what people would be like once i got to high school, no one told me that being black was something that people may not like, no one told me that being overweight would be something kids would make fun of, but it happened, for 4 years straight, throughout high school i ran into various obstacles i'd never want a kid to go through, almost weekly fights, bad report cards and parents evenings lead to detentions and 3 day exclusions which lead to me starting to simply skip school and not go, i tried so hard to get myself kicked out of that school because my mother would not take me out of the school, i didnt understand why then and i still dont understand now and i think part of me resents her for that to this day, i truly believe my life could have been so different if i didnt get forced to stay at the school that almost killed me multiple times. 

The bullying definitely subsided a touch in the last year, with kids wanting to get into good 6th forms they started looking to just finishing their exams i guess? But the damage was already done, i started school a pretty normal happy kid with a fair few friends who didnt think about much besides what pokemon i needed to catch to fill my national dex or if i the cartoon i wanted to watch was recorded but by my last year i was could barely be bothered to do anything, i didnt talk to anyone i simply went to school and got the bus home and avoided people at all costs, i had skipped way too much school to get good grades and i could motivate myself to want to study, i was getting the bare minimum to get into 6th form and hopefully that was enough to scrape by. But as if things wern't bad enough i went on a residential school trip with one of my classes that was cut short because I ended up having a severe athsma attack when we got the the accommodation camp, this was my first time having an athsma attack and my first time i'd have ever been to hospital and i was only 15 so my first feelings were obviously of extreme panic, a small part of me i'd say was honestly relieved, maybe this was the end and i wouldnt have to go on, the ambulance got there and i must have asked the responded a hundred times if i was going to die, obviously she cant tell a child 'probably' so she said no and was comforting me, the ride to the hospital felt like an eternity. To wrap this part up obviously i didnt die but i had woken up a week later in the icu surrounded by my family, it was weird seeing my dad and mum together as well as their partners because they had been split up for a long time but i was just happy i woke up i guess. I had to stay in hospital for a few days more after i woke up for tests and rehab, getting used to walking again after being in bed for a week was interesting and a lot harder than i ever thought it would be, i was told that people who suffer acute asthma attacks generally have a low survival rate, i cant remember the exact number but it was low enough to cause a reaction from everyone. We left the hospital and i was told i wouldnt be able to go back to school for at least a month, obviously any kid would be thrilled to hear that but i was super happy because it meant time away from hell on earth. 

However the recovery process during that month kind of set the precedent for a hole i got trapped in and am still trapped in, doing nothing for a month meant i got into some pretty lazy habits but also i got used to being on my own world just playing xbox and watching tv during the day. Transitioning back into school life was harder than anticipated because it was half days to start off with and that was for about 2 weeks. Fast forward a bit and the bullying starts again because fuck it why not bully the kid fresh out of hospital right? it gets to exam period and i have full on sacked off school, i skip most days and get put into the assisted education program where you take exams in a different room and have a personal TA and some counselling sessions, of course none of this really helped me because i just didnt have any care for my education i just wanted away from school asap. I by some miracle without studying at all managed to scrape by with enough GCSE qualifications to go to 6th form on the condition that i would have to take english and maths alongside a foundation year. This leads onto my next problem:

For more reasons unknown to me which i can only chalk up to she cant be bothered, my mum decided for me that i wasnt going to go to a college in my hometown, i would have to instead go to live with my dad and do my 3 years of college there. Now i should probably explain why this is a problem, my dad and I dont get on well, we havent for as long as i stopped being a child and we still have barely any real relationship, i just talk to him like once a month to talk to my little brother and sister who obviously i have no reason to not have a relationship with. I wont go into as much detail here because this post is already feeling too long but theres so much more to get through. Long story short my dad was extremely emotionally abusive, anything that he didnt like would be met with screaming banging on things and threats of physical violence, this would be for anything from not doing the dishes to not studying earlier than what was on my plan. This again warped my view of education because i wasnt really doing courses i enjoyed but rather what was available to me and i didnt feel inspired to commit to it by studying, most of my study time was just sneaking my phone on silent. This went on for 3 years straight, i was isolated, the only person i really interacted with was my abusive dad and my teachers and classmates when i had to. When i tried to confide in my mother she simply told me other people including herself had it worse and hes just strict and does it because he cares about me and wants whats best. So i gave up on that as well. Throughout my life one of the few things i really enjoyed was playing video games and I used it as an escape to just ignore my real life situation and responsibilities, how healthy that is is up for debate but if i didnt have that escape who knows if i'd even be typing this here now. He didn't like that i played video games because he said that it was pointless and took away time i could be studying or looking for work, so he took it away and never let me have it back on any occasion after half of the first year. 

Thats when things got really bad for me, without something to pass the time and take my mind off of things my depression and suicidal tendencies came flooding back, i started self harming and i still look at the scars along my arms sometimes and get reminded of how bad things were back then, i never thought that they would still be there 6 years later, i wish i had thought about that. Somehow 3 years later again without really putting in any effort i managed to complete my A levels and get enough points to get into University. on a foundation entry degree, I guess this was when i was happiest because i was finally free from my parents and maybe i could be someone new and different, I never would have imagined myself where I am now 4 years ago.

Uni life started off fine, i was still avoiding people and keeping to myself but a couple of people on my course would always sit next to me and try to talk to me, I guess because seeing someone sitting on their own in their first year of Uni made them want to include me so i even managed to have friends, the first year had some hardships because i was never taught how to budget or be independent so of course money got tight towards the end but aside from that i don't think my first year had any issues, i passed without any issues and found myself advancing to the first year of the actual degree. I wont go into detail for every year but i'll just say that apart from the odd times we'd go out together I still mostly stayed in my flat playing games or watching stuff online, I didnt party and I didnt study, I just kind of drifted, then for whatever reason i cannot remember i got into an argument with my mum, i cant remember what about but she sent me a message saying that she was done with me and i didnt really know what to feel, I just kind of stopped, I stopped going to uni, i stopped going out i stopped everything, i just started spending every day waking up, playing games and eating junk food, sleep, repeat. As you can imagine having a lifestyle like this really did a number on my mental and physical health. I would go an entire week without showering sometimes more, my only human contact was taking my food from downstairs, this was my lowest point. 

Obviously i failed the year because i didnt attend or do all the work. The next year i was allowed to stay at the Uni and take up a different course, thinking that i could just power through it, but apparently during all of this student finance (the company that pays your tuition fees) turned around and said they wouldn't fund this year of learning for me, which obviously kind of fucked me over completely. Because they told me I wouldn't be funded i decided that there was no point in going, because i certainly don't have 9k just laying around to pay the fees myself, I didn't attend a single lecture all year and lived the same unhealthy life i had lived towards the end of the previous year for the entire year, it was horrible. The one beacon of hope that i could find was that eventually i had to start benefits as i didnt get money to pay the rent or anything so that covered that, meanwhile there was a local game store that ran a tournament for the game a play and i really enjoyed going to that once a week and made friends with the team i was assigned to, my life finally felt like it had some form of normality, i had a decent friend group, i was finally going out and i had something to look forward to whilst i tried to find proper work to fill my time and move into my own place, but unfortunately i couldnt find work and it came time to decide what i was going to do next in the summer, at this time i had another argument with my mum because she began to catch on that clearly something was wrong and i didnt want to go to university and do a degree i had no interest in.

We hadn't spoken in almost a month and i was sure we had cut ties but then she messaged me pleading me to come to an open day for a course that did in all honestly sound extremely appealing to me so i went and the place seemed nice and this where I am now, i got onto the course and i'm currently here now in the same situation but worse that i was in for the 3rd year at the previous uni, i havent attended almost any of the classes i'm almost certainly going to be kicked out or have to retake the year, but thats not even the worst part, the worst part is that i'm still being asked to pay for other years that i was told would be funded including this year, meaning i'm in an insane amount of debt with no way to pay it off, this year also isn't being funded despite being told it would be and i'm currently in negative balance in my bank account with the next payment of my underfunded maintenance loan coming in on the 20th of next month, i havent eaten in 3 days already and i dont feel all that good, my parents aren't an option and i have tried to ask for help in the loans/assistance reddits but i got marked as a scammer because i wasn't getting any replies but kept trying, I don't know what to do, I think I am well and truly ready for the end, I don't see how I can recover from this hole i put myself into, I'm 23 years old, with no degree, debt, no work experience meaning i cant get any jobs despite the 100's of applications i've probably sent off by now, i've never had a romantic partner, hell i've never even had a real best friend, i'm completely alone and I don't think anyone will miss me when i'm gone.

I'm sorry this was such a long read, but I don't have anyone else to talk to and really explain things to, so this is my last resort, I dont think i want to die, but i really don't see how I can live

I hate my best friend,"let me start off by saying that I hate my best friend sometimes not all the time. The basic reason is because she's so perfect and I feel like such a waste and piece of shit when I see her. I'm 16 and a sophomore in high school. We met last year as freshmen and I had never had any friends before so I immediately just accepted her. She was 13 when we met so she started kindergarten early and skipped a grade. then there's me who's two years older but nothing compared to her. She gets straight A's, takes all AP and honors classes, made VARSITY softball as a freshman (age of a 7th grader), got the lead roles in all the theatre shows, and just has a perfect life. 

Then there's me who doesn't have the best home life. I've tried telling her I can't sleep over because I need my meds and for other reasons. But then she just tells me ""oh everyone feels sad sometimes. You don't need those stupid pills."" Or if I tell her that it's my anxiety and ADHD pills she is like ""everyone has some form of ADHD. Have you seen everyone who can't pay attention? Those pills don't do anything""

I'm very reluctant to end our friendship because I don't have any other friends. Also my Mom has gotten really close with their family and I can't end the friendship beacuse that would be awkward. I feel like this is toxic though.

I need your advice,"I feel tired. Nothing brings me a joy. I lost all my fucking hobbies. I started smoking a lot. I have alcoholic dad, he often lies, also he borrowing my money, but never give them me back. Luckily, my mom isn't such an alcoholic, but she also drinks a lot. I remember, when i was a child, my parents often dont have money to buy tge food, so i used to visit my grandma, and take some food from her, to feed me and my younger brothers. i remember, once my dad came back home, so drunk, that he beated my mother,and btoke a glass door. There were a fucktone of blood.It was sticky and smelled horrible. When i was 13 i was raped by my drunk dad. Nobody knows about it. Also 2 months ago,i found a gf, but she broke with the me up.

I'm having a hard time.,"What do u do when you're in a dark place?
I'm married, I have one kid, dog, cat, house to clean.
I'm sick rn (just cold, but I have UC, so it's worse for us). Last yeah I was in hospital 5 times. This year one. All. Because of stupid UC. I hate myself, I hate how I look. I don't feel any support or love from anyone in my life except my little daughter. She's the only reason I don't commit suicide. I don't have strength anymore. There are plans to have 3 surgeries in near future. One of them is gastric sleeve - because I can't get rid of the weight because if the medicine I use, I feel ugly and fat. I miss the lovely feeling u get from first kisses, from love, excitement, happiness. It's just... My life is dark rn. I think about suicide alot, I've told my husband, mom (who doesn't belive clinical depression is a real thing), my therapist (who has a hard time with me, because I'm a stubborn little Satan). I don't know what to do... I know where I can get sleeping pills, so I'm just afraid my daughter will loose her mother soon.
And I'm in Norway, I'm afraid of telling doctors about my suicide thoughts because here they are really happy to take away child from your family for every little shit. I don't know what to do. I'm done with this whole life and shit. I have pain in my whole body and I don't have any pain relief meds (because Norway only gives you paracetamol fuckery).",DepressedPandaLola,0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/fdw7fv/im_having_a_hard_time/,u dark place married one kid dog cat house clean sick rn cold uc worse u last yeah wa hospital 5 time year one stupid uc hate hate look feel support love anyone life except little daughter reason commit suicide strength anymore plan 3 surgery near future one gastric sleeve get rid weight medicine use feel ugly fat miss lovely feeling u get first kiss love excitement happiness life dark rn think suicide alot told husband mom belive clinical depression real thing therapist ha hard time stubborn little satan know know get sleeping pill afraid daughter loose mother soon norway afraid telling doctor suicide thought really happy take away child family every little shit know done whole life shit pain whole body pain relief med norway give paracetamol fuckery,hard time,depressed panda lola

Suicide Attempt?,"A couple weeks ago, I overdosed on some Xanax I had lying around and chased it down with some vodka. It put me into a deep sleep and that took me around 36 hours to completely recover from. A friend found me at some point during this since I wasn't returning any of their calls and they know what I struggle with. Anyway, for some reason, I haven't really thought about what happened at all since then and I guess I kind of just shook it off (or tried to). But now that I'm thinking about it, I'm questioning what my intent was behind doing what I did. I didn't ""plan"" to kill myself but I remember thinking to myself ""if this kills me, that's okay."" Should I consider this a suicide attempt or just an odd lapse of judgement? I should mention that I have attempted suicide before and the thought process was much different than what happened this time which is part of the reason I'm so confused.",mthammer1,3,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/fdsdvo/suicide_attempt/,couple week ago overdosed xanax lying around chased vodka put deep sleep took around 36 hour completely recover friend found point since returning call know struggle anyway reason really thought happened since guess kind shook tried thinking questioning intent wa behind plan kill remember thinking kill okay consider suicide attempt odd lapse judgement mention attempted suicide thought process wa much different happened time part reason confused,suicide attempt,mt hammer 1
Advice on getting out of the mentality of not wanting to live.,"I know it’s better to see an expert rather than stranger on the internet but I’ve been to 2 therapist and they haven’t helped. 
I’m 23, male, fit and healthy, come from a good upper middle class family who support me well and I really have no hard struggles to deal with. Despite all this since about the age of 10 I’ve wished I was never born and would rather be dead. Really the only thing keeping me from suicide is that I don’t want to put my family/ loved ones through that pain. This may be decent enough to keep me alive but still isn’t much of a viewpoint to live from, there are times I resent my family because I have to endure the pain and stress of life just because of them. 

I would just much rather be dead than go through the stress of living and working for the rest of my life, call it depression or laziness or whatever but it’s just my viewpoint in life and I can’t shake it. 
Does anyone out there have a similar mentality and have ever thought or been told anything to truly shift them out of that mindset? Therapy has never done anything to help me shift out of this and I almost feel like it’s too much of a therapist to be able to do so.",Imagine17,4,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/fdw24a/advice_on_getting_out_of_the_mentality_of_not/,know better see expert rather stranger internet 2 therapist helped 23 male fit healthy come good upper middle class family support well really hard struggle deal despite since age 10 wished wa never born would rather dead really thing keeping suicide want put family loved one pain may decent enough keep alive still much viewpoint live time resent family endure pain stress life would much rather dead go stress living working rest life call depression laziness whatever viewpoint life shake doe anyone similar mentality ever thought told anything truly shift mindset therapy ha never done anything help shift almost feel like much therapist able,advice getting mentality wanting live,imagine 17

I'm tired,"How do I say that I want to lay in bed all day and do nothing? How could I convey to my parents that not wanting to exist is one of few thoughts that I have? I don't want to work, but still my parents force me to, I know this might sound as if I'm lazy. And I am, no doubt in that. 

Tbh I didn't ask to be born, let alone grow up to do stuff that I'm not interested in. If I were to have my dream job, I'd work on it in my pace, but obviously that isn't how it works.

I always come to work, most of the time I'm late, 10-20 mins but I still arrive and work. 

Now I want to run away, cuz I'm tired of them complaining about how I always sleep or that I'm lazy and do nothing all day, that I'm always in my room and not check in on them. That I can't smoke weed to cope with my thoughts.

We only get one life. One. I don't want to spend that time thinking about suicide, and then complain in my head about the options and how painful or too fast it's going to be. 

I don't want to run away, but most of our time we've been together all I hear is an in depth negative comment of how my life is, and contrast to a simple ""I love you."" I do get ""how are you feeling today?"" Or ""what are you up to today?"" But I can't say anything with honesty cuz then they'll start to ask questions that I can't answer without breaking down and shit. 

I almost don't care about family and friends. But I think one fateful day, I'll make that irrational decision and run away. I really am tired of listening to the implications of how bad my life is, and I don't want to hear it anymore. I just need a little push that goes a little too far, then I'll probs snap and head the fuck out. Who knows.

I'm angry at myself and them, and honestly I want to hit stuff and scream at the top of my lungs. But I gotta keep it together, right?

Took a creative writing class because it's the only thing I'm good at. Now I feel like sh*t.,"Writing is basically my only talent. It's the one thing I can do with consistency. I'm not athletic. My art is passable but nowhere near good. I can't do stuff with computers. I can't make music. Don't do anything with friends because I don't really have any. So I write. 

Didn't mesh with one of my classes for this semester. Subbed it with a CW class because why not? We had to do a setting/dialogue assignment a while ago and just got them back. 

In short, I did sh*t, apparently. 

Basically, it wasn't really what we were supposed to do for the assignment. That's fine; I misunderstood the instructions and will do better next time. The problem is, he didn't say he liked anything I did. I did a little piece based on a project I've been kicking around that I really liked. I thought it was good. I wanted it to be good. I wanted someone who does this stuff professionally for a living to think it was good. But the note he left read to me like he didn't really care about it or didn't like it. 

And that hurts. Really really hurts. Writing is basically my only talent. I want to publish something someday. I want to be able to hold a book I wrote in my hands and feel like all those sh*tty experiences I had in high school and so far in college could be balanced out by something good I did under my own power without anyone else. Something that could only be chalked up to me. Something that could get me some modicum of respect. Something that could prove I'm not just some boring person with nothing interesting about them who's completely, utterly average.

Hey.,"I'm posting here for the first time on my main reddit account. People I know will probably see this, they'll probably laugh, but I don't care anymore. I need to vent my feelings someplace. I'm a male, so the general stigma around depression for men is to just 'suck it up' like we don't have emotions. Things haven't been going well for me for a long time, and i'm constantly miserable. I feel as if nobody cares about me, and that life will never get better at all. I've never had anybody i'd consider a true friend really my entire life and now i'm 20, it's starting to really hurt. My social circle consists of two people, to which i'm sure they can't stand me. They're always making stupid jokes and putting me down, but - shit, they're the closest people I have to real friends, and the only people I talk to on a daily basis. I'm at rock bottom right now. Every single friendship I've ever tried to make has just turned people away from me, like i'm some monster. I don't even feel human anymore. I don't feel like I fit in anywhere. I need help. I need to fix myself, i'm a broken person. I don't even know what to do with myself anymore, honestly.

Red Dead Redemption 2 helps a lot.,"I've been getting progressively worse throughout this year, and I found myself having the exact same days over and over again.

"How I feel at the moment. If anyone needs any motivation to seek help, this is it. Years of avoiding signals to get help can lead to a breaking point if the person isn't strong mentally, like me.","The last couple of months    ,             I've been tired . 

 I wanna die. Really badly. I don't wan't to cause the people that somehow still love me this pain, they need me here. But I am just so tired, so fucking tired.  I'm tired of this sad, mean, world. I feel like I can succeed, but I don't see the point if I still will not be happy. On the other hand I get the point, try to make family happy, and spend the little time we have with the ones we love. Someone of you may say, ""at least you are lucky you have people that love you this much"", and that is true. If it wasn't for them, I would not be here a long time ago. However, perhaps the feeling that brings within me the most pain and sorrow is: what if that love is not reciprocated? Don't get me wrong, I love these people. But I don't love spending time with anyone. I don't even love spending time by myself. I don't know what I want or what will make my day better. The thought of going through the same cycles of just trying to find some little piece of happy in the day for me and my loved ones for the rest of my life makes me not want to live through it. I find the bad in every activity, see the negative flaw of every person, while at the same time try to keep 'face' as much as possible. I think I can summarize this feeling into: I feel guilty for the pain that I cause my loved ones, but at the same time I am so fucking selfish. I just can't take it anymore. I feel like I am loosing my shit, I don't even know if I am depressed, crazy, bipolar, i don;t know. It just hurts. I want it to stop. \*I wanted better for myself

&amp;#x200B;

Overall, I don't know why I am writing this. 

I don't even want any help or input{

I just want this sadness to go way, I can't go around another day with my head down and my eyes filled with tears. I just feel like I wasn't born to act like this, I wanted to be strong physically and mentally in order to provide for my loved ones, not tear them down with my negativity. 

everyone problem is bigger than mine. I am just a selfish bitch who is too much of a pussy to deal with his own fucking emotions. There are people in this world who have gotten a much shittier hand. yet here i am fucking wanting to die. how does this make any sense?

It's also really hard to hide being so fucking sad; I am 6'6, live with my loving girlfriend, and trying to be social in years when I still had hope means there are still people who think I want friends in my life that try to reach out once in a while. Only to receive an excuse/ insult/ rambling when I try to avoid them. 

&amp;#x200B;

No matter how much effort I put into happiness, I can't seem to get close without cheating. Sure, some things make me happy, but as soon as they do, my mind almost tries to find the negative in the situation. 

&amp;#x200B;

To end this shit, I wanna make a wish.   
I wish for the kids who have to be strong, to have bull sized balls, and help every person in need. 

Because the false sense of protection is the last thing that they need. 

If you can't do it, don't say you can. Because when you don't, or aren't here, they will stay behind wondering why you every left.

Now what? [when the last thing you enjoy is gone],"I am use to depression causing me to eat tons of food. I self medicate that way, even with meds and therapy- food is usually the only thing that can distract me. 

Now, however, food is bland and gross. I get no satisfaction from it at all and now just eat once a day because *science* says it gives me energy.

Now I feel unsatisfied. It was the last thing I still enjoyed. I can’t read, I can’t write, my musical instruments (cello, piano, guitar) are literally gathering dust. I stopped playing video games that require thought, I haven’t sung in half a year. I hav n’t drawn since before Christmas.

Strange ways to self harm?,"So after some deep soul searching the past couple of days i have come to the conclusion that i am still self harming (29/F) but not by cutting myself like i used to when i was very young. I seem to have created this character, or other personality i suppose? Where i just want to fight everyone, and I won’t back down, i’m not normally a fighter and every single time i hate myself for my behaviour the day after. I guess my thinking is that if i get myself into fights, i’m going to get hurt and a part of me is hoping to be seriously injured so i can just have a break from life 🙄

Rediscovering Meaning in the midth of it,"To everyone out there, the people who have suffered from depression, perhaps for many years. This is my first post, I am, like so many of you lying in bed, have been for many months, known this state for decades.

You are not alone. And whoever you believe yourself to be right now that is not true. remember the person you were when you were fine, happy, in a better place. Feel it, embody that. I know that I am holding on to it. And if life has been mostly dark it helps to believe that experiences of happiness and joy exist somewhere outside of this state...just like Martin Luther king believed in his dreams even at that particular time it seemed impossible.

I do not know what caused you to land hard in this state, for me it was relationship loss, failure, deep loneliness and isolation-I have no family and lost my relationship/friendships to depression- people left-, though life circumstances (financial issues/living environment and of course the abusive childhood) AND my reactions to them e.g. blaming myself, self-sabotage, feeling futile, discouraged, bad habits, unhelpful implicit relational and emotional patterns that keep repeating. Whatever it is that led into this black hole. I guess the situation gets more frustrating with every attempt to heal that did not work. I tried many medications (almost all of them), several psychiatric stays, several years of therapy (CBT, depth psychology), the Hoffmann process, all kinds of meditations, body work, “giving up and surrender”, Eckhart tolle etc you name it.. they all helped a little but nothing really worked in the long term.

And it sucks that nothing seem to work permanently. 

However, I deeply believe that there is meaning imprinted in everyone’s heart. What is your life worth living? What would you like to experience?  If you we’re dying what really matters to you?Lying in bed, can you imagine and feel experiencing it? The happiness, the joy, whatever it is you wish for? In every ayahuasca experience and every other methods that helped me temporary what really helped was seeing clearly this pattern of depression replaying (the thoughts, the emotional pain, the energetic pattern) and then break free of it for a while until familiar patterns re-emerge. It is like getting on a diet and putting on weight again... rebuilding relationships is a huge part of my recovery. So I guess I wanted to reach out to you and ask the question what dreams do you have today? How can you believe in them in your head first and in your body? Often the despair is exactly next to this dream. But keep building that belief. You are not alone, please do not give up.

The Beast is pulled from the Dead Sea. It’s body is a salted wreck, and 7 heads top 7 ruined spines, and it is classified Gastropoda Megido by the Great Philosophers, and their steel physicians spit lightning down the nerves and its thrashing causes

The concrete bunker under Bikini Atoll where the pristine carcass of Einstein is still breathing in its galvanised cradle and a host of mathematical spectres are recording the convulsing patterns of his immortal cortex and from it they realise

That there is a Ford T-Model in a dusty cobalt sheen travelling Route 66 surrounded by a corona of cyanide and sulphur and the passengers are twice as worse as the driver and the drivers nails curl around the steering wheel and the colour of his eyes is the same as the arterial shades seen in the severed limbs of the myriad cadavers littering the streets where


A company of knights are solemnly striding through the wreckage and their banner is a dying CRT monitor from which a host of wires vomit forth into the shuddering rubber cancer of the power grid and upon the screen can be seen

A low resolution image, a pixel rupture bloom in which can vaguely be discerned the silhouette of a pallid hairless figure, and it slowly turns towards the camera which whines and coughs molten filament in protest at the eyes of the thing which

i think it’s time.,"i’m 17, im a senior in high school. i wake up, i go to school, i come home, i do my homework, i do chores around the house, i take care of the pets, i take care of myself, i eat when i should and i shower and i keep my room clean. i go to the gym and i actively produce art. i listen to music, i play guitar, i spend time with my mom and friends. im not unhappy, my life just feels so dull and gray. i’m not sad or angry, i’m not upset about anything. 

there have been previous years of my life that were overcome by anxiety and major depression and self harm and even a suicide attempt. but then i was sad, i was angry and confused and disgusted. i’ve suffered ptsd since age 12, and that affected me a lot. it still affects me, especially now that i have a form a physical ptsd (that’s how my doctor described it, i don’t know what else to call it) from overdosing 2 years when i tried to kill myself. 

but trauma aside, i don’t feel anything negative. of course i have my bad moods like anyone else, but really i’d say i have more good moods than bad moods. i laugh, i smile, i joke (a lot, i’m the comedian of my circle). 

i tell you all of this because it’s so odd that i live my life on autopilot, doing everything i should and being more positive than i used to be. but almost every hour of my day is filled with thoughts of suicide. i fantasize of slicing my wrists open to watch the blood pool in the tub beneath me. i imagine driving to the old hanging tree on the other side of town in the middle of the night and leaving my body dangling for someone to find in the morning. walking on the sidewalk i laugh to myself as i think about jumping in front of the cars rolling by.

to think that i was full of energy and ideas 2 days ago is beyond me since i've barely had the energy to get out of bed this morning. i also don't have the energy to cry anymore, so now i'm just empty and wanting to die. also this post doesn't really make much sense, but i'm super depressed and empty that i feel like i can't function anymore",snoos_operator,1,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/fdvtyl/i_feel_so_empty_at_the_moment/,wa perfectly fine 9pm last night randomly started cry nowhere wa watching perfectly normal youtube video although forgotten wa anything upsetting triggering go sleep 10ish assume better wake wa wrong woke still depressed cry wanting get bed anything let alone go uni work study get get ready although felt like took eternity go uni found really overwhelming remember else happened decided go back home student flat try take mind work even though deadline coming pretty fast think wa full energy idea 2 day ago beyond since barely energy get bed morning also energy cry anymore empty wanting die also post really make much sense super depressed empty feel like function anymore,feel empty moment,operator

They’re not exactly wrong, but its not even ounce every two weeks, and not for the reasons they think (bullying/ people being less than kind).

I don’t feel loved by anyone and I don’t think anyone loves me,"Im a freshman in college. I feel terrible writing about all my problems on an online forum, but I’ve gotten to this point in my life where I just feel stuck and I feel like I can’t confide in my friends or family. I feel sad all the time. I don’t like myself and I don’t think I ever will, but what gets me to care about myself the most is when people show they care about me because it reminds me of what makes me happy. 

But lately I just feel like a burden to everyone. I recently told my close (best?) friend at college that I hate myself and that sometimes, even though I would never do anything to myself, I feel like there’s no point in me being here. She told me that she doesn’t want to hear stuff like that and that she’s going to distance herself because that made her worry about me all the time. And I understand and that I should be going to see a counselor but it just hurts. Because yea if my friend told me that I would worry but I also wouldn’t push them away because I would understand that they just need someone. 

It hurts that I put my whole heart into all my relationships and that I would do anything for the people I care about and to lift them up but at this point it feels like they wouldn’t do the same and I just feel alone. I feel like everyone is fed up with me and that I’m just sad and there’s so many things missing from my life and I don’t know what’s wrong with me. I don’t know why I try so hard to be this amazing friend and person to everyone around me and it gets me nowhere.

SSRIs and NDRIs and not killing libido,"I'm a mid-20s woman with rapid-cycling bipolar II but I'm posting here because I'm asking about antidepressants and how to control my depressive episodes.

My moods were under control when I was on lithium and zoloft, but the zoloft (50 mg, so not much) absolutely ZAPPED my sex drive. I would force myself to do it to please my partner (no, he did not coerce me). Aside from that, I felt the best I'd ever felt. No complaints otherwise.

Last June, I went off the zoloft and stuck with the lithium and felt fine, but I felt some depression symptoms coming back after a couple months. My anxiety and reactivity increased, but I was still WAY better off than with no meds whatsoever.

In December, my psychiatrist recommended an NDRI to help prevent a change in libido. I started wellbutrin (100 mg so again, not much) and it was definitely helping, but now I'm feeling some depression symptoms coming back again. I have spent the last week thinking I'm stupid and pathetic and useless for no apparent reason. My psychiatrist thinks I did better on an SSRI, but the lack of libido was awful and not something I ever want to experience again. I know that particular symptom varies from person to person, so I wanted to know about others' experiences with those classes of antidepressants and if symptoms varied from drug to drug, even within the same class.",scorpio_szn,4,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/fdyyl9/ssris_and_ndris_and_not_killing_libido/,mid 20 woman rapid cycling bipolar ii posting asking antidepressant control depressive episode mood control wa lithium zoloft zoloft 50 mg much absolutely zapped sex drive would force please partner coerce aside felt best ever felt complaint otherwise last june went zoloft stuck lithium felt fine felt depression symptom coming back couple month anxiety reactivity increased wa still way better med whatsoever december psychiatrist recommended ndri help prevent change libido started wellbutrin 100 mg much wa definitely helping feeling depression symptom coming back spent last week thinking stupid pathetic useless apparent reason psychiatrist think better ssri lack libido wa awful something ever want experience know particular symptom varies person person wanted know others experience class antidepressant symptom varied drug drug even within class,ssri ndris killing libido,scorpio zn

"Been back on medication for depression and anxiety for the past week and I still feel... Like.. Well, you know. Need advice.","Been put back on antidepressants to help me with anxiety and depression. Also, short term benzo. Nothing is going right in life at the moment. And I've taken to hurting myself in anyway as much as possible.

I have no control and alone in this, no one that actually wants to walk with me through this... Which, is the norm.

And, I've done what I always do, which is cut everyone off, delete/deactivate everything, go to work with a mask on every day, crying myself to sleep every single night.

Guess, knowing that I'm actually getting up and going to work is a good thing. As last time I just let everything go. I'm not as deep as I was back then, but I am still sinking right now.

Don’t know how to keep going with the award system broken in my brain,"I see the brick walls where I used to see beauty. Eating no longer feels pleasurable. My hobbies make me agitated. My friends make me anxious.
The only part of my brain that still works is the fear response. 

I’m not sure how much longer I can keep going. I grew up being taught to do the right thing—and I know continuing on is the right thing—but I didn’t realize how much human sanity relied on positive emotions. We are not guided by instinct—we are guided by these emotions. Mine are directing me towards death, and I wonder why, in the most advanced on minds, this pathway exists (suicide is unique to humans even though animals kill themselves).

Advice for a significant other of someone with depression,"I have been dating my bf for about 4 months so the relationship is fairly new. Yesterday we were supposed to hangout but he stood me up and texted at 11pm saying he overslept. He told me that we needed to talk about something tomorrow and when I asked if he could give me a topic just so I am not so worried he said it was about his depression. 

We have never discussed depression before however my ex also struggled with depression and suicidal thoughts throughout our 3yr relationship. I always did my best to be loving and supportive to my ex but I also felt like I didn’t know the best things to say.

And I'm right back where I started...,"I had been doing so well for months and everything has come back full circle, if not worse. This move was supposed to be great for the both of us. More money and better opportunity for him. Getting away from all the bad stuff in our old town and new opportunities for me. But, everything is not how we would hoped it would be. Money is even tighter than before. I don't know how he's going to make his car payment, or pay for internet, or rent. Even make the trip back to see his parents this weekend. Nothing we do seems to be enough or even matter.

I am beyond stressed. I'm barely sleeping anymore, I just can't shut off my mind. All the thoughts racing back and forth in my mind of the things that I should be doing instead of sleeping. Like cleaning, finding a better job or a second job. I lay awake stressing about how to help more when I feel like everything I do now isn't enough, and I'm just waiting for everything to come crashing down. 

Yet, on the other hand, I am ANGRY. I'm angry that I'm getting no help from him. I do all the household chores amidst his claims every day of ""after work I'll come home and clean"". It's my paycheck and any extra cash I get a hold of that is immediately spent on bills because his check wasn't enough because sales were down the last month, or was spent on game passes and subscriptions for games. I was the one who drove there and back to go do his errands while he was sitting on the beach in Mexico with his friends. 

And I. Feel. Terrible. 

I'm right back to being sucked into this numbness, this darkness. All I want again is to just not wake up in the morning. To have everything just be over. The thoughts of suicide and self harm are back in full force and the only reason I haven't harmed, is because I simply don't have a razor blade in the house...

I don't know what to do,"Hi guys,

it is the first time that I write on this sub and it is also one of my first posts but honestly I feel myself sinking and maybe writing about it will help me. By the way I'm Italian so forgive me in advance for my English.

I'm a 20M and I've been suffering depression for 5 years now, before I thought it was adolescent sadness and I have never given it too much weight. But after two path of psychoanalysis with two different psychotherapists I was diagnosed the ""thing"".

I'm struggling every day with suicidal thoughts and the situation is going worst cause the situation in my home is terrible, I live with my grandma (who also suffers of depression and take Xanax and prozac every day) my mother who is a strong career woman but she uses me as her personal therapist since I remember and my little brother who is my only light in this house. My father works in another city and I don't see him that much. In the last six month my father said to my mother he don't love anymore her and there is another woman. I don't judge him, who am I to do it? But now I've always my mum emotionally destroyed that reach for my help, but I don't know how to help her and more the time goes on more I can't talk with my dad normally.

I tried to escape from this situation in October moving away in another city, I thought I need to live alone and away from that house, but the depression strikes hard on me and I had to return in my original home to afford to return in therapy.

Currently the situation is becoming uncontrollable, even my friends have noticed it, I've always been very good at hiding my problems, and one of the last evenings they have made me a sort of intervention for my drinking problem. I honestly reveal them that I don't have suicidal thoughts only when I drink.

I hate my self so much, I'm known in my city for my drunken adventures and I don't like it but the thought of stop drinking kills me.

Overreacting VS social isolation,"I really do not understand why I am isolated for ""coming across"" a certain way.

(I'm human, others aren't I guess?) I guess depression has made me ""unapproachable"". Which I don't grasp, because I am constantly in the presence of people who treat me like dirt (which obviously puts me in the offensive).

A lot of people around me also get defended by their friends when they face trials, I.E. ""they're having a hard time, just try to understand them"".  But I get told to change. As if I don't deal with my own? It makes no sense.

Does anyone else do this? Face isolation because people misunderstand their emotional turmoil? This has caused me great hardship, stress, and mental breakdown. It'd be nice to feel normal.

"If you never had a crush, be grateful","It's the worst catalyst to depression. Period. Remember all your problems? Now they are amplified.

It hurts and it ruins your head it's either suicide or find salvation in that person. I've never hurt this much over fucking fiction. This person as I know it is in my head. I am in love with a person I created, I don't even know this person, just her exterior, yet I feel like I'm close to this person and it hurts not imagining a fake relationship. It hurts so fucking bad it feels good to think abandoning this world. No regrets. Why?

The other night, for example, I woke up screaming. I had been dreaming that I was eating a bowl of cereal and looked down and my spoon was covered in spiders. I actually like spiders so I am not sure why it scared me so bad. My husband reached over and held my hand and shushed me until I calmed down. It seems like he is too good to me always. I feel like I don't deserve it.

Tonight I looked outside the window at the world as I often do throughout the day. I thought to myself: the people that I have met, all of them, all of the people I have come across... does anyone of them ever think of me? Ever? Do they ever wonder how I am? Even just for a second? If they did, I wish I knew, because I feel like a shadow living life alone inside my house day after day. 

At the same time I feel that I am unworthy of friendship, community, love. Today at therapy my therapist asked me my goals. I said... to have a friend and to be a part of a small community that truly cared for me. But I have never felt or experienced that. I only know what friendships and loving communities are like from observing others. I truly pity anyone who would want to befriend me, because I think I would make the worst friend.",marsupial65,2,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/fdutq4/wondering_late_at_night/,midnight cannot sleep cannot remember last time slept night sleep tiny spurt throughout day never stay long often nightmare even stay sleeping time night example woke screaming dreaming wa eating bowl cereal looked spoon wa covered spider actually like spider sure scared bad husband reached held hand shushed calmed seems like good always feel like deserve tonight looked outside window world often throughout day thought people met people come across doe anyone ever think ever ever wonder even second wish knew feel like shadow living life alone inside house day day time feel unworthy friendship community love today therapy therapist asked goal said friend part small community truly cared never felt experienced know friendship loving community like observing others truly pity anyone would want befriend think would make worst friend,wondering late night,marsupial 65

Something is wrong with me,"I'm not one to reach out to strangers for help but something is wrong with me. I've felt empty for a long time now but I always contributed that to a lack of motivation.

 I fill this void so to speak with temporary pleasures like women, sex, working out regularly, and winning in games but they're all just distractions

Today I woke up and I was just sad and I don't even know why. I'm usually able to hold such feelings back but I woke up at 3am in the morning after going to bed a almost 1am. I was absurdly hungry and made some eggs and I just started crying. I just sat there eating these damn eggs with tears streaming down my face. There wasn't even anything wrong, I shouldn't be sad and yet I feel lower than I ever have. I've got a good family, plenty of friends, a job that is adequate for the time being, and I'm reasonably good looking to my knowledge but it's never enough. No matter how much I improve physically, no matter how much I win at DBFZ, no matter how many woman say I'm hot at the end of the day I still just feel empty.
Now I'm not here claiming to be depressed without even seeing a doctor but I don't like this. It seems like the only time I'm happy is when I'm in a relationship, but needing to constantly use a girl as a crutch to justify my existence isn't much better than being miserable by myself. I don't even enjoy life anymore I'm just going through the motions because I have to.

I don't know what to do and it frustrates me. I'm by no means suicidal but I'm tired of feeling tired. Every morning I wake up after 3 or 4 hours of sleep and lay there doing nothing. I feel useless and undesirable, I go on tinder and maybe I'll have a match or two but they just bore me with their monotonous bios and questions. It's not like I'm on there being toxic I do my best to make conversation but the thoughtless, close ended responses these girls send me annoy me and I just drop them.

I just want to feel content but I'm not even sure if I remember how.

Your typical normie trash with depression. :):,"I can't even tell when it all started, my memory has been very fuzzy past few months.So let's say 3-5 Weeks ago I *think* I feel in love for first time, I was 19. She has boyfriend so I don't even want to see her. But there was huge problem for me every time i thought about love or something similar i wanted to puke, no joke I almost puked way too many times, but after few days life became normal like usual.

Now i'm 20, after my hb I just stopped caring, I was really good student didn't even skipped school. But now I haven't been to school for 1,5 weeks. And the puking is coming back for no reason, but not as strong as it was. I feel like I lost motivation, fun and how to smile, getting worse vision, it's hard to concentrate on one thing. I'am getting easily exhausted, walking  2x slower than I usually did. I'm oversleeping no matter if i go to bed early, I still oversleep school. Also I'm listening to the one song like crazy obsessed, because it puts me at ease for some reason, even when i met up with my friends I still listen to the same song. Even when I'm going to sleep I listen to the same music. Don't know if it helps me or does it makes it worse. I started smoking 1 pack of cigs in a day,  usually 1 pack of cigs lasted about 4-5days.

I feel emotionally unstable, like my eyes get teary for no reason.  


I think I have fever lately, and don't understand if it's hot outside or cold. 

Lately i been thinking it would be nice to not feel anything, like lock all the feelings, emotions. And have peace. If u know how to lock emotions tell me ;3

I have suicidal thoughts, bcz i'm ur typical normie but i'm hanging there by small thread, I don't have courage to do something to my body.

I don't even know why tf i'm writing here. Oh, I think I know why am I writing here. Wanna be my friend? that could backstab so it would help cut that tiny thread, or ignore this post like usually i'm ignored which would put more weight and that thread wouldn't be able to support the weight.

I had ""depression"" 1-2 years ago, talked to my bestfriend made it better and it was gone not long after that. but that was like lvl 1, now i feel like it's lvl 5. Oh u say talk to my bf agian, but last night when I went to him I was afraid to show my back, when he let me go first inside.

I don't wanna see any doctors, because if i actually had depression then it would only make it worse. (like totally im not afraid of seeing docs... I wouldn't even know where to go)

I hope somebody helps to get rid of that thread. TY.

Go to school, Get a job, Settle down, Start a Family and so on ... well I’m a fucking piece of shit and already started fucking up my whole life and I wanna take it back I mean for god sake I don’t even have someone I can express this crisis too I gotta go on the Internet and spill my heart out to feel content with how I’m feeling and I’m feeling fucking overwhelmed. like no one cares right? no dude, no one fucking cares and that’s when I go back to my first statement why am I here anyways? to do drugs, to have an abusive “boyfriend” that can give less of a fuck when u wake up in the middle of the night crying because you’re overthinking everything you scared yourself wide awake?

I feel unimportant.,"Not the first time I'm going through this of course, but recently it hit really hard. Like everything. I'm feeling extremely sad and tired. I want to die. Like genuinely. I feel like my life on this earth is insignificant and useless. I'm realizing I'm not happy with myself. I try to change but no matter how much I do, I can't seem to feel happy....about anything. My friends are disappearing one by one, school is getting harder and harder by the day, my anxiety has entered its way into mind, and dark thoughts cloud over anything bright. I just can't. I want to die, but I also fear what will happen after. I'm scared that maybe in the future things will get better, but because I'm dead I'll miss out. But also keep asking myself why does that matter? And the crazy thing is...my life isn't bad. Because even if I lost a few friends in my life, I also still have a lot of good ones. I have a lovely mother that cares deeply about me. I have some kind of passion that keeps me driven. So do I feel down. Because mentality, I'm unhappy. Because my friends don't trust me to tell me important things. Because I love my mom, but I want to get back on good terms with my dad to. Because I have passions yet I can't seem to pick up the pencil and write, draw, dream.  I hate this feeling. I wish I lived in my own world personalized just for me. It would be so much easier. I look at others and wonder what it's like to be like them. What is it like to be popular, associate yourself with everyone. What is it like to have a boyfriend and experience your first kiss. What is it like to have good grades in all classes. What is it like to be normal...I just want to feel worthy. I want to feel important. I want to feel genuinely happy in my life. In all honesty, I'm just really lonely. Love from your parents are great, but love from the people around you like your friends are so much more to me. Like it's expected of parents to love their kid(s), but when a friend loves you, it means something. At least for me. I'm 9th grade, only 14. I have so many years ahead of me that I'm looking forward to. But I'm always looking back on the past and never wondering or dreaming about the future.

I have tried everything.,"I'm not happy, I feel alone while completely surrounded by people who love me. I read everything my boyfriend texts me the wrong way and feel as if he's constantly angry at me so i uust avoid telling him how i feel. I feel like a failure in my job, a failure with money a failure in general.
My therapy got cancelled because I missed two sessions (one because my appendix burst and the other because i had a breakdown and couldn't leave the house). I feel stagnant and unloved and stupid for thinking this way because theres no reason to why I should think like this.
Im at a loss.
I need someone to talk to, I can't outright ask for attention from anyone because then I'll be needy. I just have to keep plodding on but I cant plod on. I am trying and it is hurting me.
I wish i wasnt around anymore, I really do.

This is unfair,"(I'm not a native english speaker, sorry for all the grammatical errors) 

I feel like I'm a fucking idiot and that the only reason I succeeded at school was because I was working hard, until now. I'm in my first year of college and the second semester started about a month ago but I feel like everything is falling appart. Two teachers barked at me while strongly implying that I was fucking dumb, I studied for several hours for a test and I ended up failing miserably while most of the class (who didn't study at all) found the test super easy. The worse thing is that the place I'm studying at wasn't even the one my high school teachers recommended me to go, thinking it was ""too easy"" for me, but I went to study here anyway because I felt like I wouldn't psychologically handle the option my high school teachers were recommending me to go to (in fact the day before my math finals in hs I was paralyzed on my bed for more than 30min and couldn't stop cyring thinking I wouldn't pass it despite the days I spent studying it). So currently I feel like that I'm just a dumb idiot and that everyone else is simply smarter than me, and the sole reason as to why I succeeded until now was because I cared about my grades but many didn't. I don't know what to do, I don't even know if I even deserve to post something here, I find myself ridiculous and I'm starting to skip meals.",its_me_templar,0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/fdu6xw/this_is_unfair/,native english speaker sorry grammatical error feel like fucking idiot reason succeeded school wa wa working hard first year college second semester started month ago feel like everything falling appart two teacher barked strongly implying wa fucking dumb studied several hour test ended failing miserably class study found test super easy worse thing place studying even one high school teacher recommended go thinking wa easy went study anyway felt like psychologically handle option high school teacher recommending go fact day math final h wa paralyzed bed 30min stop cyring thinking pas despite day spent studying currently feel like dumb idiot everyone else simply smarter sole reason succeeded wa cared grade many know even know even deserve post something find ridiculous starting skip meal,unfair,templar

I feel like I have been LARPIng as ok - will SSRIs help?,"Basically I’ve always been a little listless and sad, even in elementary school. I got ok grades, didn’t really excel at sports. I started getting really great grades in college and joined a magazine, volunteered for the local Democrats, had a barista job etc. But still, even when I was seen as “ok” I was miserable. But, I have a lot of friends, I am kind and funny and have a nice time speaking to people. 

Now I’m three years out of post grad and I’m really suffering. I have been a poor performer at every job I’ve done post grad from the internship, agency, to the tech job I have right now. I have been put on a 30 day performance review and probably getting fired.

I don’t know what I want to do. I don’t know why I make these mistakes and fuck up my entire life. I feel like I’m broken, how will I ever make money?? I’m really on my own. I have rent and bills to pay. I could get another job, but I can’t deal with sucking and getting fired at the next one. 

I am on Prozac now so I am hoping this will help. I feel like being up for being fired was a wake up call. I am so ashamed I let this happen.

Everyone else says I’ll get back on my feet but I’m really not ok and I have no idea what to do.

Someone killed my dog and I’m tired,"I’ve been posting here a lot recently, but it’s better then bothering my friends which is why I have. I feel bad because it probably seems like I am searching for some kind of attention, but I’m not I’m just so depressed and done with everything that I have no where else to turn. I used to text those crisis hotlines, but they never help anymore. They’re all trained to recite the same things, and it’s aggravating having the same conversation over and over again where it doesn’t really feel like my feelings are really being validated. 

Everyone goes through things. I know that as much as the next person. The world is a cruel yet charming place filled with a mixture of amazing people and people who couldn’t give two shits about others. I hate how complicated the world is, and I hate how the good things people do never seems to lessen the bad things. I have turned into such a cynical person and as time goes on I’ve found it harder and harder to see good in the world past some amazing friends and the unconditional love that animals provide. After someone killed my beloved dog though, everything just feels bleak again. He didn’t deserve the death he got, and it angers me that nobody even wants to put in the time to find out who would have done this to my best friend. “It won’t bring him back”, you’re right. It won’t, but maybe it would settle this raging anger I have inside? Maybe it would help me feel less guilty about the fact I wasn’t there for him because I was too busy fucking around in college? He gave me everything, and I gave him loneliness while someone brutally murdered him. 

I can never understand why I feel this way, and why everything in my life is going to shit. I’m so very tired and done with the world. When my mom died March 2019, I thought that was what finally broke me, but then I started to get better. I went to counseling, I leaned on my friends, and I started to cope better. I honestly thought that everything was finally looking up, but the world likes to put people like me back in their place. The more I think about it, the more I consider the fact that I’m probably meant for misery and this is why the world constantly kicks me back down when I start to get back on my feet. Coming home for spring break was a mistake as well. My father has done nothing but make me feel worse inside, and I have done nothing but be a recluse in my room watching Netflix. I have started to draw away from my support system too, not because they’ve done anything wrong but because I am tired of bothering them and they all have their own things going on in life without me coming around to be the depressed sack of shit that I am. 

I wish I hadn’t failed my suicide attempts in the past. I wish I was selfish, naive, and brave enough to try again. I wish I didn’t feel these things inside. Everyone would probably be better off without me anyway. My mom would be alive, my sweet baby would be alive, because I guarantee it was karma towards me that took them away.

I'm fine became an instant response,"Hello everyone. I'm sorry for taking your time, but I need help. 

A bit of a back story to my life: I come from a not-so-well-off family, mom left me (9at the time) and my sister (14 at the time)in my father's care (she left the country), to earn more so we could at least have a bread on the table. My sister took her frustrations on me, was being bullied at school gor not having a functional family, my father distanced himself from us... life generally sucked. I was also getting (at the time undiagnosed) migraines, which my sis and dad kept insisting that I'm lying about for attention, was even punished for it. So I stoped talking. After a long 2 years, my mother had applied for divorce, mainly due to my father's threats and mental abuse. By what I saw, my father was threatening my mother to throw me and my sis in the streets if she didn't send more money. The divorce was messy and a lot of shit throwing at eachother. It ended with my sis insisting that we need to stick toghether and since she was older, she insisted that we stay in my home country with my dad, also to spite my mother, who she now hated. The next years were rough, a lot of screaming, bullying, hitting, starving... list is long. (Just on a side note, I ended up climbing trees from windows to grab aome nasty fruit for my class mates and trading them and homework for sandwiches. Did I care I was millimeters away from dying, NAH!) Highschool was worse with the bulying, mom was still away but now, she had someone (she met the guy before the divorce, but I can't blame her. She was alone in a country where my people were, and still are, very hated). We tried to get mom to get cuatody of me, but for reasons I still can't wrap my head around, it failed. Well, her (now) husband lost his crap, and kept repeating to me and making me feel like pure shit because the process failed. It did fail because of me, yes, but as I said previously, I still don't remember why I said what I said and what happened. Years later, they decide to go to a better place, Australia! After 4 years of struggles and 3 lost cases, I finally get to get my (20 y/o) ass there with my mother. I get a boyfriend, her husband turns out to be the dickhead of the year and, long story short, I get kicked out of the house after only 1 year living with them, and end up with extremely severe anxiety because of him.

This year I turned 24. I still live with my boyfriend, who took me in. But here is where the problem is. I want to end it. So much stuff is going on, and all I can say is that it's too much. I was diagnosed (discovered by accident) with clinical depression at the age of 16, and was never addressed. I always felt like something was wrong, but every time I tried to look for help, was told to suck it up by the counselors and psycologists (admittedly, I only worked the courage to go 3 times in my life).

But in the past 3 years, I felt lost. I've been depressed and can't seem to get over it. I find no joy in life or any of the things I used to love. I have no reason, energy or motivation to move on. I drive to work, I work, put a fake smile, drive back, sleep, agrue, sleep, repeat. I feel so angry all the time, I ended hating myself more than ever, and I don't know why! I feel my partner is not there, he's stuck in his games and not engaging, and I think this is because I put too much pressure on him. I can't see my mother to talk to her, my sister doesn't talk to me and I had to go full no contact with my father. And whenever anyone asks me how I am, all I can do is repeat ""I'm fine"" and smile. I hate it... I hate it all....

Sorry for putting this all out, but I had enough of this. I want to smile, to enjoy things, but I can't... I need help. I knew I had to write this after I watched some reddit reading and was crying like an idiot at how accurate and true the things said in said reading were (the topic was ""What do you wish more people knew about depression"")

Grief Therapy/Process Group,"Another thing. My mom recommended I consider a grief therapy group or just a normal therapy group. I don't think I'm still grieving but I might be. I was in a process group many times, but I only sometimes felt okay with it.

Some of the others had an idea of what I deal with, as far as crippling depression and at the time, a bad home life. But they didn't have DID or BPD. At this point it's either one 🤦‍♂️. And the therapists, it didn't seem like they really knew how to help, like maybe they have had a personality case before but not on my level. 

I'm actually considering getting back into a group. Who knows, maybe this time they can actually help. I'm trying to not be so closed off. That's how it gets worse. Start shifting personalities and when I interact with my mom or anyone calling me, it's me but not me. Hope that makes sense.

You got this!,"I’m sure that a ton of your day is ruined by your head that always screams you’re not good enough or that you messed up. I know there’s something in your mind that always pushes and locks away the good values of yourself, so you can only see the negatives. I know something like that is there. 

I also know that I’m just another person behind a screen, casually typing away whilst you decide to read this. Well, I love you. Like, I love you so bad and to lose someone like you would break my heart, it’s okay to cry, it’s okay to feel bad, it’s okay to feel like giving up. But hey, I want to let you know that you’re still here. And if you’re sitting here, wanting it to be your final hours, then I’m glad that I still get to talk to you and tell you that I adore every part of you; every smile you’ve ever made, tear you’ve cried, every part of you from your head to toe makes me uncontrollably happy. 

I know you’re beautiful, happy or sad, excited or angry. You’re the most beautiful person to you, you want to know why? Because you’ve been going on for so long that you’ve shaped yourself, and you can never be wrong about yourself. You’re the most talented and awesome person I’ve met. And you continue to amaze me everyday by how you manage to wake up day after day, even with the dreaded feeling that you can’t do it, you’re so amazing that I can’t even begin to wonder why you don’t want to be here.

I'm so inconsistent on what I can and can't do. I feel like a liar.,"I can do errands and generally go to work. I can make myself go to therapy for now. I'm exhausted the whole time, and it's hard to concentrate, but I can do it. I will admit I've called into work 7 or 8 times this year though. I usually only call in once or twice a year. Whoops. 


So I can generally do what I need to do. I can't cook or maintain my personal hygiene though. I've just been microwaving leftovers that someone else made or eating fast food. I haven't showered in 4 weeks. I only brush my teeth once a day, and even then it's half-assed. I haven't brushed my hair in a few days. I lay around when I'm not running errands/working/going to therapy and it makes my body sore as hell.

Dear mods, if this is not the right place, kindly let me know. If would be great if you could direct me to the right subreddit.

English is not my first language so please bear with me.

**TL:DR**
I have done a lot of reading when I procrastinate from work. I want to start a daily journal on reddit to keep track of my positives and negatives, my progress, and hopefully get advices on when I go wrong. 
I noticed that I get overtly stressed over tiny chores/work/things to do, and I'd like to tackle it via progressive increase in exposure and desensitization. Then incorporate other CBT techniques.

***Story/Background:***

I have only recently been diagnosed with Major Depressive Disorder after a close friend forced me to. Looking back now, I think I first had mild depression around 16yo.
I recall having a general apathy towards life, results, ambition, family, and friends. Any motivation is fleeting and I'd spend most of my days daydreaming. Perhaps hoping for some catastrophe in the school so that I'm no longer bored.
The depression seemingly subsided - at least I think so - as I continued on aimlessly on some path my family/culture/friends expected of me. while I'm not excelling, I'm not underperforming. I have close group of friends and we enjoy movies and outings.
It all went to hell when I was around 22/23yo. I should add that I have Contamination OCD and during my University days, decided against my better judgement that I should live with a close friend.
This proved horrible as my OCD meant I couldn't live normally or telerate their habits. I thought I had it in control and hid my oddities well. I didn't. 

My housemates at the time hated me and talked loads behind my back. All the while I was oblivious about their hatred towards me while they acted normal around me. I noticed somewhere around 3 months in. I had the chance to look through their messages and curiousity started my depression.
Reading through all those hate filled complaints and messages was painful. Having to sleep in the same room as him after was impossivle. To act civil while I moved out was tough. While we did not have a big fight because we both hated confrontation,
our 6year friendship fell apart; along with it, I resolutely cut ties with the entire group of friends that was associated with this guy. 

I believe this to be the ""event"" which kickstarted my depression. Worse still, I moved to a different place and had another falling out with another group of housemates. We started off great, even went on a trip together. In about two months, I don't recall the cause of it. But I remember they confronted me on something and I just started withdrawing from them. 
After that, I stopped going to lectures and classes. I was fired from my club because I couldn't perform anymore. (I spent the first year making it into the committee), As a result, I graduated with a subpar GPA. I've never felt worse. I feel like I disaappointed my dad, wasted his money, and failed to prove myself to those who looked down on me.
I spent the next two years isolating myself in my room, only going out for groceries if I absolutely have to. I avoided the housemates by being active at odd hours. I lied to my family that I was trying and failing to apply for jobs while the truth is I mindlessly watched seasons after seasons of brainless TV. 
I am eternally thankful that my dad supported me through this lie. He paid for my rent, food, and courses I took because I wanted to extend my visa. Oh, I was also an international student so you can imagine how much money that costed. 
I cannot begin to describe the amount of guilt I feel. 

The reason I'm even trying to get better is because of guilt. My main motivation is to make them proud of me.

When I was 27, I spent a year dodging their concerned calls. They were so worried they sent a friend over to check on me. And finally, they took a flight over themselves. My visa finally expired and I went home.
After getting home, I once again lied to them about job searching and spent a year doing my best to avoid family events and outings. Finally, last year they forcefully got me a job with my relatives and I've feel into a routine since then.
I majored in Finance and Accounting in Uni. But my results were subpar and it has been 3-4years at this point. I barely remember a thing and I can't perform. I can't even get myself to pick the knowledge back up. 
Admittedly though, the work I perform doesn't require that much. But alas, I fail to perform. I find it difficult to get myself to issue a simple invoice which takes 5muinutes tops. 

I am more and more disappointed in myself over time. I hate the job, but I haven't even sent out a single resume. The very thought of going for interviews and exposing myself as incompetent frightens me. GEtting judged by anonymous HR people makes me hate myself.
I contemplated all kinds of alternatives ie: getting a remote part time job so that I can make extra income while improving myself. Taking courses online and hopefully put me ahead of others.
Ultimately though, I have not brought myself to do any of those things. Even this reddit post took 5days of contemplating before I could do it.

I know what I should do, and people will say ""you never know if you never try"" but I can't help but imagine the negatives. Posting for help on reddit for example opens me up to judgement from random strangers, trolls, even scams, some of them incredibly damaging. 
Improving myself via courses/books/lectures can be an enormous time sink. Not to mention that what is learned may not even be useful to me in the future and may end up being a waste of time.
Currently, I spend the measly 4 hours of free time I get after getting back from work watching movies or reading novels. They're not entertaining nor boring, but they keep me sane. I dread the day that they are taken away. 


***Analysis:***

Growing up, I've been instilled with the idea that I am smart, but lazy. I believe this became a part of my core identify. I'm 29 and I don't recall ever working hard, for anything. 
I've coasted through life however, largely because my parents made me go to numerous additional tuitions, cram classes, etc. I've never done homework, mostly copied them off of friends, but have the concept repeated to you enough times and it gets carved into memory.
My results up till 15yo were always above average. 

I believe due to the circumstances, I grew up without developing any self-discipline skills. Never having an aim or goal and simply going through the motions meant I was lost the moment those guidance were taken away. Believing myself to be smart also creates a subconcious anxiety - what if I worked hard but still failed? that would mean I'm not smart.

Throughout life, I have had a panic attack twice. Once when I was 10. An art project which took me 20minutes tops was criticised and I broke down in tears and hyperventilated, having to be taken home from school.
The next was when I was 16. Around this time, I was getting progessively more apathetic at school. I struggled to get up in the morning and was often late to school. I was late for 10 times and my parents were called to school which resulted in me hyperventilating once again.
I also spent a lot of time gaming which I believe was some sort of coping mechanism similar to mindlessly watching youtube or browsing reddit. 

Not entirely sure what these events mean. But I think I can conclude that I have an inability to accept criticism or face consequences of my own actions. 

***What I want to do:***

As stated above, I want to tackle my self-disclipline, responsibility avoidance, and anxiety towards work, via progressively increasing exposure. 
I will practice mindful relaxation and attempt to associate the relaxation with the trigger(work).
I will also journal on reddit. 1. To have accountability, 2. to further dissect my thoughts, analyze the issues, solve them. and 3. to get advice.

Rock Bottom,"So I’ve suffered some heavy depression for a long time, my ex that I absolutely loved to the max just got along so well, she was so gorgeous, caring, loving and nice. She was the first girl I actually loved in a long long time. Me and her were so good for each other I thought. She knew I was suffering from depression but the crazy part is every day I was with her I was improving. She was the support I used to slowly walk up the steps to getting better. I was happy as can be to have a girl like that and for myself to climb out of that depressed hole I was in for so long. Well we got into an argument before our breakup because I thought we were being pretty distant and she blew up. She told me “I just can’t handle it anymore” and left me, I was heartbroken. She couldn’t handle my depression anymore and that’s what hurt the most. I loved her with my whole heart and now she looks at me like I’m some stranger on the streets. She never truly explained to me why everything happened and she won’t talk to me at all now. I thought I was making us stronger by opening up to her and having her help me but she never told me how much I was hurting her with my depression. She saw me improve so much and deciding to leave outta no where made no sense to me. Well here we are today, all that progress lost. I feel worse than I ever have in my life. It really fucking hurts to know the one person I loved most couldn’t handle me at my worst and left me to rot. I don’t even know what to do. I’ve deadass just been hooking up with girls at parties and drinking with my friends until I blackout. I don’t know if I can trust another girl with any of my emotions again or even trust myself to love someone again. I just wanted to give her the world but I ruined it for her and us. I’m a piece of shit I know, but i just want her to see that I was improving and for her to come back.",thebiggens,12,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/fdngxg/rock_bottom/,suffered heavy depression long time ex absolutely loved max got along well wa gorgeous caring loving nice wa first girl actually loved long long time good thought knew wa suffering depression crazy part every day wa wa improving wa support used slowly walk step getting better wa happy girl like climb depressed hole wa long well got argument breakup thought pretty distant blew told handle anymore left wa heartbroken handle depression anymore hurt loved whole heart look like stranger street never truly explained everything happened talk thought wa making u stronger opening help never told much wa hurting depression saw improve much deciding leave outta made sense well today progress lost feel worse ever life really fucking hurt know one person loved handle worst left rot even know deadass hooking girl party drinking friend blackout know trust another girl emotion even trust love someone wanted give world ruined u piece shit know want see wa improving come back,rock bottom,big gen

No motivation in job related issues,"I would like to share my situation here presumming this has already been talked about a thousand times. First of all, forgive my English as it is not my first language (Im from Spain).

Im a 26 yo civil engineering, graduated in 2018 after 5 long years of hard study. Before this, I did a couple internships in civil engineering during college. The second one went pretty good and my boss actually wanted to hire me but I decided to leave to start the masters. After finishing it one year later and not finding any job, I ended up in an energy company, in the sales department, a field totally different than my educational background, where I stayed temporarily until I could find something in my field. The thing is, several months have passed and Im still here but also I found out I dont like this job, to the point that it has driven to a state of depression and unhappiness, but still here because of the money. The situation has been aggravated since I cant find anything else, resulting in a feel of no motivation to find other jobs and challenge myself to reach higher in life. Also, I feel that Im not as competent as I should be and that makes me feel bad too. Times is passing and Im still stuck in this conundrum with the pressure of no succeeding. I know this relies in the survival of the fittest and work hard concept but it seems to be more difficult for me. The only times I feel an extra shoot of happiness is when I practice sports or Im with my girlfriend/friends. But then this bleak mental state hits back again.

Wonder if any of you have experienced a similar situation and how have you dealt with it.

How I’ve been,"What started as a week phase(on and off) in September of 2019 has slowly becoming more and more permanent. My eyes feel tired, I feel physically exhausted. I can’t focus, I can’t find enjoyment out of guitar and video games (things I used to put hours a day into).  So now I sleep. I sleep in my free periods at school and I sleep when I get home at 2:30pm. I wake up around 8pm, eat and go back to bed. My dreams are starting to be better then my own life. While I dream I feel happy, I don’t feel weighed down. I don’t feel like I’m alone. I don’t feel numb. 

I went to the school counselor for help last week. All she told me was to tell my mom how I was feeling and go see a doctor. That is the hardest thing I can possibly do. She will think it’s her fault, similar to how she took my sisters anxiety problem, and I can’t burden that on her. I don’t know what to do.

I forgot about music.,"Hi everyone, this is my first time posting in this thread so bare with me. 

So I’ve been suffering from depression on and off for years, I’m currently in an off cycle but feel kind of down/low energy but not enough for me to call it depressed. Anyway, I somehow completely forgot about music and haven’t listened to it for months. I commute on the bus, and I usually just sit and browse reddit, and when my bf drives me the radio is usually off because I get sensory overload if he tries to talk while the radio is on, so we usually just keep it off. 

Anyway, yesterday when I went in the car the Bluetooth function was on as I guess my bf was listening to his music on his way home from work, and it automatically connected to my phone and started playing my music. It was a song by the Jonas brothers (embarrassing) from like 2008, and it just made me so so happy and I started vibing so hard before I had to start work. I seriously forgot about music. I told him now that every time he drives me to work I should play my music to give me a quick happy boost before work.

Yesterday I was reminded again.,"Exactly a year ago, I turned up at my gf's (now ex) house. She wanted to be angry with me that day, she was walking towards me about to explode.... But I picked her up and ran away with her. She forgot even why she wanted to be angry with me for, we went IKEA to look at new stuff for her apartment and then we went to a cafe in which I took a selfie of us. We were so happy and cute together. That selfie popped up on my one year memories.

Fast forward to now, we've been separated since end of October last year. She doesn't talk with me, she removed me from everything except Facebook. 

I am hurting every fucking day. I remember her, I remember all the good times we had, I remember the future plans we had with each other. I don't know exactly when she turned from loving me to leaving me. But I just wish she spoke to me about any concerns she was having. I made my mistakes too by not understanding exactly what she wanted. 

I just want that happiness we had a year ago. I just miss her so much. We both wanted to get married, but I told her, once I finish school or get a job, we will get married! 

She told me she loved me and always will. I told her I loved her unconditionally. I wish somehow we could redo our relationship because we fit together so damn well.

My birthday is Saturday,"As the title says, my birthday is Saturday. The past 20 years I've never had a good birthday. My Mom was never stable, and my birthday was no exception. She'd would either view my birthday as a burden or if I didn't react in a specific way to something she would do for my birthday, she'd act as if the world collapsed around her and make a huge deal about how I don't appreciate her and she's a bad parent. (Maybe I'm just un-greatful like I've always been told) Regardless. As far back as I can remember, I've never had a good birthday. I recall vividly having a birthday party as a child, no one wanted to really play with me at my party. And I tried to isolate myself at a table when the cake was being cut (it didn't go over well with my Mom, she scalded me in front of everyone).

 As birthdays go by, all I remember are sighs, moans, and groans whenever mentioned. Last year no one wished me a happy birthday (family yes, but if history shows they don't really care) my Mom said I should celebrate her on my birthday because she's the one that gave birth to me.
 Later on I went to a pub I knew I could get into, and tried to get drunk but could barley manage. I had never felt so alone in a room of people, and it's not like it's a place I'm unfamiliar with, I knew the regulars, the regulars knew me, we're all well aquatinted. Yet still, I had never felt more alone. I ended up contacting a mate that sells me pot and got high with my weed guy. He's the only person that genuinely wished me a Happy Birthday outside my family.

 Flashforward to present day, life is pretty decent, my business is doing well, I have an album releasing soon, I have a clean bill of health (for the most part) but the realization set in...

My friend (we'll call him J) is talking in the group chat I'm in,  saying he wants to do social stuff soon, and I tell him that (we'll call him B) B and I are going to do stuff Friday and we could go out and do something all together. The chat goes cold. 

Time passes. 

Moments later, someone else in the chat (we'll call him C) says ""we should all do something Friday""...everyone lights up with agreeing with him. B then enters the chat and says my birthday is Saturday and ""we should be going out Friday for Matt"". C responds with ""that's fine"". Then everything hits me, I feel like a burden again, they probably didn't want to hangout with me, and now that B said something they feel obligated... 

I told them  ""We don't have to for me"" ""I would rather you guys have a full night"". The chats been silent since. I'm a burden, people probably hangout with me because they feel morally obligated. I'm just a waste of space.

 I'm probably being over dramatic and acting like a child seeking attention. But I know this post will waste away in the void. Nothing is genuine.

During my time at home I couldn't stop myself from crying. I stayed in my room all day, not leaving for food or the bathroom. I just sat there and thought about ending it.

I couldn't just leave.

[Advice please] I feel like I'm stuck in fog and I can't work out which way to go,"Hi, 

First post on this sub in a while but I'm at a loss of what to do

I'm so fed up of feeling numb and tired and like I don't want to exist and my brain is so fogged that I cant think straight

I'm trying everything - taking the pills, doing the therapy, seeking advice and just nothing seems to be helping

I don't like my job, but I also don't want to resign without anything else lined up and all of the experts and forums and advice systems just suggest trying to 'think in a more positive manner' and I'm really trying but it just feels hopeless, I get 5 minutes of 'maybe this will be OK!' then immediately back to the grey reality

I've started applying for new jobs as my current manager has suggested that we get through year end then if I'm still feeling the same way then perhaps I should look elsewhere

so I kind of don't see the point in actually trying until year end as if I'm not staying then who am I impressing?

I have a 1:1 later so I guess I'll find out if it's time to leave

&amp;#x200B;

has anyone had this ? can anyone help?

sorry just a brain dump

I’ve never had this painful/angry feeling more in my heart than right now,"I (20 m) may or may not have depression and if I do it’s very mild, however that being said I feel this pain because I messed up the future I had with the girl I seriously would’ve hand crafted. I was madly in love with her but long distance made it not work in the end, I don’t have a problem moving on, but what’s hurts more than the break up did is finding out within a couple of months she’s met another guy, flew to him, and is planning on moving in with him. This could’ve so easily been me and her it’s painful. When we were together in person I can easily say that was the happiest 2 weeks of my life. Now I get it most people will think “just find someone else” but like some others I assume I am extremely picky. And then people will be like “just don’t be as picky” and my response is I will never be as happy with someone if I settle for less.

How do I deal with parents that basically just punish me for being depressed?,"Because I am so tired of this shit. I've tried to sit them down and explains syuff to them. It didn't work. Never works. 

They don't outright say that they're punishing me because I'm depressed, but the things I do or don't do because I'm depressed get punished. I have bad grades, I'm failing in almost everything. I'm trying but with depression is really hard. You know what I get for trying? My phone and videogames taken away. I can't fall asleep at night because of anxiety. You know what I get for having nightly panic attacks? Yelled at for ""staying up all night."" You know what I get for having trouble keeping my room clean? Grounded. 

Tommorow I'm losing my phone because my grades are bad. Ignore the fact that I'm trying, yeah let's only care about a damn letter of the alphabet because THAT makes more sense than a flippin living person! t(-_-  )t

I don't even like my phone that much. I'm not one of those people who are super addicted or nothing. But my phone is a coping mechanism. Without being able to vent or watch some relaxing video to calm me down I'm probably just gonna end up cutting myself.

"I tried falling in love, now I'm even more broken","I'm 24 years old. I've consisrently failed at pursuing all my dreams. A year or so ago I broke up with my ex girlfriend. I met her 2-3 years ago, memory is getting foggy, I'm sure y'all understand. Before that I was lied to, cheated on by the few other girls I'd been with. She dropped into my life out of nowhere. I met her online and at first we were both apprehensive... I didn't want to get hurt more but she was there for me. She helped me see therapists for my disorders, she helped me get out of bed and go to work every morning. We lived in different timezones and she would stay up through the night to wake me up in the morning to hear my voice. I fell in love with her. She said she loved me too. I flew her to where I lived and she took two weeks off her work which she takes seriously. She maintained she loved me, things were even better than she had hoped. After she left everything started slowly crumbling. I was getting worse without her and she couldn't deal. She couldn't deal being away from me, according to her, and I could see my disorders were bringing her down, even when I was on antidepressants. She eventually broke up with me. And it's been a year, and I'm living with someone else. She's living with someone else too. I don't feel anything anymore guys... I just try to not cry every day. I'm not fucking happy. I miss her and we text occasionally, she knows what she wants, and it's not me. I've lost interest in even sex now, worse than with the SSRIs. I really don't know how to keep going. I tried moving on, I tried changing homes, I tried pursuing passions but everything just falls short. I feel like I'm just pretending I care about things in hope that I eventually will and this torture will end. I just hope I don't have to live this fucking broken.",saurus99,1,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/fdr55d/i_tried_falling_in_love_now_im_even_more_broken/,24 year old consisrently failed pursuing dream year ago broke ex girlfriend met 2 3 year ago memory getting foggy sure understand wa lied cheated girl dropped life nowhere met online first apprehensive want get hurt wa helped see therapist disorder helped get bed go work every morning lived different timezones would stay night wake morning hear voice fell love said loved flew lived took two week work take seriously maintained loved thing even better hoped left everything started slowly crumbling wa getting worse without deal deal away according could see disorder bringing even wa antidepressant eventually broke year living someone else living someone else feel anything anymore guy try cry every day fucking happy miss text occasionally know want lost interest even sex worse ssri really know keep going tried moving tried changing home tried pursuing passion everything fall short feel like pretending care thing hope eventually torture end hope live fucking broken,tried falling love even broken,urus 99

I just want it all to end,"Last year i got done with my senior highschool year and despite working soo hard for since june till the next june, studying hours daily i ended up falling short of the percentage i needed to enter the major i wanted to which is computer science and let myself and my family down. I had to major in finances since it was my only choice and i am hating it. Moreover i am hating the fact that i am living with myself as a failure, i never achieve anygoals that i want and i never get anywhere. I have OCD which i am taking medication and therapy for and it has been kicking in so hard lately with all the negativity making me go crazy. I am always depressed and my family is disappointed from me. I just feel like a burden now on every body around me i always have breakdowns and my family always blasts me for it. All my relatives are engineers and other good majors and jobs and i am stuck in this. i am sorry if my writing isnt organized but i am so disoriented right now. I feel like if i just die i would relief every body around me from my burden and relief them from the shame of having me. I cant stand living with my self knowing that i an a complete and utter failure. I dont deserve anything. I will never get anywhere in life i just want it all to end. i just want to die i cant live with myself anymore. And it is a relief knowing that when i die no one will care as i dont want to hurt anyone. I have no friends, my family wish they didnt have me. My relatives didnt even care to call or visit me when i was hospitalized after a cycling accident. I just wish to die and be forgotten instead of living in misery and burdening my family. I dont want to kill my self because i am a bit religious and suicide is prohibited in my religion but i wish i could. I just want to die i cant live anymore. I hate my self. I hate seeing my self in the mirror every morning.I hatr waking up and knowing i am still alive. i cry my self to sleep every might wishing i never wakeup again but i still do.

“What degree are you graduating with?”

“Is there good money in that? Enough to buy a home?” 

Then she says 

“It doesn’t matter what degree you get, if you become an engineer, or how much money you plan on getting.  You’ll be dead so early that you won’t be able to even attempt to achieve or enjoy any of it”

the only thing keeping me alive is my plan to die in 2 weeks,"I really cannot do this anymore. It's like my suffering has spread onto those I love and I'm at a point where I can no longer put on a fake smile. I can no longer pretend that I'm okay because I'm not. I  hate seeing my friends and family hurt for me and it breaks my heart seeing them feel so helpless.

My life is such a failure and I've already ruined it so much that there's literally no point in going on. I fall asleep crying every night because I realized that I'm the problem here and my existence only makes the lives of others worse. People keep telling me how much they love me and how much I have to live for and while that does mean something to me, it's not enough to make me want to live. With my existence, I hurt people and with my death, I'll hurt people, so what's the point? At least if I die eventually the hurt will begin to fade (or so I hope). I just want the people I love to live a life without worries or hurt and all I do is hurt them. 

I have 2 more weeks to finish this quarter of school. Before I decide to end my ""wonderful"" life I just want to finish this one quarter, not that I'm going to achieve anything. I just want to push through these last 2 weeks but even that's been extremely difficult.

Why can't I find treatment?,"I was going to a doctor who just wanted to prescribe medication, but none of it seemed to really help. And my previous doctor was the same. I tried with no luck to self refer to some mental health places but nothing panned out. I changed insurance recently and had to switch doctors. They referred me to a place which both me and my doctor were under the impression would handle medication and therapy.

So I scheduled a needs assessment and thought, ""finally."" But after the needs assessment they just wanted to refer me to more places. I tried calling most of them and they were either full with long wait lists, no longer existed(maybe wrong number provided) or no answer.

I called my doctor back and they sent a referral to another place, and told me I should get a call within the week. Its been 3 weeks now and no call.

"No matter which path in life I take, I will be unhappy","I don't know if anyone will even read this, but I need to vent somewhere. For some background, I am now living back in my home state, in an unhappy situation, because I wanted to come back and finish up school and so that I could be around my family.

Originally, I moved away for a few years. I was unhappy before I left my home, and I found real happiness out west in Colorado for a time. I began traveling around, working seasonal jobs at ski resorts and in national parks, and I really enjoyed it for awhile. I just wanted to keep traveling, but then the realities of life set in.

I didn't have a degree, I wasn't in any sort of high-paying jobs, and I was struggling to make it paycheck to paycheck. Despite all of this, I was still relatively happy. Eventually though, I realized that I missed my family and my old friends terribly, and decided to move back so that I could be around them and get an education.

Fast forward to now. I'm 26 years old, living at my dad's house, working in an unfulfilling job that pays terribly, while I wait for my first semester of school to start. I feel like an absolute failure because I won't even have a degree until I'm 30. I won't start my career until almost a decade after everyone else did. I miss what I was doing and the places I traveled through so terribly much. I feel like I'm missing a part of myself by being back here and I left it out west.

I have considered moving back, but I have no idea how I would afford it, and I don't see any career opportunities for me outside of dead-end, low paying jobs out there. Also, if I don't do school now, then I don't think I ever will. If I moved back out, I would just go back to seeing my family once a year for two or three days, and I love them so much. That was the hardest part of being out there, and I want to be able to see them regularly. I'm extremely close to my parents, and I don't want to miss a moment with them, because I realize that they will be gone some day. Every moment with them is precious.

But, I feel like I'm slowly dying here. I am turned into a depressed, cynical person who cannot see the good in life anymore. Everything is negative, and the people around me in this state are so ignorant and offensive. I don't belong here, and I don't know what to do. Grappling with this indecision has been so unbelievably hard on me.

If I stay, then I will just become more and more unhappy. If I leave, then I will never be able to see my parents, and I will be unhappy again because of that. I can't take it anymore. Looking ahead, my life seems like it is going to be one endless stream of depression and I honestly just want it to end.

Changing thought patterns via therapy different than wishing away depression?,"I have never understood the distinction between therapy like CBT which tries to train you to think more positively to reduce or eliminate depression, which is sort of the underlying belief of most psychology thinking, versus the sentiment that one cannot think themselves out of depression.

I (19M) feel like I'm reaching a breaking point.,"I've been feeling depressed af the last few months, it sort of feels like a relapse after about 6 months of a reasonably healthy mental state.

Basically I feel physically drained of energy all day, I have zero motivation to study or try in any way whatsoever in college. I'm doing a notoriously tough course and barely passed my Christmas exams. I come home exhausted but when I go to bed I just become really agitated and irritated. My heart starts pounding and I struggle to breathe, I can't get comfortable and even if go to bed exhausted at 8/9pm I wouldn't get to sleep until 2/3am.  However in the mornings I struggle so much to get out of bed, I feel like there's almost zero point getting up anyway as I wouldn't even miss out on anything. I end up missing so many of my lectures simply becuase I cannot bring myself to get out of bed. I still live at home going to college but if I lived by myself without parents I could see myself just staying in bed/my room for days at a time. 

Every day passes by in a sort of blur for me, I feel like I almost have a depersonalization disorder as I just operate in autopilot. I feel like a shell, it's almost like I'm just empty inside; I don't feel emotions, everything just feels monotonous and numb.  Honestly I really just don't give a fuck about anything anymore. I used to have passions like playing music/sport/reading/films etc but nothing excites me anymore. I feel like I don't really have an emotional outlet, it's like I'm just existing day-to-day without actually living. Since I find close to zero pleasure in general life I self-medicate with weed; I guess it's just a coping mechanism in order to feel something other than numb. I also think I have memory loss, as the last couple months have really blurred, I honestly don't know where the time has gone or what I've been doing in that time. 

I also have really really bad eating habits, I don't generally eat breakfast and then could go the day without eating. However when I come home I often would binge until I struggle to breathe. 

I also feel socially exhausted every day I have to go into college; pretending to be someone I'm not is mentally draining as I feel like I'm putting on a fake persona just to mask the numbness when all I wanna do is just go to bed/get high. This is probably part of the reason I avoid going to lectures. 

This all eventually caused me to go to the student couseling services in my college sometime last week, however I feel like I wasnt as honest as I should have been regarding my situation, I was definitely making it out to be less severe than it actually is. They set me up with counselling sessions that start in 3 weeks. 

However I feel like my ability to function has been severely impaired in the last few days. Tonight I felt the urge to self-harm for the first time and honestly if I had clean razors I would already have done so. I don't think I can wait 3 weeks for my counselling appointment, I feel like I should go to a GP/psychiatrist and see what they think. I feel like I just want someone to tell me exactly what I have, I'm 99% sure it's depression, and perhaps symptomatic  insomnia/a binge eating disorder. I guess part of me still denies it's depression despite me knowing that it almost certainly is and I feel like I need a medical professional to tell me how it is in order for me to be able to work on getting better. I guess I also want to see if they think that medication could help too. Ultimately I just want treatment as soon as possible, something concrete I can show to myself to tell me that I'm taking steps to improve myself as atm I feel so lost in life, and I feel like a breakingpoint might come soon unless I change things. 

I really don't know where to go from here, I guess this post is just a reflection. Maybe I just want to get my thoughts down somewhere but if anyone has any advice obviously I'd rly appreciate that: like most ppl here I just wanna feel normal again. :( If anyone would be willing to talk about things a bit more in detail I'd appreciate a pm.",taway0403,2,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/fdlr0n/i_19m_feel_like_im_reaching_a_breaking_point/,feeling depressed af last month sort feel like relapse 6 month reasonably healthy mental state basically feel physically drained energy day zero motivation study try way whatsoever college notoriously tough course barely passed christmas exam come home exhausted go bed become really agitated irritated heart start pounding struggle breathe get comfortable even go bed exhausted 8 9pm get sleep 2 3am however morning struggle much get bed feel like almost zero point getting anyway even miss anything end missing many lecture simply becuase cannot bring get bed still live home going college lived without parent could see staying bed room day time every day pass sort blur feel like almost depersonalization disorder operate autopilot feel like shell almost like empty inside feel emotion everything feel monotonous numb honestly really give fuck anything anymore used passion like playing music sport reading film etc nothing excites anymore feel like really emotional outlet like existing day day without actually living since find close zero pleasure general life self medicate weed guess coping mechanism order feel something numb also think memory loss last couple month really blurred honestly know time ha gone time also really really bad eating habit generally eat breakfast could go day without eating however come home often would binge struggle breathe also feel socially exhausted every day go college pretending someone mentally draining feel like putting fake persona mask numbness wanna go bed get high probably part reason avoid going lecture eventually caused go student couseling service college sometime last week however feel like wasnt honest regarding situation wa definitely making le severe actually set counselling session start 3 week however feel like ability function ha severely impaired last day tonight felt urge self harm first time honestly clean razor would already done think wait 3 week counselling appointment feel like go gp psychiatrist see think feel like want someone tell exactly 99 sure depression perhaps symptomatic insomnia binge eating disorder guess part still denies depression despite knowing almost certainly feel like need medical professional tell order able work getting better guess also want see think medication could help ultimately want treatment soon possible something concrete show tell taking step improve atm feel lost life feel like breakingpoint might come soon unless change thing really know go guess post reflection maybe want get thought somewhere anyone ha advice obviously rly appreciate like ppl wanna feel normal anyone would willing talk thing bit detail appreciate pm,19m feel like reaching breaking point,away 0403
I don't do anything,"I've got a lot of work to do, but I can't do anything. The voice in my head says that even if I tried, I wouldn't get anywhere, I wouldn't succeed. That's why I always delay things, even though I have to do it at that time. The worst part is that I'm aware of this situation, and I'm still not doing anything about it. Time's going too fast and idk what to do. My anxiety gets worse at times like this and when it gets worse, I can't even sleep, let alone do anything.

I'm so tired of feeling this way, but like I said, I don't know what to do. I don't have anyone to talk to and I really need advice.

Disappointed,"Disappointed
That's the one word I would use to sum up the way I feel. Disappointed in everything. 

Myself, for being...mediocre. That's the only word that comes to mind when I consider my life. I've been given so many gifts and people that love me, and I waste it all. I don't quite understand what's wrong with me, but I know there's something not clicking right in my brain. People talk about a certain fire behind someone's eyes, a drive that pushes them to work hard for their goals. I dont have that. I'm not passionate about anything. I find myself with no motivation to do anything, even doing days without eating. Some days I'll be how I used to, full of energy and making people laugh, but, as quickly as it appeared, it's gone. I'm back to laying in bed all day, not speaking to anyone, not doing anything that I'm not required to. The only thing that impresses me anymore is how easily I lie to my own family. As soon as they call, I become this other person. The person they want me to be, who does well in school and never had any issues. 

I don't feel joy anymore. Not a trace of genuine happiness, other than the aforementioned 'good days'. Even the things that used to make me happiest, like Christmas, now just seem annoying and pointless. I can't sleep, often laying awake for hours on end. 

Fuck, I miss him. I miss my Da. I would give anything in the world for 5 more minutes with him. He was everything to me, my whole world. I loved him with everything in me. You could come to him in the worst possible situation, and he would tell you what you needed to hear, and you would always come away feeling better. But now he's gone. He left, leaving a mess that my family has yet to fix, and now I'll never see him again. Never hug him, or hear his roaring laughter. I'll never again have him look me in the eyes and say ""I'm proud of you, son."" And that breaks my heart. Sometimes I go back and listen to old voicemails, just to hear his voice. 

I'm disappointed in my family, some more than others. We all came together as a family for the funeral, and not even 24 hours later they're already fighting. I don't understand what I have to do to let them know I need help. I shouldn't be too hard on them, but if my friend who hasn't seen me in 3 years can discern I'm struggling over the phone, surely my own family could tell. I told them I wasn't ready to go back, that I couldn't handle it, but they didn't listen. I've never once in my life had real freedom. Freedom to choose what I want. Thats not exactly true. Theres 2 options: do what they want, or be on my own. 

Disappointed in those around me. Now, I could never blame anyone here for my problems, but damn if they can't tell. There are people here who's job it is to identify people who are struggling. They haven't approached me, nor have any of my 'friends' here. I went to the counselor once, and after an hour of talking, he told me that he thought my Das death might have had an impact on me. No shit. Say what you will about my high school, but I'm more comfortable telling anyone there that I'm struggling than I ever would be here. 

I don't know where something went wrong, where I lost my drive, but I want to fix it. I want to be happy again, but every day that seems farther away. Every day, I feel less like myself and I just want it to end.",howdoiexpressemotion,0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/fdrbq9/disappointed/,disappointed one word would use sum way feel disappointed everything mediocre word come mind consider life given many gift people love waste quite understand wrong know something clicking right brain people talk certain fire behind someone eye drive push work hard goal dont passionate anything find motivation anything even day without eating day used full energy making people laugh quickly appeared gone back laying bed day speaking anyone anything required thing impress anymore easily lie family soon call become person person want doe well school never issue feel joy anymore trace genuine happiness aforementioned good day even thing used make happiest like christmas seem annoying pointless sleep often laying awake hour end fuck miss miss da would give anything world 5 minute wa everything whole world loved everything could come worst possible situation would tell needed hear would always come away feeling better gone left leaving mess family ha yet fix never see never hug hear roaring laughter never look eye say proud son break heart sometimes go back listen old voicemail hear voice disappointed family others came together family funeral even 24 hour later already fighting understand let know need help hard friend seen 3 year discern struggling phone surely family could tell told ready go back handle listen never life real freedom freedom choose want thats exactly true 2 option want disappointed around could never blame anyone problem damn tell people job identify people struggling approached friend went counselor hour talking told thought da death might impact shit say high school comfortable telling anyone struggling ever would know something went wrong lost drive want fix want happy every day seems farther away every day feel le like want end,disappointed,doi express emotion
The only time when I feel fine is when I sleep,"When I am awake my anxiety is there every moment, and it can be overwhelming. I feel my heart beating faster and my breathing becomes a mess, I just feel my whole body feel uncomfortable when I am awake. The only time where I don't feel panic, where I don't feel as much negative feelings, is when I lie in bed and my mind is getting ready to sleep. I don't know how long it takes to fall asleep, but if it took 10 minutes, then those 10 minutes is the best I ever felt in the whole day. I know that its not good to sleep so much, but I understand why some people would choose to sleep a lot when they are depressed. I look forward to that peaceful 10 minutes. I wish I could have that feeling throught the day without needing to fall asleep first.",southwestperson,0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/fdraum/the_only_time_when_i_feel_fine_is_when_i_sleep/,awake anxiety every moment overwhelming feel heart beating faster breathing becomes mess feel whole body feel uncomfortable awake time feel panic feel much negative feeling lie bed mind getting ready sleep know long take fall asleep took 10 minute 10 minute best ever felt whole day know good sleep much understand people would choose sleep lot depressed look forward peaceful 10 minute wish could feeling throught day without needing fall asleep first,time feel fine sleep,southwest person
I don't really think if one phrase could even describe how destroyed am I,"I don't even know how to start, I always thought about one thing that always tortures my brain: Everyone are the same, but I am not. When I was a child, being child was the perfect excuse to hide my condition: I don't know how to talk to people, I don't know how to prolong a conversation, I don't know anything about being sociable. In the other hand, I was (and I am) really smart, but I don't really qualify myself about something special, because people are so stupid to think about being self-centered, instead of thinking about the personality itself, that's maybe one of the thing I don't even comprehend about society, well I continue, being able to do whatever you want its something amazing, I felt (I feel) I got the most powerful superpower, being able to think about something interesting to do and make it real, make it like I was professional on something, but if you can't even talk, even express yourself, your brain, all of your amazing ideas are taking down to trash, to something miserable, how much kids, teens worried about the things other people say (I worry too), but I'm 100% sure they can shine if they are with the correct people, ask me, I'm 22 now, in 22 years, Why didn't I find anyone like me?, anyone who I can talk about interesting things and not about superficial and stupid things, anyone who takes the life like a poetry, with right values, anyone who understands me, anyone who I can be myself

I hated my school partners, and they always thought about things on how to ruin my day, I didn't understand why being so small, being so tiny they were so disrespectful to each other, I lived on a city that I can't even pronounce it's name because is the reason of all my misfortunes, people so damn vulgar, so damn low they can't even teach their kids how to be kind, how to be respectful to anyone. I learn about pride, that keep me away from bullying, they don't even know why they bullied me, bullies tend to attack people about their body, about if they are stupid, about a condition, they just attack me because it was me, and I know, they smell it like dogs, possessed maybe, because I didn't find a reasonable reason to understand what they bullied me, but in the middle of that, I thought why just can't we be friends? Why do we attack to each other? Only because I can't be vulgar like you? They is the reason why I hate my ethnicity, this stupid language called spanish talked only by freaking stupid people, because I learned about they, every single piece of word they say, why my country is infested with third-world-people, they are way too worried about lgbt and inclusiveness, why didn't they included me on society?

There was a guy, Alvaro C. was and still is his name, he was the most disgusting, profane, putrid and revolting person I ever met, he was just a compulsive masturbator, obsessed with pornography, I remember when he checked the teacher computer just for looking for sexual content, when he masturbates in class, I couldn't care less about his life except for one thing, he didn't let me breathe one miserable day when I was in school, he just looked for me to having some daily fun, let's make this piece of s**t even more s**t than he actual is he thought, I cried trying to understand why me? what did I got in myself that makes me so despreciable?, he didn't know about what thing inserted in my mind, now I'm him, now it's me who have a problem with porn addiction

When I was 14, I decided to play guitar, not only that, now I'm feeling that I'm able to put some music on the radio with some effort and money, but I don't have the energy left to do something, actually I just don't have energy to do nothing more than just laying in my bed and watching these repulsive videos that I hate, but I can't left behind for some reason, this thing is just consuming my brain, all my abilities, my smartness, my heart, my soul, I want to leave it but I'm thinking that I have no reason to do that, because for me now life is just pointless, is just about being stupid, thinking stupid, talking stupid, living stupid, don't try to be some special for this world because this world will take you and make you descend down to their level, descend down to hell, and if you make it to the top maybe it's because you are like they by default, I got ideas, still have some beautiful ideas, but I'm alone, waiting for someone to help me that will never come, suicide is just a boring option, I know if I just die no one will notice and I hate that, I will not take that option because I don't want to give them the pleasure of that, it's freaking hypocrite when these criminals of society cry to a fallen relative, cry is a emotion just for good people so you know now why they don't cry me but instead cry to themselves, you may not believe in God, but you can make sure the Devil is in one of us waiting just for destroy everyone else and every piece of you, disguised as everything you know, the more you think everything is normal, the more you are far away from comprehend that life, this world f***ing hates you, that's not a advice, that's what I understood in 22 years.",Diealrod,0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/fdtbme/i_dont_really_think_if_one_phrase_could_even/,even know start always thought one thing always torture brain everyone wa child child wa perfect excuse hide condition know talk people know prolong conversation know anything sociable hand wa really smart really qualify something special people stupid think self centered instead thinking personality maybe one thing even comprehend society well continue able whatever want something amazing felt feel got powerful superpower able think something interesting make real make like wa professional something even talk even express brain amazing idea taking trash something miserable much kid teen worried thing people say worry 100 sure shine correct people ask 22 22 year find anyone like anyone talk interesting thing superficial stupid thing anyone take life like poetry right value anyone understands anyone hated school partner always thought thing ruin day understand small tiny disrespectful lived city even pronounce name reason misfortune people damn vulgar damn low even teach kid kind respectful anyone learn pride keep away bullying even know bullied bully tend attack people body stupid condition attack wa know smell like dog possessed maybe find reasonable reason understand bullied middle thought friend attack vulgar like reason hate ethnicity stupid language called spanish talked freaking stupid people learned every single piece word say country infested third world people way worried lgbt inclusiveness included society wa guy alvaro c wa still name wa disgusting profane putrid revolting person ever met wa compulsive masturbator obsessed pornography remember checked teacher computer looking sexual content masturbates class care le life except one thing let breathe one miserable day wa school looked daily fun let make piece even actual thought cried trying understand got make despreciable know thing inserted mind problem porn addiction wa 14 decided play guitar feeling able put music radio effort money energy left something actually energy nothing laying bed watching repulsive video hate left behind reason thing consuming brain ability smartness heart soul want leave thinking reason life pointless stupid thinking stupid talking stupid living stupid try special world world take make descend level descend hell make top maybe like default got idea still beautiful idea alone waiting someone help never come suicide boring option know die one notice hate take option want give pleasure freaking hypocrite criminal society cry fallen relative cry emotion good people know cry instead cry may believe god make sure devil one u waiting destroy everyone else every piece disguised everything know think everything normal far away comprehend life world f ing hate advice understood 22 year,really think one phrase could even describe destroyed,die al rod

Save Me,"I... I can't imagine dying, it's not something that I want.

And yet these thoughts they still exist and seem to scare and creep and haunt.

Plenty of ways to go about it, some are easy, some are not.

I let the feelings fill me up till I become too deep in thought.





I'm standing on a bridge, I'm looking down at frigid water.

I have come here with a thought, and intentions of self-slaughter.

But when I stand up on the railing, I want someone to come,

Someone to shout and pull me down, stop me from doing something dumb.





I want a stranger's embrace, to reassure me it's okay.

To tell me that it isn't worth it, that the trip's only one-way

I want to bawl and breakdown, in the arms of the unknown.

So I can maybe feel cared about, and not feel so alone...





Now I'm in my room, with a note and rope in hand.

Thinking I'll finally fall through, let my thoughts and mind disband.

But when I step off of that stool, I want my mom to come rush down,

To pull me out my quiet guillotine, and stop my silent drown.





Oh, she'd probably hug and sob, knowing what I had tried to do.

Glad she ran down stairs to check on me, as if had been on cue.

That night would stay with her forever, make her always high alert,

To stop her child from disappearing, or end up permanently hurt.






However in both situations, I would simply end up dead.

That is, if I could follow through with all these thoughts that haunt my head.

Alas I am not suicidal, just a faking wannabee,

Cause I don't actually want to die, I just want someone to save me...",SexuallyConfusedEgg,10,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/fdr9h5/save_me/,imagine dying something want yet thought still exist seem scare creep haunt plenty way go easy let feeling fill till become deep thought standing bridge looking frigid water come thought intention self slaughter stand railing want someone come someone shout pull stop something dumb want stranger embrace reassure okay tell worth trip one way want bawl breakdown arm unknown maybe feel cared feel alone room note rope hand thinking finally fall let thought mind disband step stool want mom come rush pull quiet guillotine stop silent drown oh probably hug sob knowing tried glad ran stair check cue night would stay forever make always high alert stop child disappearing end permanently hurt however situation would simply end dead could follow thought haunt head ala suicidal faking wannabee cause actually want die want someone save,save,sexually confused egg

I guess this is me venting? Not sure what to call it.,"TL;DR: I'm feeling really down, have shut myself away, and don't know how to get through this anymore.

Hi, I'm Brendan. Im a 27(soon to be 28) y/o male, and I don't know what to do anymore. I've been trying to avoid posting because in the end I feel it doesn't matter anyway, but I have to say something.

This isn't a cry for help, I wouldn't accept any because I feel I should be able to get over my problems by myself.

I was diagnosed wish major depressive disorder at 15, then obsessive compulsive behavior at 23, with generalized anxiety coming in at 25. I know I cannot simply get over my issues because they're in my brain. I also know that it's all in my head, that's why they're called mental problems.

To get to the point, I'm lonely. I have like 3 friends, but I know if I had a girlfriend I would still be lonely. When I had one, who was amazing, I still was feeling alone. I really just think that it's all going so bad because I deserve it, and that it will make the good times seem better.

I'm not patient when it comes to my feelings. I want this feeling to go away more than anything. I've basically sheltered myself in my room for the past year and a half. I don't remember how to talk to people or act in public. I have a job, but only because I'm striving to not be homeless.

I'm sorry if anything I said upsets anyone somehow, I really needed to say something. I'm starting to lose the battle in my head again. I feel like I've been fighting it for much too long. I want to just give up fighting and give in to the sickness taking me over.

I can’t - Depression fatigue? Is there such a thing?,"Been married about 17 years, my wife has had varying levels of depression right throughout that, and I think I’ve got ‘depression fatigue’. 
I just made up that term, I’m sure theres probably a real medical term for it.
I just can’t deal with it anymore. It’s consumed every piece of happiness, smile, laughter and fun I’ve had in me. We’ve got 4 kids and it’s affecting them too.

I can’t deal with her complaining anymore
I can’t deal with her moods anymore
I can’t deal with her abuse anymore
I can’t deal with being used as her verbal and emotional punching bag
I can’t keep doing everything around the house
I can’t keep dreading every time my phone rings and it’s her, wondering what it will be about, will she be losing her shit on the other end of the phone,
I can’t keep coming home and wondering what sort of mood she’s in.
I can’t dread her waking up in the morning, knowing she’s in a shit mood 13 out of 14 days
I can’t walk in or out of the house, say hi/bye, give her a kiss to be told to fuck off, I hate you, you’re a piece of shit, a cunt, or that she wishes I get hit by a train, have a car accident or similar.
I can’t be told I don’t do anything around the house, or about all the things I ‘don’t do’.
I can’t be told that I’m a shit father, and about all the things I don’t do with them, even though I’m with them every night and weekend when she’s at work, I take them to school, make their lunches and dinner.
I can’t be told how crap my family is, and that my dad who dies 3 years ago was a lazy piece of shit.
I can’t fight with her every time my mum is in town and wants to see us and the kids, especially as she’s moving to the same town this week so she can see more of us.
I can’t be told how she doesn’t have any time for herself, yet she directly controls how she spends every minute of her day.
I can’t her her complain about the house anymore, no it’s not a display home, but it’s FAR from dirty!
I can’t hear her complain about the kids and how much they fight - where do you think they learnt that behaviour from?
I can’t hear about finances, when we spend SO much on takeaway food or fresh food that gets thrown out because it’s gone off uneaten.
I can’t hear her complain about her weight, you got the op done, lost heaps of weight and haven’t been to the gym to tone.
I can’t hear her complain about not going to the gym and having paid for the membership for the last 8 months, you’re in control of your days and how you spend it.
I can’t hear you say to me I’m different towards you today/tonight, did you forget how you told me today what a piece of shit I am, you wish you never met me and you’re going to go and find someone to give you attention.
I can’t be told how much I repulse you when we have sex, and that you have to think of someone else to orgasm.
I can’t be told that I’m just here to look after the kids and support you and them financially.

Thinking of running away,"I want to die. Im not scared of death, or of what will happen, i have no one, my death wouldnt hurt anyone. But i dont want to hurt.

Having to prepare myself to hang out with some friends.,"Going bowling with some friends from school this weekend, and I’m looking forward to it but also scared of ruining the night.


I wanna be myself, but at the same time, I don’t wanna come off as depressing to everyone, I have to put on a happy face, and act like everything is okay.

And it really sucks you know? I wish I could be vocal about my life and not be given blank looks from everyone and turn the mood sour with my negativity.

Psychic Deadness depression conflation?,"I, like I think many people here, like to sometimes exist in a fantasy world, where we are worshiped or heroes or even the creators, as a means of escaping.

 I, like I suspect many here are, am a massive anime and fantasy nerd, but also am very into science explaining stuff. 

The other night I types ESP / Psychic into Google Scholar and I stumbled upon a great book called Psychic Deadness- Michael Eigen, which so aptly describes a lot of the sentiment I can feel from this sub. 

If you are able to, give the first few pages a read and maybe this can help you articulate your own emotions better and find the source of a lot of the suffering",Zangoma,0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/fdpc78/psychic_deadness_depression_conflation/,like think many people like sometimes exist fantasy world worshiped hero even creator mean escaping like suspect many massive anime fantasy nerd also science explaining stuff night type esp psychic google scholar stumbled upon great book called psychic deadness michael eigen aptly describes lot sentiment feel sub able give first page read maybe help articulate emotion better find source lot suffering,psychic deadness depression conflation,zan go

Tomorrow is my thesis defense and I am not doing anything,"I tried making progress on my thesis from a few weeks back but it has been so difficult, not just in a mental state. Ever since I got depression, I have the hardest time focusing on stuff. Even if I tried to focus on doing stuff I enjoy doing, I can't do it for long, my head gets dizzy. I can't read lines in a book without getting my vision blurry and end up forgetting which line I was supposed to read.

And I also have the hardest time to recall short term and long term memories. These days I would have lunch and half an hour later I would ask myself ""wait, did I eat lunch today ? or was it yesterday ? Do I need to eat again ?"". I can't tell which day of the week is it. I currently don't have the two things that are absolutely crucial for my productivity, which is concentration and memory. I try to bring myself up but it is so freaking hard when my body can't respond back.

I guess now I just have to do what I can and try to brace myself for tomorrow, for I am sure to be destroyed during my defense tomorrow. I am scared sh\*tless because I know one of the professors can be ruthless and heartless, can only imagine how heartbreaking it will be tomorrow. I want to pat myself on the back and say ""Its okay, its gonna be fine. You've done your best against all odds. If you fail tomorrow its fine, you can try again next time"" but I can't bring myself to do that, and I am scared and I feel alone.

I'm drinking myself to death and it is causing my family pain,"The reason I drink is to self medicate because I saw my friend pass away in a car accident when I was 19. We were both stupid and I challenged him to a race using our parents cars. Basically, he understeered into a tree. I have tried therapy but it didn't work for me. I was also diagnosed with PTSD and depression. I stopped taking my prescription because it didn't work for me. I feel that I have blood on my hands because I was the one who made him do it. 

My parents and grandfather came to me and told me that they were worried about my drinking problem. I sometimes drink a bottle of Vodka a day. I just want to drink myself to death. My granddad tried to relate to the situation by telling me about the things he was in Vietnam. I walked out because I was upset about everything. I now think that I was out of order and I would do anything to apologise.

"I know this will get lost, but I'm just so tired of being alive.","Every day now for years, it's been exactly the same. Wake up, attend online school, get scolded by my teachers and parents for my poor grades and how slow I am, spend hours doing homework I struggle with, be overwhelmed and stressed about my life, cry, go to bed, and repeat. On the weekends I'll either just sit in my room all day watching YouTube or nap all day because I can't even find the energy to get out of bed and do anything. I can't even find the will to finish my overwhelming amounts of homework. I don't enjoy anything anymore. I don't have any skills, talents, or interests, and I can't even get a job since I live in the middle of nowhere and I'm terrified of learning to drive. I don't even really know anything about the real world. I'm just a husk of a person who rots in isolation in my room all day fantasizing about dying. I am so desperately alone and I feel like a absolute worthless moron. My entire life I've never even had one friend to talk or confide in. Every time in the past when I was going to public school and tried to make friends with people I always fucked up and made myself look idiotic because I never understood how to talk to people and form connections with them. I can't even make online friends. No one cares about me, not even my own parents. Every time I try to have a conversation with my mom, (who is the only thing keeping me from not being totally socially isolated as I am pathetically desperate just to have someone talk to me since I have no one else) she doesn't even bother to pretend to listen to me. She has more important things to do than spare a moment of her time talking to me. I get it, but I wish she didn't make it so obvious. 

I just am so tired of trying to survive each day of hell by myself. I don't see how life can get any better when I'm already incapable of achieving anything. It doesn't help either that I'm so scared about the future. I don't know what I want out of my life, and even if I did, I'd have no idea how to get there with how far I've fallen behind everyone else and how unmotivated I am. I'm scared of fucking my life up even more than I already have. Maybe it'd be easier at this point for me to just drown myself to prevent having a depressing future where I'm suffering even more. I don't really know.

It might not make sense to a lot of people but it really gave me perspective and made me feel a little better!,"I had a thought today while I was mulling over what a shitty mood I’ve been in lately. Basically I was thinking about how my latest depressive episode was lasting longer than usual, about how tired I was and all I wanted to do was take a long ass nap and just chill for a few days- I wanted to not have to deal with all the responsibilities on my plate right now, and thought about how great it would be if I could have someone “take my shift” for my life this week. 
And it just popped into my head that maybe that’s what happens when we get thrown back into depressive episodes- maybe someone has been feeling so shitty for such a long time that the universe has decided to give them a break and I’m the one that’s been chosen to “take the shift”, bearing some heavy emotions, etc. And that when I’m lucky enough to have some free time for an afternoon snooze or just to watch a movie, someone else is taking my “shift” for a while.

Anxiety has ruined me.,"Everything I've had in life has slowly been ruined by anxiety.  


Friends I used to talk with constantly are now either gone or distant because I just can't keep up with them anymore. I've separated from so much of my family because of my own choices and shitty habits. I'm unable to beat them. For years I've wanted to reconnect with the people I shut out, but I've become trapped in a self-destructive cycle where I'm too ashamed to admit my problems to the same people I just want to make proud.  


I've lost every job the same way. Whether it's throwing up in the bathrooms at work or failing to muster up the courage to even call in sick, it finds its place in the worst possible ways without fail.  
It's been like this for years. I live at home with no job, no car, not even highschool degree four years after I should have graduated. I don't even have a driver's licence.   
I've been hospitalized twice, both times in relation to this problem that just won't go away. Nothing works.  


Every day I'm met with opportunities but pass on every single one of them. I'm young, I'm healthy, and I know I'm still capable. I have so many choices and yet it feels like there are none anymore.",Fish129,2,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/fdk8gy/anxiety_has_ruined_me/,everything life ha slowly ruined anxiety friend used talk constantly either gone distant keep anymore separated much family choice shitty habit unable beat year wanted reconnect people shut become trapped self destructive cycle ashamed admit problem people want make proud lost every job way whether throwing bathroom work failing muster courage even call sick find place worst possible way without fail like year live home job car even highschool degree four year graduated even driver licence hospitalized twice time relation problem go away nothing work every day met opportunity pas every single one young healthy know still capable many choice yet feel like none anymore,anxiety ha ruined,fish 129

Emotional hurricane,"So this is my first reddit post, so bear with me. I am not suicidal, so I don't want anyone to think I am in dire need of assistance. I don't want to scare anyone. But I do have depression, for 2-3 years now. I wrote a journal entry today that kind of illustrates how i constantly feel. 24/7. I've been journaling on and off for maybe 6 years, but tonight, after 7 months of not writing, I just felt this urgent need to put my feelings to pen and paper. Reading it back, its kind of scary (knowing myself) how dark it is, if that makes sense?  I don't really know why I'm posting it. Maybe someone out there will say 'SAME BITCH I FEEL THE SAME FUCKIN WAYYYYY'??? Who knows. Anyways, here goes:

&amp;#x200B;

What does it mean when you feel so sad/lost/hopeless, but none of your friends or family seem to notice? To be constantly around people, but to feel so alone? To feel like you're being sucked into this black hole, but no one is around to help you out? To not really know how you feel? To wishing you were brave enough to tell other how you're feeling? To reach out for help? But at the same time, feeling hurt because nobody seems to care? To want someone to look into your eyes and see the sadness and tell you it's going to be okay? For the ones 'closest' to you to hear the lie in your laugh? To feel alone? Abandoned? Like you'll never be happy again? To be so scared that you'll feel this sad and lonely forever? Sometimes I really wonder if there is a single person out there that cares about my feelings, about my health, about my state of mind. I try so hard to be shoulder to cry on for my loved ones, to be a support system. But what about me? I've spent my whole life putting other people's needs before my own, and now that I'm trying SO HARD to focus on myself and put my needs first, I'm alone. Even the few people I've shared my feelings with are nowhere to be seen. What's the point in sharing if nobody cares? Because nobody cares, right? I think it's pretty obvious at this point. So what do you do when you have no support system?  No one in your corner to encourage you? To fight for you? To fight FOR you? When there's no one to tell you 'it's going to be okay'? To give you a hug while you cry? Because you're always crying. I don't know. I just want my smile to be real again.",04sabdi,6,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/fdpjop/emotional_hurricane/,first reddit post bear suicidal want anyone think dire need assistance want scare anyone depression 2 3 year wrote journal entry today kind illustrates constantly feel 24 7 journaling maybe 6 year tonight 7 month writing felt urgent need put feeling pen paper reading back kind scary knowing dark make sense really know posting maybe someone say bitch feel fuckin wayyyyy know anyways go march 4th 2020 amp x200b doe mean feel sad lost hopeless none friend family seem notice constantly around people feel alone feel like sucked black hole one around help really know feel wishing brave enough tell feeling reach help time feeling hurt nobody seems care want someone look eye see sadness tell going okay one closest hear lie laugh feel alone abandoned like never happy scared feel sad lonely forever sometimes really wonder single person care feeling health state mind try hard shoulder cry loved one support system spent whole life putting people need trying hard focus put need first alone even people shared feeling nowhere seen point sharing nobody care nobody care right think pretty obvious point support system one corner encourage fight fight one tell going okay give hug cry always cry know want smile real,emotional hurricane,04 abdi

I left a domestic violent relationship and they’re days that haunt me of what happened and it shuts me down even more. I sit alone in my car at lunch because no one wants to be around me.

I'm failing school and I cant explain to the teachers why I'm doing bad because they won't care,"I'm getting really bad grades in a class I used to be really good at. And in another class I'm being really disorganized losing sheets and not getting homework done on time. Truth is, Im exhausted from the moment I wake up so I'll just sleep when i get home, or I'll need to distract myself with a low effort activity rather than concentrate on homework to calm myself down from wanting to hurt myself. But I'm just lazy right? It's so frustrating being seen as careless when I'm just trying to survive. But my teachers expect me to get over myself because everyone goes through hard times. I'm already seeing a school counsellor who's not helping in any way and it's in secret because my parents wont let me see a proper therapist. Yesterday when I got 2 essays back I got E on both of them and I just wanted to tear my hair out because I'm trying so hard to balance everything out but it's not good enough. Seriously, all I can think about is killing myself and it's good enough that I actually come into school when I dont want anyone to see me because I feel too ugly, and I try to socialise with people and not zone out in class for like 8 hours. I just want everyone to know I have depression and help me out in any way but no. They dont give a shit.

Venting.,"Hi. I have had a bit of a rough day and honestly it feels like my thoughts are actually killing me. So I really feel like I need to express my feelings right now.
So my thoughts are just gonna be thrown out there so without further ado....
I think I suck. At everything...my job, having friends, just...everything really. It honestly feels like I cannot just work like a human being.

Now don't get me wrong, i don't hate life. I have things I rather love about life such as my family and my job including the people I work with.

And everyone keeps telling me how ""nice"" and ""good"" I am at my job such as winning a rather ""employee of the month"" sorta thing but as strange as this seems....

I struggle to believe them. Now of course I'm not calling them liars I just find it to hard to believe. I know that sounds rather stupid but I honestly just can't help feel this way.

As I said I truly love my job and everyone there but that is honestly where most of my self esteem comes from so constantly thinking I'm horrible at it is obviously not a good cycle.

Now as for everything else apart from my job, well I will just break it down like this:
I'm at overweight, ugly, shy, embarssing and awkward guy that honestly anyone could cringe at talking to. And of course I'm trying to overcome some of these things like the overweight part but...I'm honestly losing hope at this point and it's giving thoughts of doing something silly to my self.

Sorry about this silly dump of self pity but I actually couldn't think of what else to do.

26 and feeling so burnt out,"Long story short.. I've been in and out of college, failing out two different times taking breaks from classes once or twice. I've had on and off addiction problems with alcohol during this time.. basically I've been trying to get a bachelor's degree for 7 years. The last 4 years of college has caused me soo much stress. My parents are wealthy and not to say they are at fault in any way for my failire but they have sort of enabled me financially  to keep trying to get a degree. Ive wasted probly around $100,000 dollars on failed/withdrawn classes. My sister deeply resents me for this. I have an insane amount of guilt for this too even though my parents say they would pay anything and help me in any way they can for me to graduate. 

So after all that, i made it to my final semester b4 graduation. Im only taking 2 classes but i might fail 1 of them and that would result in my 3rd and final academic dismissal, meaning i wount get a degree cause of a flunk in my final semester. I just dont understand why i cant just sit here and do my homework and actually care. My problem is i dont give a crap about anything unless i have an innate desire or interest in it. Like my motivation is just 0 in anything thats academic i dont understand why!

So after all this.. even if i do pass and graduate i feel like im so broken, endured so much stress by the age of 26 that i feel like just a vegetable now.  i cant fathom myself using my business degree to get a ""real job""  i dont know if ill ever be able to get over the idea that i spent over 250,000 dollars on a degree and i have no desiree to work a normal job because i feel like my brain is this empty void that only seeks pleasure and has no purpose or drive. On the surface, im a happy bubbly person. Im outgoing and very sociable. I feel deep down i really have alot of potential but im soooo lost and so easily overwhelmed by everything. I feel the slightest bit of resistance and i just shut down mentally and seek pleasure in the form of leisure activity or alcohol. 

Idk where im even going with this.. sorta just letting it all out i guess because i have nobody to talk too. If you read this far im sorry for all the grammatical errors i just typed it all out and didnt re read it once.

Trapped,"Over the last few years, I've gone through various cycles of depression, anxiety &amp; panic attacks. I've fallen into the trap of everything's fine again i'm alright, only to be hit by a oncoming train of depression 6 months later. I spend a lot of time in my room alone &amp; I rarely leave the house much and when I do leave I feel massively anxious &amp; I feel much worse when dealing with people. I get hit sporadicly with depression &amp; insomnia, which makes everything so much worse. Insomnia has a truely wonderful talent of nuking everything.

I feel like I have no future and certainly no future or a life where i'm happy or even content. I've spoken to friends and loved ones about jobs and I always get the wishy-washy response of ""you'll be fine"" or ""everything will work out fine"". I want to have purpose in life but I just feel so incredibly hollow &amp; low all the time &amp; all my interests and hobbies just fade away. I'm absolutely terrified of applying for jobs (i've had a few interviews that completely nuked my mental health for more than a year) in fear that it's going to destroy my mental health again (had very bad experiences in my last job) and it doesn't help when friends/family tell me I need to apply or jobs or that i'm lazy. I really don't know what it is i'm suppose to do? or what it is that people think I should be doing? 

My biggest concern is that I just feel like if this is something I have to cope with for the rest of my life, I just don't think I'm going to be able to cope and I really worry where that will lead and what bearing it'll have on the important decisions in life. I'm really struggling to help myself and get help. Even writing this post has been hard (this is my fifth attempt) &amp; composing my thoughts has been really difficult. 

Has anyone had similar problems? or been in a similar situation and overcome it? I really don't want this but I feel like i'm stuck with it unable to do anything about it.

When I'm alone is when I'm most at risk.,"When I'm at work, I talk, laugh, and hide behind my shield. When I'm with family, I'm a little more vulnerable, but I'm mostly still silent about the things that are working hard against me to bring me down. However, when I'm alone...that's when it hits me. When my kids aren't home and I'm left to my own devices, that's when I'm the most afraid. It's not that I don't think anyone would miss me, it's the fact that I don't honestly care if they would or wouldn't. I feel like if they knew the extreme pain and mental anguish I'm in from the events my life has drug me through, they would understand my want for release. The constant cheating of exes, the constant deception and pain from being tossed away over and over again. The uselessness I feel of getting out of bed because the same vicious cycle awaits me every single day of my life! I'm tired. I'm tired of giving myself to others, putting myself out there and making myself vulnerable, just to wash, rinse, and repeat a thousand times more. Is it time for me to go? Does it matter?

Furiously Tired of “Running at it like a Bull”,"People are unrelatable and hindering to me at this point. I feel as if every time someone approaches me, or walks into my space, I can predict what they are going to say to me. This annoys me further.

Ive been fired from the last 5 jobs, all for reasons of using marijuana to calm myself from my co workers, or outright having a verbal confrontation which results in me getting fired. I used to like being around people, but as i reach the age of 25 i feel like i’ve been struggling for an eternity.

Im truly tired of this fucking 9-5 society everyone seems to be able to spend 40 years in and come out accomplished. It seems no matter how many counsellors  i appoint myself with, or how many doctors appointments im making nobody is helping me and i feel im reaching my breaking point. I know i cant live without society, but this cant continue.

Ive tried steps to help myself, counselling, therapy, doctors appointments; all leads back to the same bullshit place im in now, stuck in society. 

Ive recently acquired my second dui, have a breathalyzer in my vehicle and spend most days sitting at home thinking about how much i hate interacting with people.

The women my age ive dated and been around dont want to hear any of this. Men arent supposed to complain or whine. Im supposed to shut up, apply for another job, and continue to “run at it like a bull”.

"Ex bf is suicidal, depressed, and mentally ""not there"".. how to help?","I broke up with my bf about a year and a half ago, after being together 4 years. Throughout our relationship he was often depressed, angry at everything, narcissistic, extremely anxious, would go through phases of not eating, etc. I tried helping as much as I could and encouraging he get help (which he did a few times, on and off seeing a therapist) but it never worked.

I had to cut off our relationship because it just became ""too much"". He would blame me for his carelessness, would get annoyed if I offered help in any way, and was just constantly negative. I just often didn't feel loved, and without ranting his mental health issues were stressful as I tried and tried to help him and it felt useless.

When we broke up I didn't feel the need to block him but did not want to be ""friends"" or really ever have any communication any more. Since we broke up, he has texted me here and there that he's suicidal, hates everyone, screams at himself, has no reason to live, etc. He told me that since I broke up with him he would kill himself, but i took that more so as manipulation. I would text him trying to help, offering advice, and so on, which was mentally draining because any time I'd try and help he'd continue texting things like ""I'm just gonna kill myself"". I have told him so many times he needs professional help and by doing so will improve his mental health. 

He's nearly 30 and has barely held a job because he ""hates all the managers"" wherever he works and continuously drops out of school to sit at home and be handed money by his mom and play PS4 all day. When I encourage finding a different job or so on he gets offended and tells me I'm a ""slave"" because I have a full time job.

I've since entered a new relationship with someone I love very much. When my ex randomly occasionally texts me (he texts me probably once every 10-15 days) saying he wants to kill himself I panic and reply and try to help. I told my current bf about helping my ex and he was understandably upset. I know I need to stop communication with my ex but I worry by telling him we need to stop talking he actually will kill himself. I have told a close friend this and they told me if he doesn't want to accept help or seek any help, and kills himself, at least I tried and there was nothing more I could do. 

The other day at work I checked my phone and had a ton of missed texts from him saying he was going to kill himself  &amp; that he has no reason to live anymore. All the texts made me panic terribly, I had to leave work because I started crying and ended up calling suicide prevention (they were beyond unhelpful) because I know he needs help. After 4 years of hearing him talk about being depressed, and never accepting help and then breaking up and still hearing it through text and STILL trying to get him to see a professional and get help I am honestly burned out and mentally drained. I don't know what else I can do at this point besides telling him, for the last time, he needs help and due to me being in a new relationship we need to stop talking and I wish him the best.",videostore01,4,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/fdn8t6/ex_bf_is_suicidal_depressed_and_mentally_not/,broke bf year half ago together 4 year throughout relationship wa often depressed angry everything narcissistic extremely anxious would go phase eating etc tried helping much could encouraging get help time seeing therapist never worked cut relationship became much would blame carelessness would get annoyed offered help way wa constantly negative often feel loved without ranting mental health issue stressful tried tried help felt useless broke feel need block want friend really ever communication since broke ha texted suicidal hate everyone scream ha reason live etc told since broke would kill took manipulation would text trying help offering advice wa mentally draining time try help continue texting thing like gonna kill told many time need professional help improve mental health nearly 30 ha barely held job hate manager wherever work continuously drop school sit home handed money mom play ps4 day encourage finding different job get offended tell slave full time job since entered new relationship someone love much ex randomly occasionally text text probably every 10 15 day saying want kill panic reply try help told current bf helping ex wa understandably upset know need stop communication ex worry telling need stop talking actually kill told close friend told want accept help seek help kill least tried wa nothing could day work checked phone ton missed text saying wa going kill amp ha reason live anymore text made panic terribly leave work started cry ended calling suicide prevention beyond unhelpful know need help 4 year hearing talk depressed never accepting help breaking still hearing text still trying get see professional get help honestly burned mentally drained know else point besides telling last time need help due new relationship need stop talking wish best,ex bf suicidal depressed mentally help,video store 01

Am i depressed?,"*Posting on behalf of friend*

Basically I'm perpetually sad, but for no apparent reason (I work a lot at 17, but that seems normal)

I think suicide is a valid option, as I would be at peace, but I do not want to commit suicide due to friends and family feeling bad.

I also feel lonely, even around friends and family which leads to me think this is depression.

Is this depression, or is this just a phase?

I've ruined my whole damn life before it's even started,"Pretty sure this will get buried in all the other posts but I guess I need somewhere to vent... either that or i just want to remind myself what a piece of shit i am. 

I've been depressed pretty much my entire life, i never realised it, i thought everyone was sad all the time and had a constant pit in their stomach like they wanted to cry and had random thoughts about killing themselves. 
I've been going through this shit since elementary school. 
I've always been the akward kid that was overly loud and made jokes at my own expense in order to get others to crack a smile. 
I've never been good at keeping friendships let alone making friendships. Ive always considered myself a loner in a way, mainly because I always feel like I want to be alone. 

I've never been to a party unless it was for a birthday, never gone drinking with friends, never really had a conversation with anyone without it turning into an akward silence after a while. 
I'm currently a senior in highschool and I feel like I've wasted my highschool years. 

My freshman year I met this girl, she was great, caring, shy, cute, and seemed to truly listen to what i said. 
I never had the balls to ask her out which I suppose was a good thing because later on I found out that she was gay. 

After half a year, she got more and more involved with the highschool lgbt community which was full of just flat out rude people. 
This changed her... for the worse. She started spending alot less time with me, and before I knew it we had gone an entire month without spending any time together. I'd always ask her if she wanted to hang out but she was always ""busy"". 

She slowly started to do a complete 180 from who she used to be. She was becoming very self centered and was always saying how nice of a person she is. 
I eventually stopped talking to her completely because I realised she was destroying me. I was in love with who she used to be and I guess I thought that the harder I tried to be her friend, maybe shed start to like being around me again, i guess i was wrong. 
At one point i stopped even acknowledging her like she did to me and i guess this annoyed her because she would text me and ask me why i was doing it. 
I'd send a lengthy text explaining why and it's like she didnt even read it because she kept doing the exact same things that i told her were making me feel like trash below her. 

This friendship absolutely destroyed me and i became extremely depressed. I became somewhat of a hermit that would go to school and as soon as I got home would sleep until the next day. 
I still am really sad about what happened and I cant help but blame myself for not doing something or saying something earlier about how her friends were making her treat others. 

Well, basically, this kind of destroyed me self esteem and any confidence I had left. I was now the quiet kid at school, although my friend says that i dont really seem like the quiet type, I'm 6 foot 2 inches tall and am built like a ""viking"" as he says. 
I havent spent time with him in months because I can barely bring myself to leave my house. 
He is pretty much my last friend and i feel like I'm letting him slip away like i have with all my other friends and its destroying me but I'm too afraid to do anything about it. I hate myself, I'm a terrible friend and I dont know how to change it. 

I've always been known as the ""nice guy"" who helps in any way I can and likes to talk to anyone who is willing to give me the time of day. Now.... well I dont even know. 
There was a lady at the store the other day who dropped something, she had a cane and her arms full and I just fucking watched her struggle to pick her stuff up off the ground. What kind of fucking person just watches someone struggle??? Apparently I do... I just like, froze I guess, I couldn't move my body, it was like I was paralyzed and I had a pit in my stomach and I felt just really anxious if that's how youd describe it. 
I hate who I've become, I just want to go back to being the kind guy who always helps others instead of watching them struggle like a jackass. 

I dont know how to fix who I have become and I'm afraid it's going to affect me when I try and get a job this summer and when I go to college, I'm afraid I'm going to be this shell of who i used to be, someone who just watches things happen instead of giving a helping hand. I feel like agoddamn failure, mainly because I am. 

I guess this story type thing doesnt really have any point, just me talking to myself reflecting on how much of an asshole I am. If someone actually reads this, well, then I'd love any suggestions on how i can get rid of this damn shell. 

I left alot of details out, but it's 1am and I have school in the morning so maybe I'll come back sometime on my computer and fill in a bit more.

Why can't I be happy for friends who are doing well for themselves,"Whenever I run into a friend I always try and be supportive and happy for them if they are doing well.

Diary Entry 01 - I hate Xi Jin Ping,"Dear Diary,

I feel myself, yet again, sliding into the abyss of darkness.

Is it better that I remain fueled by anger and frustration at the CCP? When hopelessness overtakes anger, I feel sucked into a swirling vortex of desolation.

Knives, scissors, any shiny sharp object - they all beckon warmly, seducing me with sweet promises of an end to this pain.

Carefully laid plans, budgets, all gone awry because of a situation beyond control. Exacerbated by one man's greed for power and face.

I fear to run out of anger. When fury no longer triggers, and desolation lays waste to sanity, it would probably be the beginning of the end.

Love,

I go to the gym 4 days a week, I eat healthy, I try to do some chores and self care too. I don’t know if I need meds because apparently I show signs of willingness so I don’t need them.

Another long frustrated rant,"So I've been seeing a therapist for a couple of months now, and besides all the other upsides of therapy, I think my favorite and also most frustrating part is that my therapist confirmed that I am incredibly self-aware. 

To the point that she usually just agrees with me and I spend a lot of my sessions just talking to myself. Because I already know why my thoughts are irrational. I know I shouldn't let these things bother me. I know I'm not alone. I know this is an ongoing thing, I know, I know I know. 

And that's so frustrating. Because knowing doesnt make me feel any better. Knowing I need to learn how to like myself better and be okay to be alone  doesnt help me actually get there. And when I get there, or think I've gotten there, I dont really feel any better. 

Yes, I'm lonely. I should learn to enjoy my own company and spend time with people who actually want to be with me. Great! Done that! Do this all the fucking time. But I feel the same. I'm still lonely. I still hate myself. 

Worst part is that I cant even blame anyone or anything. I did this. I'm doing this. I'm the problem. 

My therapist part of the problem is that I overthink and keep having these expectations for myself. That I should try to just ""do"" what feels right. But I already do that. If anything, I do it too much. That's why I'm starting to accumulate so much junk in my house.

I genuinely feel good after being depressed for over one year straight,"Hey! The past year I've been really depressed. I tried to kill myself and felt like it wasn't getting better at all. I somehow managed to deal with everyday life, but I didn't really live. I knew what kind of behavior was appropriate and I tried acting accordingly, but I didn't feel what I was doing. The destination of my thoughts was always suicide. I thought about it a lot. I planned multiple suicide attempts. I wrote  farewell letters. Stuff like that. 
Now I slowly return to my true self. It's like I'm able to see the world in colour again. It's not that I'm always happy. There are days I feel bad. Even days I'm depressed again. But it's way better than it used to be. I'm in touch with my feelings again. I've almost forgotten how sensitive I was. I feel alive again and that's fucking amazing!

The reason I post this here is that I wanna remind you (and maybe even myself) that it gets better. You got this. You're strong. I believe in you. No matter how bad you feel at the moment, remember there will be times you feel better and that are worth living for!

Help me name a feeling,"First of all, some details about me. I am 25 years old male in my last semester of college (yaaay!) and I call myself protypal geek - introverted IT guy who loves fantasy and Sci-fi. I am from a small European country. 

I am struggling with a feeling I can't quite name. Most of the time I feel incomplete, like some vital piece of me is missing. This feeling goes away and the world turns brighter the minute I start feeling attracted to someone. Just the possibility of having a girlfriend makes me happy, that feeling of hope. And the minute I lose that hope.. well.. hello darkness my old friend.

I've read the usual advice ""you need to be complete by yourself, find a new hobby or something that makes you happy"". I've tried, really tried. It's possible to silence it, but not remove it. When I focus on work, or on a game, a book, anything I need to put my mind on, it goes away. Unless I have a really bad day, then I need to drill through it if I want to get something done.

It kinda sounds like depression triggered by loneliness, is something like that even possible? It also have pretty firm grasp on my life, on my actions to be precise. I am driven to look for at least that hope. I am currently trying to expand my social circle. I found out that there is a pretty big fantasy/LARP community in our country. Problem is that I am going in with finding a girlfriend as my main goal. Yeah I will probably have lots of fun, but that's secondary. Rationally it sounds pretty bonkers.

One last thing I should probably mention is that I had girlfriends in the past, but with big pauses between them. The shortest pause was half a year but a standard pause is around two years which is also for how long I am alone now. One of my theories is that all this is happening because I am operating in scarcity mindset.

I hate it, I feel like I’m not even human anymore. I feel more like a robot. Everybody says they’ve seen such a difference in me since I started taking them, but I’m not feeling better. I’m not feeling anything. Which is scarier than feeling depressed, because it was the emptiness that drove me to start self harming years ago and I desperately do not want to go back to that place.

Im struggling with depression and anxiety and ADHD symptoms, but the therapist that was supposed to refer me to a doctor to see about medicine hasnt done that yet. Its been almost two weeks and he hasnt returned calls or taken any steps at all to get me that medicine evaluation. I am not enough for my girlfriend. Not romantic enough. Not sexual enough. Not thoughtful enough. I have tried for years to change that, she's been through all of it, but i haven't changed a bit. Maybe the medication would help, but i cant seem to be able to get it.
I struggle to learn in class, i struggle to improve in my relationship, and every day i find it more enticing to just fall back on my bachelors degree that i already have and work in an office or something. Sure, i know i wont be happy. But im not happy now, so whats the difference? At least i wouldnt have to put any more effort in than i have to.

Low,"My head feels crazy like super foggy and slowed down but also spinning at 100mph because im thinking about so much and stressed but also feel nothing and low and its very confusing so im trying to list 
Why am i feeling low starting from immediate problems to longer lasting /more distant problems:


-struggling to write essay

-4 separate deadlines looming, haven't even started reading for 3 of them

-everyone is better than me

-i do not feel like i deserve to be at the uni i am at because i do not feel clever enough or that i fit in and feel like no one cares about me

-my classmate/friend is 700x better than me at everything... She is genuinely good at everything and she loves to ""unknowingly"" rub it in my face and make dehumanising comments if i ever even allude to struggling with anything by the slightest amount... Like if i ever even start to ask her for help or talk about how i dont understand a lecture before i even get a sentence out she cuts me off with ""what? Noooooooo dont be so sILLY, thats obvious!"" or goes on about how easy she finds it or how ""i dont need to go to revision because i know everything and [talking about exam we did earlier in the term which she hasn't looked at her grades for yet] i would know if i got anything wrong and i know i didnt because i know what i was doing"" blah blah blah ok I get it u know everything and are god sent

-If i even suggest i might not be all that ok upstairs she tells me im fine and that i dont need to worry and literally just shuts me down and then  immediately complains when i dont talk to her when we walk to lectures together

-my friend is fucking the most self absorbed person you know and she doesnt even realise and to make it worse we are from polar opposite social classes (i.e she is rich, privately educated, lived extremely sheltered and ungrateful life where ahe gets whatever she wants whenever) so she always makes comments about things like if i mention student debt she LITERALLY went ""well your parents pay for university so dont worry""... And i had to go ""no they cannot afford to do that"" and then proceed to tell her, yes, i have had a job since i was 14 and no it wasnt because i wanted experience it was so i could afford the luxury of university and then explain what a bursary was and she kept making ignorant remarks like ""wha- why would you need that"" ""it doesn't cost thAT much"" and just... She is quite dehumanising and makes me feel like utter worthless shit. Its annoying because she doesnt realise how lucky she is and how lucky she is to of had to many opportunities handed to her and all the connections she has to good companies and high paying jobs just because of who her parents are... Like... All im saying is i wish she would stop being so blind to the world and actually learn that there are other people that exist that haven't lived the same life as her and i wish she would be respectful to people and not so fucking oblivious to the world!

-i miss home

-i am burnt out and need a break but i do not and will not ever get one because as soon as term is over, i need to revise. Then term starts and i learn. Then term ends and i revise and study and work and revise. No break ever.

-anxiety through the roof about everything

-i miss home

-other stuff like memories about things i forgot ever happened but i cant remember all the details or i remember everything over and over again and im not sure why they make me feel so horrible or nervous because theyre not necessarily bad events im just thinking about memories or events from when I was younger or not even from that long ago but i wish i wouldnt remember anything because it seems to be bothering me

-comparing myself to my sister, my sister being better than me, im expected to do really really well at uni ""for your sister"" (according to my mother since my sister is taking a year out of uni)... So MY degree isnt about me anymore its about doing it for my fucking sister who has basically stolen everything from me and now since she i taking a year out all the attention is on her, which is fine but now eveyone assumes she is the only one allowed to suffer and i am doing fantastic because i haven't dropped out or taken a year out or anything so apparently that means im fucking fantastic and going to get a 1st in my exams (""for"" my sister... Because i dont matter)... And i also cant go to my parents, not that i ever would have before, because all attention is on my sister and i am not allowed to let them down i have to do well for my sister

-genral annoyed about everything

-nothing is fair but im not allowed to say that because ""LiFeS nOt fAiR"" so i just have ro suck it up and pretend that im fantastic and love that everything is against me",azacitidine,8,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/fdly3a/low/,head feel crazy like super foggy slowed also spinning 100mph im thinking much stressed also feel nothing low confusing im trying list feeling low starting immediate problem longer lasting distant problem struggling write essay 4 separate deadline looming even started reading 3 everyone better feel like deserve uni feel clever enough fit feel like one care classmate friend 700x better everything genuinely good everything love unknowingly rub face make dehumanising comment ever even allude struggling anything slightest amount like ever even start ask help talk dont understand lecture even get sentence cut noooooooo dont silly thats obvious go easy find dont need go revision know everything talking exam earlier term looked grade yet would know got anything wrong know didnt know wa blah blah blah ok get u know everything god sent even suggest might ok upstairs tell im fine dont need worry literally shuts immediately complains dont talk walk lecture together friend fucking self absorbed person know doesnt even realise make worse polar opposite social class e rich privately educated lived extremely sheltered ungrateful life ahe get whatever want whenever always make comment thing like mention student debt literally went well parent pay university dont worry go cannot afford proceed tell yes job since wa 14 wasnt wanted experience wa could afford luxury university explain bursary wa kept making ignorant remark like wha would need cost much quite dehumanising make feel like utter worthless shit annoying doesnt realise lucky lucky many opportunity handed connection ha good company high paying job parent like im saying wish would stop blind world actually learn people exist lived life wish would respectful people fucking oblivious world miss home burnt need break ever get one soon term need revise term start learn term end revise study work revise break ever anxiety roof everything miss home stuff like memory thing forgot ever happened cant remember detail remember everything im sure make feel horrible nervous theyre necessarily bad event im thinking memory event wa younger even long ago wish wouldnt remember anything seems bothering comparing sister sister better im expected really really well uni sister according mother since sister taking year uni degree isnt anymore fucking sister ha basically stolen everything since taking year attention fine eveyone assumes one allowed suffer fantastic dropped taken year anything apparently mean im fucking fantastic going get 1st exam sister dont matter also cant go parent ever would attention sister allowed let well sister genral annoyed everything nothing fair im allowed say life fair ro suck pretend im fantastic love everything,low,aza citi dine

Physically and mentally broken,"Welp, just got done with another batch of doctors visits and the results are in, I will be crippled for the rest of my life.

But that's not what bothers me, I've had plenty of time to come to terms with my condition and the affect it will have on my quality of life and my life expectancy.

I'm so tired of all the bitterness...,"I had a bad childhood growing up. My parents were addicts and all they cared about was their addiction, so I grew up pretty much being raised and cared for by my brother and my grandmother. I've suffered through child abuse, sexual assault, and a hefty handful of mental illness throughout my life, and I'm just so tired of negativity. I struggled throughout my childhood with the hope that things would be better when I became an adult and got away from that lifestyle, but it's not. It feels like the whole damn world is just as hateful and cruel and nasty as my childhood was. How do you wake up in the morning and continue to go on when you haven't a hope in the world things are ever going to ""get better""? How do you wake up and brave the bullsh** of life when everywhere you look you see nothing but hate? Whenever I try to talk about it, I'm greeted with ""that's life"" or ""welcome to adulthood"" and I'm tired of it already. I'm tired of ""tough love"". I just can't wrap my mind around how so many people can be so hateful towards each other. People killing each other left and right, hating each other for the color of their skin, for the way they dress, the people they love, and the higher powers they choose to believe in. I just don't understand it all. My heart aches. I feel like a sad, lonely little girl who started running through a dark tunnel towards the light only to be greeted with a punch to the gut and a spit in the face when coming out the other end. I'll wake up every morning and live my life still, I'll go to work and do my job, make my money and pay my bills, but the light died in me a long time ago. I just hope the embers still burn and I'll find my spark again someday, but until then, existing will have to do.",MorbidMortician31,0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/fdlu6p/im_so_tired_of_all_the_bitterness/,bad childhood growing parent addict cared wa addiction grew pretty much raised cared brother grandmother suffered child abuse sexual assault hefty handful mental illness throughout life tired negativity struggled throughout childhood hope thing would better became adult got away lifestyle feel like whole damn world hateful cruel nasty childhood wa wake morning continue go hope world thing ever going get better wake brave bullsh life everywhere look see nothing hate whenever try talk greeted life welcome adulthood tired already tired tough love wrap mind around many people hateful towards people killing left right hating color skin way dress people love higher power choose believe understand heart ache feel like sad lonely little girl started running dark tunnel towards light greeted punch gut spit face coming end wake every morning live life still go work job make money pay bill light died long time ago hope ember still burn find spark someday existing,tired bitterness,morbid mortician 31

I Still Struggle Admitting I Need Help,"This is kinda a vent; I need to look myself in the mirror for a few minutes and try to restart my downward cycle. If you want to have a conversation, I’m here for it, otherwise nothing to see here haha.

I’ve been so low the past couple weeks I haven’t felt like myself at all. I’ve felt a fair amount of that apathy I read about on this sub often, and it’s scary.

I know the things I need to do in order to overcome this depression - the tools I can reach for. Exercise, nutrition, therapy, group therapy, being open with friends and family, volunteering, strong social connections, medical health, and on and on. The laundry list is long and tough to grapple with all at once. But having a couple of weeks of pure hell makes me realize that I’m really not working on any one of those things strongly. 

What have I done to really move forward in the last year? I feel like I haven’t really reached for any of those huge steps since I started therapy in 2015. I’ve been going for over four years, and it’s been life-changing, but what other healthy steps have I taken? 

Last summer my dental health became overwhelming, something I must take care of. I went back for my first appointment in years. Gradually I took care of my pain and the rot in my mouth was alleviated. I lost a tooth in the process but a huge weight was lifted as well. 

I need some similar weight lifted now, but most of all I want to be able to reach for it. I crave some discipline; the dental work came as a result of time running out as it were, reactive not proactive. I want to be strong enough to work thru this shit at a healthy pace, not leave things go awry for months on end, until a consequence happens. But I suppose in order to get there I have to first admit that I AM weak and I DO need help. I can’t do it all on my own like I tell myself I must. 

I’d really like to get an exercise bike. I can see all the positives: cardio health/body positivity/motivation to hike more/overall getting in shape. For someone healthy, buying a bike (putting in the research, going to stores, asking people for advice) would be doable. Simple tasks like that are fucking hard for me because I’m not healthy.

So how do I get there? Ask my sister to take me shopping one day? This post is a good start: question why I’ve failed in the past and talk through the doable steps, remind myself of the positive outcomes in working thru it. Maybe I need to meditate again: breathe thru the pressure in my chest when I think about going to a bike store or talking to people on Craigslist. 

I wish I could work thru these things easily like a normal person. I guess my win today is admitting I’m broken and depression is at fault. Maybe if I admit that more often I’ll see it’s ok to ask for help and beat myself up less.

I’ve never really lost love for myself because I know I’m a good man. My therapist told me that purpose can be looked at as two halves: BEing and DOing. Right now I’m happy with my self-philosophy and who I am when I’m NOT depressed. That person is good. It’s time to accept that I’m not healthy enough to DO good yet. At least not to the degree that I hope my future holds. It’s hard to reconcile how much depression is holding me back. I hope I can look myself in the mirror this deeply in the next little while and reach for more of that help that I need to pick myself up off the ground. Maybe it can start with the exercise bike.",OutsideitCZ,0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/fdk76f/i_still_struggle_admitting_i_need_help/,kinda vent need look mirror minute try restart downward cycle want conversation otherwise nothing see haha low past couple week felt like felt fair amount apathy read sub often scary know thing need order overcome depression tool reach exercise nutrition therapy group therapy open friend family volunteering strong social connection medical health laundry list long tough grapple couple week pure hell make realize really working one thing strongly done really move forward last year feel like really reached huge step since started therapy 2015 going four year life changing healthy step taken last summer dental health became overwhelming something must take care went back first appointment year gradually took care pain rot mouth wa alleviated lost tooth process huge weight wa lifted well need similar weight lifted want able reach crave discipline dental work came result time running reactive proactive want strong enough work thru shit healthy pace leave thing go awry month end consequence happens suppose order get first admit weak need help like tell must really like get exercise bike see positive cardio health body positivity motivation hike overall getting shape someone healthy buying bike putting research going store asking people advice would doable simple task like fucking hard healthy get ask sister take shopping one day post good start question failed past talk doable step remind positive outcome working thru maybe need meditate breathe thru pressure chest think going bike store talking people craigslist wish could work thru thing easily like normal person guess win today admitting broken depression fault maybe admit often see ok ask help beat le never really lost love know good man therapist told purpose looked two half right happy self philosophy depressed person good time accept healthy enough good yet least degree hope future hold hard reconcile much depression holding back hope look mirror deeply next little reach help need pick ground maybe start exercise bike,still struggle admitting need help,outside itcz

"This is all too much for me today, I want to disappear for a while","I've struggled with major depressive disorder for years now, I was officially diagnosed in 2016 but I know I had it for about 5 years before that at least. I've had a suicide attempt (right before officially being diagnosed) and since have had ups and downs... the downs happen about every other year.

Tonight I'm sitting at work, wanting to run away, cry, and hide. I've been doing fairly good lately but I just received life changing news a few nights ago, and I am not ready for this change.

I told my SO exactly how I feel and what I want (well maybe I should say don't want), which was relieving and helped me feel better for a few minutes but now I'm back to stressed out and wanting to cry. I'm worried he secretly hates that I don't want the change. Will he break up with me even though we are engaged and haven't had any issues? I hope not.. he always tells me he wants me to be honest with him and not keep things from him, so I'm trying to be open/honest but I know he doesn't enjoy hearing my honest opinions and feelings at times.

How can you bring a child into the world though when both parents would be in debt, one is jobless, we aren't even married yet, I struggle with my mental health/anxiety regarding everything about having a kid even all the crap before they are born, and one parent is a registered sex offender still on probation???

I can't do this. I was hopeful for the first couple of days... but then i started considering more about our situation and how we are NOT ready. I haven't tols many people at all, but I told him today if I can't abort it then I want to seriously give it up for adoption. I just can't. 

Call me irresponsible for not being more careful. I try to have the mentality of ""everything happens for a reason"" but I can feel myself falling apart mentally. Work helps distract me to a degree but there is a lot of downtime tonight and I keep ruminating and feeling down. I'm also pretty sure I'm too far along to get an abortion and it isn't like we can afford it anyway. FML :( :( :(

Can't seem to catch a break,"Just as my month long problem was slowly coming to an end and thing's were looking somewhat up for me more stress and worry has been thrown at me.   


After a month of stressing over getting back into my main group of friends who decided some separation would benefit everyone I learn that I was likely not going to be welcomed back...least not by the few members who genuinely didn't like me. My closest friend had a heart to heart with me about it and even though it still hurts losing the only place I felt I could relax and enjoy myself I was starting to let it go now that I knew I didn't have to worry about coming back. Still have some hangups about it all but again it was all getting better.  


Then I dont here from my Girlfriend for 3 days, finally getting a message from her the day after my birthday with her saying she's dealing with stuff and that none of its my fault and that I didnt do anything. She wont talk to me about it whatever it is and I know its bad cause she isn't acting like herself. Part of me is afraid it has to do with me but isn't my fault. I talked with a close friend and I was able to regain some of my reasoning to eventually tell her that until she wants to talk with me I'll leave her be and give her space to think. But it's still a bit disheartening that she doesn't say I love you back...its been 2 insistence and the second time she just said ""You Too"" so maybe she's just distracted by her thoughts and forgot.   


This year has been the saddest year of all for me, I wont say depressing cause I haven't been diagnosed, and I'm just hoping these feelings go away cause I'm not myself and that annoys me to no end. I'm the guy who helps others, talks them through their issues, makes people laugh, makes others happy. I'm not the sad, whimpering, insecure, paranoid guy I'm acting like...

An ode to grief,"I just made a journal entry and I thought I could share it to see if it helps anyone going through grief stages. 

There’s something that happens to a person when a piece of your soul passes away. You realize that you’re in denial all this time. That something you never thought you would want becomes something you realized you pushed away into the ignorant side of your mind so you wouldn’t think about it. So yes, a part of my soul is gone. And I’ve been trying to numb that pain that is beyond any kind of description. I feel like I had something precious that was ripped out of my hands and lit on fire to burn. Something that was alive and part of me burned and I could feel that slow, painful burn. Like watching someone you love get tortured by some unknown entity. This results in the stages of grief.... there’s denial. Which I already had since I was a child. I grew up in ignorant bliss. Not wanting to acknowledge what I knew was true. 
The there was anger. This nasty creature that you create to get back at whatever hurt you. And it will literally drive you mad. Crazy, trying to show others how much someone hurt you. Trying to find something called “closure” ( which by the way is the only fairytale or myth that you will ever hear. Closure is the only thing in the world that is impossible). Now you’re stuck in this miserable monster. You wonder how you’ll escape alive and some never do. I’m sorry for the ones who were the center of my anger and unclearity. You did not deserve what I gave you from my period of grief.
Then you bargain. For the sake of whatever sanity you may have left. You bargain for hope, freedom, and whatever else that you have. It’s not a lot. But regardless you bargain just the same. You try to find people who will help and love you unconditionally. Then you realize that they can’t enable the grief anymore than you can. You’re left alone again. Wondering who the hell you have become because it just isn’t you anymore. You’ve become this sad and hopeless mess of a person. The people you love love you so much they can’t take your struggling any more that you can. That’s when your soul dies a little more.
Then there is depression. That’s there through y’all of the stages. That feeling of NO motivation. No life. It’s an empty void but filled with all the feeling mentioned prior. Depression makes you remember your not the only one. You are made of many sad and hurting people who just want some sort of clarity. They just question every day “ why? What can I do? Why am I feeling these things.” This makes you wonder if your feelings are even ok to feel. 
Supposedly, there is acceptance.... I have not gotten there yet. Most with depression haven’t. Good luck to all of us. This is that bridge that we have not crossed and some (myself) are very afraid to cross it. It means that we will be ok. And sometimes that’s really scary because we don’t always know how to feel ok anymore. We have the beautiful loved ones that have been there no matter what. They want our success and happiness. A deep part of our soul wants that too.... the part that is still alive. We forget that part don’t we? My beautiful friends. There is a soul in our bodies. One that has not been ripped away. One that cannot be taken from an ugly thing such as grief. Every day that we are here. Together. Let’s reach out to the part of our soul that has survived. And let us remember that we are more than our grief and suffering.

First session with new counsellor and it was... weird,"Ok so while this is definitely not my first time going to counseling, this was the first meeting with a new counsellor. It was set up through my work's EAP service, which I've used before with limited success. 

Anyway, I had my first session this week and it was weird. First of all, it was in a very unconventional location. It was in an office (I mean literally a room with a desk and some office chairs), inside an organization not typically known for mental health services. So that was weird and it took me a while to get comfortable enough to start talking. 

Since this was the first session, most of it was just me explaining what was going on in my life and why I'm there. Anyway, near the end she remarked that I was a fascinating person and she really wants to talk to me more. That's my first time hearing that, especially from a professional. Then she asked me if I was familiar with the mbti, to which I replied I am not a fan. She also suggested I check out metaphysics because it might help me or something. 

I Dunno , I walked out of there feeling strange. On one hand, the counselor was nice and all, but on the other hand, certain things made me a bit uncomfortable.

how do you regain self-worth,"throwaway:)

As the title says, I am a very insecure person. I have grown up with parents who gave little affection to me and a narcissistic father who has crushed any self worth I have. Throughout middle and high school, I was popular but at the same time, I was never anyone's favorite person. I thought it was because I never had freedom or a phone during those times. I managed to escape and go to school away from my parents in college, but if anything, I have become even worse. I am so desperately afraid of losing the friends that I have made, in particular, someone who is the FIRST person in my life to have feelings for me. He knows me like the back of my hand, but now that we are doing long distance, it's naturally just harder and sometimes I come off as insecure when I ask him things. Most of the time, he is the only one I talk to about many things such as my parents which many don't understand. I just really don't want to lose him and he has said that he is tired of me being insecure, but I am naturally just not that special or pretty or smart and I can't help it. I wasn't like this when I met him, but I can't stop thinking about how he's going to find someone infinitely better when he starts his new job soon and never look at me again.

I am in college so I have little time for hobbies but I still read and work out in my free time. Most of the time I am studying, but I barely get by in school and can't land an internship for the summer.

I'm worried about the immediate future.,"I felt too overwhelmed balancing graduate-level schoolwork and a paid internship, and I felt like I wasn't getting as much done as I would have liked, wasting a lot of time. So I asked my advisor via email if I could end my contract early, for the research position I was given. 

He accepted the resignation, but I've been nervous bringing it up for weeks now. I was worried because I've been coming in late or on some days not at all. My depression is getting worse, and I feel like my antidepressant dosage is too low to be effective. I'm not sure which is a bigger black mark on my resume/needing a future recommendation for a job: not showing up to work because I'm having a depressive episode, or ending the internship to spare them from further episodes. 

It's the first time I've been employed as a STEM major, and I've completely messed it up. I only have rent money left and then, who knows. I feel so shitty and small, and mostly stupid. I can't possibly say that I've changed my mind now, it'll look too odd after all the rigamarole I went through trying to quit, emailing various advisors and internship coordinators. 

I'm so tired, and my boyfriend thinks that I've shot myself in the foot and yelled in disbelief. ""I don't know how to make it better,"" he said. 

I just don't know what to do. And I'm not sure what's more screwed up now, my financial status or my career path when grad school is over.",crashboxer1678,0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/fdn6bj/resigned_from_my_paid_internship_today_im_worried/,felt overwhelmed balancing graduate level schoolwork paid internship felt like getting much done would liked wasting lot time asked advisor via email could end contract early research position wa given accepted resignation nervous bringing week wa worried coming late day depression getting worse feel like antidepressant dosage low effective sure bigger black mark resume needing future recommendation job showing work depressive episode ending internship spare episode first time employed stem major completely messed rent money left know feel shitty small mostly stupid possibly say changed mind look odd rigamarole went trying quit emailing various advisor internship coordinator tired boyfriend think shot foot yelled disbelief know make better said know sure screwed financial status career path grad school,resigned paid internship today worried immediate future,crash boxer 1678

I don't want to work hard,"I just don't. I feel so empty whenever I think about quitting playing videogames and smoking weed. I feel so, so burdened by having to learn things and develop skills. This is why I can't go back to school, because to be successful in school I'd have to start practicing a lot of new skills. I hate practicing skills. I hate practicing writing. I hate reading just for the sake of reading and self improvement. 

I don't care if I technically get better at stuff. It doesn't make me feel any better and it's actually a cause of suffering for me. Learning new things and going out of my way to practice skills is so un-enticing to me, that I legitimately believe my life has no hope and I'd rather be dead. There is no reward. No reward can give me back the time I lose to working diligently at something. And everything is so fucking boring. Knowing that I have to suck it up and literally CHOOSE to like things like hard work just make me want to go on a killing spree. It feels like a grave injustice. It's too late for me. I've played the videogames. I've smoked the weed. For years. I no longer reap ANY pleasure from hard work, from building connections, from sitting and reading, from studying; all this shit does is make me agitated and bored, but also hopeless, because there is no hope for me. There's no hope because I DO NOT WANT TO WORK. And I'm not talking about a fucking job. I'm talking about fucking EVERYTHING. I don't want to solve challenges in my life. No matter how hard I work anyways, nothing comes ANY fucking easier. Absolutely NOTHING. Not physically writing, not physically walking, not physically talking, none of it ever becomes second nature.

Here,"When my ego dies, will it take me with it?

It's a selfish creature. It needs to be the best. It needs to be important. It needs people to agree with it. It throws tantrums. It lashes out when it's made to feel small. It thrives when it elevates itself above others. It thrives when it acts as if I am its personal chariot. It beats me down, demanding more than I could ever give. It piles on while I lie on the floor. It lives in a fantasy world full of delusion and self importance. But I withstand. I persist. It's all I know. It hurts. I suffer at its hands. I'm blinded.

Same shit as everything else in this sub,"I have been having more and more chest pains while I have a heart condition. I’ve been to the ER for it before but at this point as much as I want to live I don’t think I’ll ever be happy living. The more I’ve been thinking more about the world and people the more I realize how little control we have. We are attracted to people because that’s who our environment and biology tells us to be attracted to, we do actions based on the same two things. As you can probably tell I’m a hard determinist. I don’t believe anyone is special, I don’t believe in love. Most days I have slivers of happiness but those slivers are over come with feelings of extreme loneliness. When I say slivers I mean a second or two followed by a dive into the abyss of sadness. Anyone I think I actually connect to leaves. I don’t blame them either. I’m talking to this women who tells me that kissing for her is not cheating. I tried to understand why I would feel bad if someone I was with kisses someone else, is it my insecurity, is it my fear they will leave (under the umbrella of insecurity, I realize) idk. She tells me each connection you have is special but I’m thinking if they’re all special, then, none of them are. And if this connection was so special why would the person sever it. I mean there might be a multitude of reasons but at the end of the day it becomes as if that “special” person doesn’t exist anymore. But, if y’all do manage to keep talking how does one person not feel the pain. I guess you both have to be in healthy relationships on your own (that could end at any moment) and have to not depend on a relationship. Isn’t our end goal to produce viable offspring though. So wouldn’t we be working, looking good, exercising all to make us an appealing mate. Is there any authenticity if you have no control over the people you bond with and they don’t either. Is their anyone special out there to face the cruel oblivion with or are we, more so am I, destined to feel alone for the rest of my life. Ugh I hate this, I feel like shit and lonely but logic my way out of it but still feel like fucking garbage :( if we meet someone special shouldn’t that be enough to make us happy, since some people never feel that. So we should be happy for being lucky, I mean I guess. Jesus, why can’t I just be happy

Life is tough,"I don't know if this belongs here and I apologize if it doesn't. This post is meant to be rhetorical. No additional details will be provided and no feedback is required. Just getting some thoughts out of my head in hopes my brain can find a little peace.

Recently I've been dealing with a lot of negativity. I'm in jeopardy of losing my family due to some actions I've taken/decisions I've made. My girlfriend and her two little boys have given my life purpose. Before they became my life I would spend more nights at the bar than not, simply because it was something to do. I didn't do this to pick up chicks or anything, it just was better than sitting at home. If I lose them I don't really know what I would do with my life.

There's a quote from Ernest Hemingway that goes ""Every man has two deaths, when he is buried in the ground and the last time someone says his name.""  I am by no means contemplating suicide or being buried. It got me thinking about completely severing ties with everyone I've ever known and starting life over somewhere else though. Essentially burying the life I've had so far.

How long would it take before my friends and family stop trying to find me? How long before I'm not a daily/weekly/monthly thought on their mind? How long before I'm a distant memory or not a memory at all. Could I even do it? I already go weeks without talking to my parents. Longer without talking to my family. Random amounts of time without talking to friends. There's few people I talk to daily and the only person I can say I talk to daily with 100% certainty is my girlfriend. 

I wonder if I could truly run away from it all and start a new life if the life I have now falls apart. Could I manage to find a new purpose that wouldn't be caught in the shadow of the purpose I feel now?",anon8372627383,0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/fdpmwh/life_is_tough/,know belongs apologize post meant rhetorical additional detail provided feedback required getting thought head hope brain find little peace recently dealing lot negativity jeopardy losing family due action taken decision made girlfriend two little boy given life purpose became life would spend night bar simply wa something pick chick anything wa better sitting home lose really know would life quote ernest hemingway go every man ha two death buried ground last time someone say name mean contemplating suicide buried got thinking completely severing tie everyone ever known starting life somewhere else though essentially burying life far long would take friend family stop trying find long daily weekly monthly thought mind long distant memory memory could even already go week without talking parent longer without talking family random amount time without talking friend people talk daily person say talk daily 100 certainty girlfriend wonder could truly run away start new life life fall apart could manage find new purpose caught shadow purpose feel,life tough,8372627383

Dating While Depressed?,"So to put the question into context so everyone can understand where I'm coming from. I've been dealing with depression and anxiety for years, really fucked up childhood but some better took me in when I was a preteen so that helped but I still feel everything. Now I've been to therapy a couple times and they helped but that was when my insurance covered it now it doesn't so I don't have a therapist. I'm debating on getting onto some meds and seeing a psychiatrist. Anyways point is can I date if I'm making steps to get better? I'm a 21 ginger virgin male with lots of insecurities and depression doesn't help. In fact I'm worried I have bi polar disorder because my symptoms fall into that category more so than MDD. My point is I constantly feel like any woman can and should do better than me. I have this crippling feeling every time I like a girl I think ""just stop, they can do better leave her alone"" literally ALL my friends are in relationships and I want it so bad. I want what they have but I have little to no experience, the one ego boost I have is I was once told I was the best kisser she's ever met and she been around the block a couple times. I'll be honest I miss her to, she was someone I would've been willing to lose the V to and risk the rejection because she was so nice and one of the most non judgmental people I've ever met and she was a nerd to lol. She moved States for school so our fun was cut short.  Should I try to date? It's really hard for me since I've never been in love and don't know what to look for. I also wanna get the virgin thing outta the way so I'm not one when I'm 40. Fuck society and it's social stigmas, they're impossible not to follow it seems. I just don't see how I can date if I'll have these feelings for a few more years and I don't want to be 30 year old man with no experience either.

I got a hotel room here in my town because I needed a time for myself.,"Look, I love my family and they're awesome. But, sometimes, I need to be alone. I like being alone. My relatives have been living with me for a while now (ever since March, can you guess why?) and as someone who's been living alone for a while now it's getting pretty hard. 

I told my parents, uncles, and grandparents the truth. I bought a new book and it has just arrived, but I still haven't had the chance to read it because of them. There's no peace and quiet around them. They're the party hard kind and I'm more introverted. 

We haven't left the house in months, I really need this. I spent the day cleaning up after them because one of my two uncles insisted on making breakfast. Honestly, yeah, it was good. But, damn, no pancakes are worth that mess. He did help me, but I'm just so tired. That was the straw that broke the camel's back. After we were done with the dishes, I turned on my computer and booked a room for three days.

Your height is totally fine,"Lately I’ve noticed many guys around my circle and on the internet that are very self conscious about how tall they are. And that they often, unfortunately made bad experiences with girls who only date „super tall“ i.e. at least 6‘ guys. Whose girls, are not people who you want to be with. 

Let me just say to you, that it truly does not matter how tall you guys are. Really. In the end, it comes down to what kind of person you are. If they can’t appreciate you then they are not worth it. And if they reject you for that only then you are not the „problem“. 

I mean as a 5‘ girl I couldn’t care less how tall you are. So don’t beat yourselves up! 

Anyways, I hope you guys stay safe!

Edit: for my fellow Europeans 6‘ is about 182cm and 5‘ is about 150-155 cm

Edit 2: For all the tall women comes a similar stigma just the over way around. Either way you are valid and nothing less! If people can’t appreciate you for who you are they are not nice people!

Edit 3: Yes, it is totally fine to have preferences! Maybe I phrase it a lil shitty (English is not my main language) but and I mean BUT, when you make someone feel like they are not valid because of something they can’t control is not nice! (it’s just my opinion, feel free to disagree/criticise)

Edit 4: I tried to respond to everyone as much as I could but at this point I wish you all well! And sorry if I don’t respond to everyone’s message! 

Edit 5: And don’t shy away to criticise, some things are not obvious to me and I can always learn from others. Seeing others perspectives can be very helpful!

I remember this conversation with an old acquaintance years ago and it changed me,"I was at a Halloween party with my best friend, Chelsea, and she had some other friends over. This girl Michelle and I were talking and I was telling her and Chelsea a story. I can’t even remember what story it was, but half way through Chelsea said “you already told us this!” She didn’t mean it harshly at all, she likes to play

And then I remembered I told them the same story and they were both in front of me! So I was like Michelle, why didn’t you stop me sooner? 

Her reply was so sweet. She said, “well, if someone tells me something for a 2nd or 3rd time, clearly they care a lot about the story or fact so of course I’m gonna listen and act like it’s the first time I’ve ever heard it because it must mean a lot to them if they talk about it often”

And since then I have made it a point to do the same. I just thought it was so sweet and I want to listen to everyone to make them happy, too.

I asked a woman if she was OK today,"I know the title sounds fairly boring or inane, but it means more than that to me. 

I walked by a woman in a wheelchair sitting on the side of the road today. She was just far enough off the road to be in the shade so I didn't think much of it at first and went about my day.

When I was returning the other way about half an hour later I noticed she was still in the same place. She had a sullen look on her face and didn't seem happy.

My mother was sick and in a wheelchair for years although she was in a home for most of that time. She passed years ago, but this situation just reminded me far too much about what would've happened if she had to get around in a chair.

I stopped to ask the woman if she was OK - no more and no less - I didn't want to offend her or her independence in case I was completely wrong.

To my surprise her face lit up and she said she was fine and thanked me for asking her. I'm so glad I did.

"Today I taught my coworker how to play rock, paper, scissors.","I am European, but I'm also lucky enough to work in a very international environment.

My Bangladeshi coworker came up to me all blushy and shy and told me how he saw this guy in a vlog playing rock, paper, scissors on the street and he was wondering if I could teach him how to play the game.

It feels so good to be happy.,"The past few years I’ve spent a lot of time going through my own internal issues that I never really told anyone about. Guess I just never wanted to be a burden, or I didn’t feel I could trust anyone enough to confide in them. Either way, I finally feel really happy. Moved out of my home for the first time and I’m living in the city of my dreams. I don’t really have any friends here yet but I’m the happiest I’ve been since, like forever. Typically when I go back through old photos/videos from the past few years, I kind of mentally grimace knowing the pain I was going through at the time, and being okay with it. I’m looking forward to remembering this current time in my life and smiling to myself, because I know I’ll remember it fondly. I finally don’t have to lie about how I’m feeling. I read that line a few times over after writing it, that’s the first time I realized that. I hope whoever reads this is happy too, and if you’re struggling with your own issues,  just know that you’re not alone, and there is a way out. It might take a while, but it’s well worth the wait.

I am 60 years old. But somehow I am still the baby of the family,"I have two older sisters. The oldest one has always been very mother-like to me. 

And the other day I walked to the park and I saw a nice little scene. It was a pond with the moon reflection so I just took a picture. Sent it in the group chat I have with my family.

Well cue my sister “Why are you out it’s LATE and look where you are it is dark over there you should be careful it’s gonna rain tonight where is your umbrella do you want to catch a cold because that’s how you catch a cold-“

So I said “Relax I am fine.”

I played chess with a drunk German guy online.,"I’m an American Soldier. Last night I was enjoying my Saturday night by playing some online chess, as I frequently do. 

One of my opponents turned out to be a German student and we struck up a decent conversation in the chat box while we played a few games. He was 20 and I am 21, and we both shared common interests and goals. It was just kind of surreal to me to think about how much both society and technology has advanced in so little time.. 

If I were to tell my grandfather that 70 years after WW2 I would be playing chess with a German kid across the world I’m sure that would have blown his mind haha

"I wish I had a hobby that I could totally devote my life to, like old guys with model trains.","I was looking at hobby magazines the other day. They're mostly aimed at boomers and similar generations, but I think they're so cool. One, for example, was full of images and articles about model trains and environments.

I just threw away half of the birthday cake that I made for my friends’ joined birthday. It’s gone bad and one of them hasn’t even tried it.,"I poured my heart into making this big birthday cake, with fancy chocolatey decorations and all, carefully planned the recipe to their liking. It took me almost 4 hours to make. I thought it looked really pretty. I think birthday cakes are the hardest to make, because the cream is so messy and it’s hard to actually make it look nice. So as all my friends know me as the “baker” or “dessert girl”, I only make birthday cakes for the closest friends. I know that birthday cakes from where we live are either super expensive or super shitty, so I made sure to make one for them so they would have a cake on their birthday.

Today I just had to throw half of the cake away because it has gone bad, and I feel so terrible. One of the 2 birthday friends ate a piece, and the other hasn’t come by to try. I guess they didn’t mean to do it, just busy with their lives and didn’t have the chance to come over to my place to eat the cake. They have their other reasons, actually good reasons.. but idk why i can’t help but crying so hard when I threw the cake in the trash bin. It hurts even more when I saw one of them posted on insta about a cake that another friend made for him, brought it to his house, and wrote how much he loved it. I promise myself I would never make a birthday cake for anyone anymore... I’m getting so emotional over a fucking cake.

A story about the nicest homeless man I met,"I remember being 14, wandering downtown Ottawa and feening for a cigarette. I would often homeless people to bum me one on exchange for a few dollars (they were usually more than happy to do so). On this night, it was around 10pm and I asked a homeless man on the street if he had a backwood to spare for $10. He told me they were empty (he had a open brief case with wrappers) but would by me a pack of smokes from the corner store. I tossed him $20 bucks and he told me to watch his property bag while he went to the store (he just got out of jail). I talked to his friend, he told me the story of their arrest, telling me they loved jail since it was warmer than sleeping outside. When the man returned, he handed me the pack, with the full change and receipt. At the time, I wouldn't have been surprised if he ran off with the money (that was wrong of me). I was so touched, I left him with half the pack, the rest of the $20 and my hat since it was mid-winter. Ever since then, I would donate my change to every homeless person I see.

"I used to resent myself for being so honest/blunt, now I understand it’s a blessing in disguise.","My whole life I’ve had no filter. When I was young I’d accidentally hurt peoples feelings or astound adults with my intricate and deep opinions all the time. 
I never felt like I needed to hold back what I was thinking so I would just say it with my chest. This got me in trouble a lot and I never really understood why.
Now I’m an adult and I’m in a long term relationship, college, job, etc. I have found myself very quiet and apologetic in past years because I am worried that my quick tongue would ruin my relationships or reputation one day. My brain instantly fires off all these responses and emotions the second I’m in a situation that wants an answer but I often withhold —hoping someone else can do it.

RECENTLY... I’ve realized that my responses are well thought out and appropriate most of the time. What I have to say would enrich the conversation and when I don’t say it I’m actually a downer. I can’t be perfect and I most certainly won’t get anywhere if I can’t grow enough backbone to speak up when I want too. Ergo...

**If I have to, I should apologize for the tone in which I say things that offends people, but not for what I’m saying.**

Another thing is that I kinda want long hair for college just so I'm not growing it out awkwardly if I shave it now (who knows, maybe wouldn't even grow it back out).

I have face blindness and face masks have made it worse,"I have hard time recognising people, once a university did tests on me about it, for real. To recognise people I have to use things such as hair style, skin tone, usual clothes, or my favourite: voice, sometimes it's like I have not seen someone until I hear them

That said there are some people whose faces I can recognise, like my family and friends... that was until the face mask era.

Just today we were going somewhere and I fell behind form the group, I was distracted with something else, then I caught up and continued walking until this person I thought I knew said: ""Do you need anything?"" and from the voice I realised I didn't know this person. She just happened to have the same hair style and similar clothes to a friend of mine

I apologised and started scanning the scene for my friends, but there were many people all around with features that my mind registered as them. I could have used clothes, but I didn't pay too much attention to what they were wearing, you'd think I'd know to always pay attention to that by now.

I was feeling lost when someone approached me. I thought that she had realised I was worried and was going to offer me help. I was thinking how I would explain the situation but then she said: ""What are you doing?, we are waiting for you"" and I realised it was my friend

A classmate in middle school changed how I view myself.,"I have been thinking about this a lot lately. I am very much a pushover, ever since I was a child. I say I am sorry so many times a day for things I have no reason to be sorry for. I have let friends, family, partners, and nearly anyone else push me around and rarely had the confidence to stand up for myself.

Back in middle school, I met a girl when I started 6th grade. We were in the same class and from the moment I met her, she just rubbed me the wrong way. She was outgoing and funny, I was quiet and shy. She could get along with anyone and everyone, I barely had one friend, who I feel was mainly friends with me because I would let her do whatever she wanted. The new girl ( I will call her C) started in on me after about a week of school. She would loudly include me in conversations with other people I wasnt comfortable with. She gave me a nickname due to my pale skin and red  hair that I felt was malicious. Small things like this went on until about halfway through 7th grade.

C greeted me in the morning ""Hey 'nickname' why do you look so crabby? Whats wrong?"" I saw this as a personal attack and finally snapped.

""C dont call me that! I dont like it, stop picking on me etc etc"" (I cant remember the exact conversation) but I had it. I was red in the face and embarrassed for speaking out immediately. She just smiled and grabbed me in a huge hug. I may not remember every detail, but I will always remember what she said next

""Finally! You finally stood up to me. You're so strong and a great person, I wanted you to stand up for yourself and see how you don't have to let people walk all over you""

I was shocked. I started to recall all the times I thought she was picking on me. She wasn't. She was trying to include me. The nickname she gave me? I then realized she gave all of her friends nicknames.

Mustard and wasabi,"In Chinese, mustard and wasabi share the same name (芥末 jie mo) so when I go to 711 I will take a lot of yellow mustard just in case I need it and when I run out of wasabi I will tell my dad that I ran out of jie mo and he would ask which colour. 

The existence of mustard confused a lot of Asian consumers lol. Some even asked if they tasted the same.

"Today, I managed to write down the complete outline of my writing project!","Calling it a novel feels weirdly pretentious, but it's getting a bit too long to be reasonably called a short story, so a project it is. 

&amp;#x200B;

I've liked to write ever since I was a kid. It was the one form of artistic expression I connected the most with, and even when I wasn't writing for one reason or another, I always felt that itch to put words to paper, to tell the story that was trapped at the back of my mind. And I want to be clear that I have no pretention to be actually good at it; hell, I don't even particularly want to get published, nor share my stuff with anyone else. I just like writing. 

&amp;#x200B;

But I've always had this problem: I'd have an idea for a setting and charcters that I loved, I'd start writing it and then I'd just... stop. Not because I'd loose interest, but because I just didn't know how to take the story further. I knew what I wanted it to look like in the end, but I had no idea how to get there. I didn't know how to build a story, really. And so, for years and years, dozens of projects have sat abandoned in my hard drive, collecting metaphorical dust because I was like a gardener with a seed and no idea how to turn it into a plant. 

&amp;#x200B;

Recently, I got fed up with this pattern. And so I figured, fuck it, if I'm not going to be naturally good at it, then I'll just have to figure it out the old-fashioned way: hard work. And that involved research. A lot of it. (By the way, there is a joke to make about someone reading a book about how to write books.) And you know what? It payed off. Learning how stories are structured - and, more importantly, that there's a method to it - was like being handed the tools and the blueprints I desperately needed to build my house. 

&amp;#x200B;

I feel like, when it comes to any kind of artistic venture, we all have this belief that talent is key, and maybe it is, but I think we also forget that most art forms are also a craft. And you can't wing a craft. Not being able to do so doesn't make you stupid, or untalented; it just means that you're a normal person that can't magically pull knowledge from the ether. 

&amp;#x200B;

After this particular bit of soul-searching, I got to work, and, lo and behold! I have the entire plot of my project planned out, all major scenes outlined with what I want them to do to move things along. It might be crap (it's probably crap; all first drafts are), but I don't even care at this point, because I actually did it. 

&amp;#x200B;

So that was my little victory of the day. I'd love to chat with you all about books or whatever thing you've managed to do today!

I didnt do 100s of pieces of homework and I have school tomorrow. Help.,"I posted this on r/offmychest but I wanted to post it here too. Here goes.

Over the course of lockdown, I've been procrastinating and only focusing on my mood and doing things I want to do like socialising with friends, playing guitar etc. Unlike most people though, when I complete work I dont feel satisfied or like I achieved something, I just feel frustrated and angry. Over some months, this became a problem. 

This past week I've been thinking: ""I wont be able to finish this amount of homework in a week, so screw it."" 

I dont know what's going to happen tomorrow and I am quite anxious. What's going to happen? Will they shout at me? What will my family think? Will I be expelled or suspended? I have only one explanation for this.

I want to live my life not being controlled or described by a grade on a sheet of paper. It's okay if I dont know a lot of general knowledge.

Grateful at a Starbucks,"I’m sitting at a Starbucks right now &amp; I just had this overwhelming feeling of gratitude when getting a whiff of a pumpkin spice latte that passed me.

When I was in University, I was utterly depressed and lost in life. I was a barista at a Starbucks during University and although I remember fun times working there, I had a lot of issues going on at home and with my relationship. At some point I was close to failing out of University too. When I started to get my shit together, I spent a lot of time at another Starbucks in a town between my Uni &amp; home to study, &amp; I had quit my barista job at the other cafe. I spent hours &amp; hours at this Starbucks studying to try to graduate. Not knowing if I even would.
After graduation, I worked at a company where I was constantly put down &amp; paid very little. When I was laid off, I had to start job hunting again. Spending every other weekend of 8 months in the Starbucks again to job hunt.

Today I sit in a Starbucks in Europe to study for a graduate course I’m taking. I’m here because my company relocated me to help open a branch of our team here, &amp; I’m in graduate school online. I’m living a life that I wouldn’t have been able to imagine just a few years ago because I just kept failing at everything I did.

I don’t want this to come off as bragging, rather just a proclamation of how grateful I am of where I am now. My friends often tell me I suffer from the Imposter Syndrome where I never acknowledge that I worked hard to get where I am. But today I want to acknowledge that. I did work hard to get here, &amp; I’m proud of it. I still have many goals to achieve. But this little moment is my moment of gratitude &amp; acknowledgement that I didn’t succumb to the failure everyone was telling me was coming before.

Feeling grateful.
Hope everyone’s Sunday is going well.

There are bad days but at the end it all feels worth it. I feel happy and I feel like I can do it and like I can live my life from now on. And to top it off I found the love of my life. Fell in love with them the moment I saw them and they feel the same... &lt;3

A little habit I picked up while talking to non-native English speakers,"I myself am a bilingual person- I speak Hindi/Urdu along with English. Growing up in an urban, educated environment I speak fluent English and sometimes speak English better than my native tongue.

In my country English is the lingua franca and you're looked down upon if you don't speak English. I really hate this idea but its became a deeply ingrained part of our culture. A lot of times, urban rich people go out of their way to flex their English skills ie speaking with a fake American/British accent, pretending they don't understand the native language, or just being generally snobby about it. I have met preschoolers who can't speak the native language even when they throw tantrums it's in English because that's the only language they hear in their schools and homes. We maybe independent now but the colonial elitist mindset stayed behind. 

Anyway, then there also people who don't speak English that well and feel visibly self-conscious about it (mostly old people, poor urban workers, those who went to a non-English school). 

A lot of times when talking to a fluent English speaker (like me), some people make an extra effort to sound ""better"" and get nervous and fumble up. I always pick up on these cues and switch to my native language instead, in a manner that makes it seem that I too am more comfortable speaking Hindi/Urdu instead. If they don't speak my native language, I simplify my words and try to sound more natural and friendly to them.

It has worked very well till now and watching people smile in relief and hearing them express themselves better always makes me feel good.",communistpotatoes,1,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/CasualConversation/comments/io239f/a_little_habit_i_picked_up_while_talking_to/,bilingual person speak hindi urdu along english growing urban educated environment speak fluent english sometimes speak english better native tongue country english lingua franca looked upon speak english really hate idea became deeply ingrained part culture lot time urban rich people go way flex english skill ie speaking fake american british accent pretending understand native language generally snobby met preschooler speak native language even throw tantrum english language hear school home maybe independent colonial elitist mindset stayed behind anyway also people speak english well feel visibly self conscious mostly old people poor urban worker went non english school lot time talking fluent english speaker like people make extra effort sound better get nervous fumble always pick cue switch native language instead manner make seem comfortable speaking hindi urdu instead speak native language simplify word try sound natural friendly ha worked well till watching people smile relief hearing express better always make feel good,little habit picked talking non native english speaker,communist potato
Online friends are valid!,"A lot of people think that people you meet on the internet aren't the ones you can trust. What if Lara, age 19, a friend you've been talking to since two weeks is actually a guy in his thirties? Anonymity is a factor, but that shouldn't restrict you. 

I'll speak about my experience. I started making online friends probably around last year. It was difficult for me to trust people. But after a few hits and misses, I did end up making good friends from different parts of my country! One even travelled a long distance to meet me on my birthday last year. This year, getting more comfortable, I made tons of online friends on Twitter. They have been nothing but supportive! Sometimes I find more warmth in them than people who I meet daily. 

When I needed someone to talk to, my friends from Twitter helped me. They offered me support and advice. I'm sure that most of my IRL friends won't listen to me (well some would). 

The other day I was talking to my college friends about my online friends. Some of them were mortified that I let a person from the internet crash at my place on my birthday. It was something new, a gamble, but it paid off well. 

I have talked to some of the best and most interesting people online.

College parties,"So I was never a party person in highschool, I only went to a few kickbacks with my football team in highschool, and it wasnt anything big.

But now that I'm starting college, eell community college this year, im getting lowkey hyped to go to a party.

I have this thing where I can not go to sleep if the house is messy or things are out of place- and the dishes can not be piled up in the sink,"So here I am at 1 am. My body is in complete agony because I haven't stopped since my boyfriend has moved in.

I have a love/hate relationship with this part of myself because it keeps my place clean and me motivated but I just can not bring myself to stop when it comes to a point and then I'm exhausted and my body hurts.

Empathy and helping others feel really great and it's probably one of the most important things in life,"I probably am stating a huge cliché. It's not even something I'm just thinking for the first time but today Reddit made me realize, once again, how important and fulfilling empathy is and how helping others can help us too.

I used to come here more to rent about something, share the things that were bothering me in my life that for some reason would not share with the people in my life and it felt nice to always have some comforting words. Of course I ended up joining very other different subs, some just for laughing, some where I learned something and it's really great to belong to these communities. (I am deliberately ignoring when there are trolls or mean comments... Let's stick with the positive).

Today I needed to vent some things and then I ended up showing some empathy on posts of people on those subs that were struggling with their stuff, and now I feel lighter both because of the kind feeeback I got but also because I at least got to tell someone that they were not the only one experiencing some hard thing.

I felt like sharing this and thought this was a good sub for it. It also reminded me of a topic in high school Philosophy. I can't remember the authors now but I recall that we debated if there could be purely altruistic gestures because when we feel good about helping someone it automatically becomes selfish too.

Made a new kitty friend,"A few week ago, my sweetie was up late watching tv and had the door open to let in a cool night breeze (we have a screen door so bugs don’t come in). All of a sudden, he gets quite a scare when some unseen force thumps on the screen door! And then up pops this little kitty face, paws up on the door and all. Well, after his heart stopped racing he went out into the front stoop to meet this kitty visitor who is very sweet and playful, rolling around and just generally being cute. Well, he takes some pics and videos and shows me the next morning and I am DEVASTATED bc I was asleep and missed the whole thing! 

Earlier this week, almost a month later, kitty comes back! Sweetie texts me, saying “I know you’ve just gone up to bed, but kitty visitor is back!” So I jump out of bed, throw on a sweater and go to meet our late-night guest. Now something to note at this point is that I am not really a cat person. I didn’t grow up with cats, and I find them a bit unnerving and unpredictable. But oh my god. This cat!!! It just love to come and rub against us, meows and chit chats with us, and is generally so cute and floppy and sweet!

Today I found out that I have a sister somewhere out there and there is basically a 0% I will ever find her,"Well today was supposed to be a normal day. I was going to go on a hike and enjoy the nice weather but I got blindsided with some news that I wasn't expecting. 

I live away from home but my teen brother still lives with my mom and dad. He pretty much just called me out of the blue today upset about some news my dad shared with him. Basically when my dad was young and in college he dated a girl very briefly. They break up when my dad dropped out of school and moved away and soon after she found out she was pregnant. She asked my dad to come back and confirm it's his, and she swore up and down that it was. He said no. He didn't want to know and didn't sign up for it.

Fast forward and the baby girl is born. The mother is on her own and called my dad to let him know. She asked him to come at least see the baby. He said no again. She tells him the little girls name anyway and they had an argument because the mother decided to put the baby up for adoption.

Then basically my dad moved on and never heard from them again. I don't know why he decided to tell my brother or why he did what he did. He was young and too immature I guess but it's just kind of shocking. Our family is still complete and fairly close together so it's kind of hard to imagine I have a sister out there who my dad basically abandoned.

The hardest part is that there is 0% chance my brother and I will find her. Her name was super common, she was born in a state 8 hours away, and was put up for adoption too. She would be in her 30s now if she is alive. My dad didn't answer all of my brothers questions about it either.

I don't want help finding her it's just hard to take all of this on so suddenly. 2020 has been weird, man.

As a side note my dad is an honest and trustworthy man now. He is retired and basically the most kind hearted soul i've known. He has done a lot for my family, more than I know for sure. I guess it just goes to show people can change or something idk.",Terarri,7,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/CasualConversation/comments/inu4t4/today_i_found_out_that_i_have_a_sister_somewhere/,well today wa supposed normal day wa going go hike enjoy nice weather got blindsided news expecting live away home teen brother still life mom dad pretty much called blue today upset news dad shared basically dad wa young college dated girl briefly break dad dropped school moved away soon found wa pregnant asked dad come back confirm swore wa said want know sign fast forward baby girl born mother called dad let know asked come least see baby said tell little girl name anyway argument mother decided put baby adoption basically dad moved never heard know decided tell brother wa young immature guess kind shocking family still complete fairly close together kind hard imagine sister dad basically abandoned hardest part 0 chance brother find name wa super common wa born state 8 hour away wa put adoption would 30 alive dad answer brother question either want help finding hard take suddenly 2020 ha weird man side note dad honest trustworthy man retired basically kind hearted soul known ha done lot family know sure guess go show people change something idk,today found sister somewhere basically 0 ever find,ter arr
My Potential Roommate is being difficult,"Ok i know the title off the bat sounds like i’m the mean roommate. But hear me out, so i’m starting college in far from home, and our university puts out a list of people that need roommates. Other people already had roommates and there’s was one girl left, she contacted me. So we started of well, we discussed apartments that had a good low cost we could evenly split. My flight date is arriving earlier then hers, so first thing that happens is she tells me to stay in a hotel so I can check out the apartment, finalize it tell her about it then move in and she can come move into the apartment later - I told her i can’t do that because i’m trying to maintain a budget plus the hotel thing will be harder since i’m going to be alone in a new place - She didn’t reply for 2 days. After that she told me her uncle lives there and he will check out the apartment- he checks it out and tells me the apartment is nice so we settle on it but we still haven’t made the payments - she again tells me that i should stay in the hotel for a few days and finalize it like that. - i tried explaining again that i can’t do that but if this isn’t working out for her then she should let me know so i can make out living arrangements. She agrees to no hotel and told me she’ll give me a reply about the apartment in two days - i also told her that please actually let me know in 2 days because my flight leave three days AFTER that. It’s been three days now and my flight is the day after tmr and we still haven’t made the payments - I texted her about an update and she left me on read. So i have no living arrangements and i get there in two days - only reason i do not want to pay for residence is because that will cost me $1000 monthly but the apartment cost split evenly between us will only cost me $630. I have contacted many other people to see if they’re looking for roommates but they aren’t so i don’t even know what to do anymore. Am i being unreasonable or doing something stupid???

I know everyone says oh fuck what other people think, follow your heart, etc, but that's a lot easier said than done. Maybe I just care too much because I've been living at home with them for the past six months cause covid, and once I get out on my own again that'll change.

The least toxic sport,"I've played a lot of sports growing up, soccer, basketball, hockey, lacrosse, swimming, and track/cross country.

I can say that the one with the least toxic people is the track and swimming. OMG, sometimes it's just ridiculous. I can't even count the amount of times we'll talk shit to the other team, or the other team will talk shit to us. Even the coaches do this.

Our team gets in a fight pretty much every season with a opposing team. It's crazy and totally unnecessary. IT'S A FUCKING GAME! CALM YOUR TITS!

However, my personal favorite is cross country because of how all the runners respect each other. Sometimes, when we're waiting at the start line, we'll even joke with the opposing runners to lighten the mood. It's a good time.

And there's no hard feelings when you get beat in a race. If anything, for me it's a good feeling.

What is a good 'parent sanity friendly' present to surprise my buddy's 5 y/o son with?,"I'm a 31 y/o single dude with no kids but my best friend has two kids (5y/o son, 2 y/o daughter). I would like to surprise his son (who I essentially consider to be my nephew) with a present but I'd like to get something that won't irritate my buddy or his wife. Like, you know how some toys are just loud and obnoxious? I don't want to get anything like that. So nothing that is super noisy or has a lot of pieces to it but something the young fella will enjoy. He is big into dinosaurs and animals, in general. But since he is five-years-old, I'm not looking to get him like a stuffed animal or anything like that. 

Preferably any suggestion would be like $20-$50 because I am no Bill Gates but I'm not opposed to splurging on a cool present for the kid. I know my buddy is under a lot of pressure with work and raising a young family and all that so I would just like to surprise his kiddo with a random gift and look like a cool uncle, you know what I mean?

You ever just have those days when the tempo of all the songs you listen to seems off?,"You know those little periods of time when the song you're listening to seems to be too fast or too slow and you can't shake the feeling that it's different somehow? I get those a lot, and it's always really weird for me. It's hard to enjoy listening to a song when it slips into the musical uncanny valley and feels all wrong.

Some songs that this affects a lot for me are Treasure by Bruno Mars, which often sounds way too slow, Hotel California by The Eagles, which usually seems too slow by just enough for it to be disconcerting, and Cool for the Summer by Demi Lovato, which nearly always seems sped up to the extent that I can't really even listen to it without immediately thinking that something is wrong.

Of course, most of the time, when I listen to those songs (and others) it seems to be a-okay, but there are days when I can't listen to anything at all without the tempo feeling weird. Yesterday was one of those days, and after only an hour or so of flicking through my playlists looking for something that seemed normal, I just gave up and stopped listening to anything at all.

This is the best I’ve ever gotten along with my parents in my life,"From the ages of about 12-18, I did not get along with my parents. It was mostly just the usual teenage angst, but in high school we were having some stupid shouting match pretty much everyday. Most of it was absolutely my fault but my parents weren’t totally free of blame either. 

Now, I’m about halfway through college and living not too far from my parents’ house. Even though it really hasn’t been that long since I moved out, our dynamic is totally different now. My parents and I get along pretty great. I think me leaving the house caused my parents to simmer down a bit, and I grew up like I needed to. Don’t get me wrong, I’ve still got a lot of growing to do, but it’s kinda cool being able to realize now how much of an idiot I was just a few years ago. 

A few days ago, my parents texted me saying they were thinking of having a bonfire with my little brother that night and they wanted to see if I wanted to join. Without much thought, I agreed and drove down and we chilled and made s’mores together.

We have a Ghost Maid?,"This happened earlier tonight. I’ll try not to make this too long.

We are two college students living in a student apartment together. We both cook often and so the trash can in out kitchen fills up kind of fast.
It’s the ones with the little step on the bottom so the top opens up. 

My roommate was cooking his dinner and since the trash can was getting full he said that he was going to take it to the dumpster outside our apartment when he was done. I took out the trash at least three times before and said ok sure. Afterwards I took a shower. 

After I got out, I got a text from a friend saying if it was ok for them to come over to use the internet for work. I said ok and cleaned up my room for them to use. I noticed that the small trash can in my room was filling up so I decided to put it in the kitchen one since my roommate was going to take it out. When I stepped on the little lever to open it up, the the trash was taken out and a new bag was in. 

My first thought was “oh cool, he took out the trash, nice”. But shortly afterwards I realized he couldn’t have taken out the trash. The dumpster has a lock on it so only residents can open it. But roommates have only one trash key between us and I always have it with me. I asked if someone opened up the dumpster for him, he put it somewhere outside or had it in his room but he just said that he was in his room the entire time after he made food.

He thinks that I’m lying and I swore to him that I didn’t take it out because he said he was going to do it. We did leave the front door unlocked so someone could’ve come in. But who would come inside to change the trash? My laptop was in the living room out in the open too so they could’ve taken that instead of the trash? I really have no fucking idea. I even looked under my bed and in my closet to see if anyone snuck in while I was in the shower and my roommate was in his room. Just to let you know, we cannot have guests over due to COVID and we know absolutely no one else here except for the friend that needed to do work.

I looked up a lie detector place online and I am calling them up tomorrow. I told my roommate that I would put it on speaker so I can make an appointment to prove to him that I’m not lying and that we have a fucking ghost maid living in our apartment.

I just got what I think is a sign from the universe,"I will not say at all that I’ve had a difficult life, just that I’ve gone through some difficult things. 

I went through some pretty extreme trauma during my undergrad and had to drop out of college and abandon my dream job path (after 3 years and being a standout student). I recovered and finished my degree at another local private college, but had to settle for a similar but not practical degree. I did get to fulfill my dream of being a cheerleader for that college, which led me into becoming a professional football cheerleader. 

Still, I’ve been lost trying to find a new career path. Two years after graduation, I decided to do a Master’s in a completely different field. I’m about to start that, but money has been incredibly tight for me. I was on my last $20, being told that I was every job’s second choice after solid interviews (once I was 2nd out of 200+!), and was planning on moving back home. I was out of job leads, out of my emergency fund, and out of time. 

I’ve been praying, manifesting, and trying. Two separate employers have reached out to me and we’re speaking about part time hours. If I can get both jobs, I’ll be okay. If I can just get one, I can still figure something out. 

Today, my sign: I was still concerned about my $20 bank account. I just checked and saw $250 from the state. Apparently my taxes had been filed wrong and they owed me. 

This was just the boost I needed to hold on for these last few weeks until I can hopefully get a paycheck in. I can buy some groceries and gas (and paper towels!!) and can pick up more food for my kitten. 

This honestly feels like the universe threw me a wildcard just when I was out of options. I could cry knowing that everything will be okay in my eleventh hour. I’ve been speaking out loud saying I am grateful for my many blessings and I know the universe has a plan for me, and here we are. This $250 literally could not have come at a better time if I’d orchestrated it myself. It makes me feel like something out there is hearing me.",koala-balla,2,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/CasualConversation/comments/inozyf/i_just_got_what_i_think_is_a_sign_from_the/,say difficult life gone difficult thing went pretty extreme trauma undergrad drop college abandon dream job path 3 year standout student recovered finished degree another local private college settle similar practical degree get fulfill dream cheerleader college led becoming professional football cheerleader still lost trying find new career path two year graduation decided master completely different field start money ha incredibly tight wa last 20 told wa every job second choice solid interview wa 2nd 200 wa planning moving back home wa job lead emergency fund time praying manifesting trying two separate employer reached speaking part time hour get job okay get one still figure something today sign wa still concerned 20 bank account checked saw 250 state apparently tax filed wrong owed wa boost needed hold last week hopefully get paycheck buy grocery gas paper towel pick food kitten honestly feel like universe threw wildcard wa option could cry knowing everything okay eleventh hour speaking loud saying grateful many blessing know universe ha plan 250 literally could come better time orchestrated make feel like something hearing,got think sign universe,koala ball

An instance where a fairly insignificant gesture resulted in something significant to someone else,"Let me start by sharing one. 

In 2018, we visited Phuket for a short trip, and stayed at a 3 star hotel. Housekeeping staff was a young lady, who always had a smile and tidied up our room perfectly. 

On the day of our departure, she came to check the mini bar as part of the protocol to settle the bill. We had over stocked it with sweets, snacks, fruits and beverages. The items would have been worth at best around $10-15. We did not plan to take it with us and offered it to her. 

Her reaction blew us away. She kneeled on the floor and kissed our feet crying with tears of joy, thanking us.

That moment moved us, how such an insignificant gesture meant so much to her, moved us to this day.

"28 [M4F] New York Looking to chat with nurses, healthcare workers!!!"," 

Hello everyone. First off I would like to wish you a beautiful morning,evening,day,night wherever you may be.

I'm a 28 year old Medical student bored out of his mind; I would like to people who are married as they can offer fresh insight into lifes ups and downs. I remember having a penpal as a teenager although i wasn't too crazy about it; ive decided to give it another shot :)

I enjoy long walks at night, walks and hiking in nature, Psychologoical thriller movies, horror movies; conspiracy theories; indie music; non mainstream music; and art. I believe we can find an interest which we share in common as my interests are as vast as the universe :). I have pet snail; yes; a pet snail; hes ugly and BIG (huge actually the size of a Banana) but don't let that scare you; He won't eat you; he only eats squash :). His fav meal.

I'm a fairly open minded; friendly person; though the corona lockdown has made me become a bit of a hermit; perhaps you can help change that; let our friendship blossom into something beautiful! I look forward to hearing from you; once again wish you a colorful and wonderful day. Ciao =)

My pain tolerance has shifted,"So for a while, my body has been in lots of pain here and there. I've been working out and running for a long time so there is the constant muscle soreness. But due to where I work, tedious 40 hour a week shifts in which I lift heavy boxes and things all shift, my some of my muscles hurt and ache due to that too. At first, the pain was almost unbearable. 

But recently, I've noticed that has started to change. I've made comments to friends that ""I'm masochist as I am a full-time student and work full-time"" jokingly. But around when I started saying that, I've been increasingly more okay with the pain. Not exactly sure why. I was usually that kid who would take a Tylenol whenever any muscle felt a little off or hurt a little. But I now don't even opt to take a painkiller. I just power through it.

Somber thoughts - Middle school best friend got married,"My best friend from middle school just got married today. We aren’t really in each other’s lives anymore although we did keep up with each other via social media every few years. My mother went to her wedding and told me about some of my middle school friends and teachers who attended. Hearing about her wedding made me all nostalgic and I’ve been feeling pretty somber. She was my first real friend and I’m so grateful to her and her friendship. Since then we’ve gone on two different paths of life and I don’t think we could reconnect like that. I don’t know if we would be friends even if we tried. We’re just so different now. But I’m still so grateful for her and have so many heartfelt emotions of our friendship. I truly wish the best for her and wish her happiness and success. 

People are meant to serve different roles in different parts of your life. And she served a huge part in my middle school years. She was a friend to a lonely boy who had no friends. To a diseased boy no one wanted to associate with. She allowed me to feel loved when I never felt that before. And now we’re practically strangers.

It turns out that thing in in my knee was a really rare type of tumor,"Man this year has been a strange one. I graduated university in December. I then accepted a job across the country and moved to get closer to my girlfriend. Got one of the puppies my parents bred and flew it here in May. Next, my girlfriend moved in with me and we’ve been living together for a couple months now. It’s the first time I’ve lived with a SO.

Most recently I finally checked on the “fluid” I had in my right knee, probably from an injury sustained in high school soccer. The doctor said it was the size of two walnuts (side note but doctors have the weirdest length scales when it comes to tumors) MRI, XRAYs, specialists and finally an oncologist telling me that it would be best to take it out. I was lucky though. It was a big sucker, but just under the skin, thankfully outside of my knee, and was most likely benign.

Well come time for the surgery and it only lasted 10 min, but left a 6 inch incision. Very thorough and was surprised he left any for me, but it was all over with at least. Recovery wasn’t too bad. I had to push myself bending my knee in order to avoid any PT. It hurt, but it wasn’t so bad.

Finally, I go for my follow up almost 3 weeks later only to find out the pathology wasn’t done yet... weird but whatever. I then got a call 2 weeks after from a nurse saying that the doctor would be calling me later and that they had been discussing my diagnosis in a medical conference all morning.... erm what?

Turns out the tumor was one with less than 100 well documented cases, angiomatoid fibrous histiocytoma (needs a new name. Told them they could name it after me if they wanted to) it’s a low grade malignant tumor that is very very mild. He told me I should be all done with treatment, but scheduled a PET scan in December just to make sure it doesnt come back. Coolio

Being 'nice' and being 'kind' are two totally different things,"I see the distinction between the two as a matter of intention ('nice') vs. action ('kind'). It is nice to ask someone if they want a glass of water, but it is kind to go and get them a glass of water. And I think a lot of nice people are not very kind, and a lot of kind people are not all that nice. 

I was thinking about this watching 'The Last Dance' where the Bulls players talk about how Michael Jordan was a bully and went very hard on them during practice, but at the end of the day they felt grateful to him for bettering themselves. While he was not being nice, I do think he was being kind to everyone by expecting the best and helping them to achieve that with his actions.

I stopped walking to school and took the bus instead. I stopped cycling. I stopped everything. And now as a college student I find it hard to take time out of my day and exercise.

But today was different, I challenged myself that I would take a walk and see how it goes. In the first 10 minutes I started getting breathless, but towards the end it started to get a little bit easier. My body was burning like HELL and I was so red but it felt amazing.

I wish I can keep up with that because this reminded me of how good it felt to be active.",confusedvampy,10,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/CasualConversation/comments/in8zt2/i_took_a_50minute_walk_today_for_the_first_time/,back middle school used active used play basketball go swimming session used play street neighbour run hour used ride bike hour feel tired life wa active back know happened exactly stopped stopped walking school took bus instead stopped cycling stopped everything college student find hard take time day exercise today wa different challenged would take walk see go first 10 minute started getting breathless towards end started get little bit easier body wa burning like hell wa red felt amazing wish keep reminded good felt active,took 50 minute walk today first time since middle school feel amazing,confused vamp
I am bad with accepting random outcomes. Any advice is welcome,"I can accept results that has any kind of reasoning behind it just fine. For example, if I run into a tree because I was looking at a cat, I can accept that. If I do well in an exam because I prepared for it, I can accept that. 

What I can't accept are results that are random, especially negative ones. I know it sounds extremely selfish and self centered and it honestly is. For example, say I'm playing xcom, a notorious retro game known for its ability to make people yell colourful words. I make a decision with a stated 87% success chance. It fails. It's random, 87% is not 100%, I know that and yet it feels really really bad. It makes me angry. I immediately start victimizing myself.

Thing is, I know the opposite happens sometimes too. a 22% success chance, hey sometimes it works out. But those don't feel as rewarding as failing makes me angry.

How do I curb this tendency.

How to pull back from a sticky friendship,"I have a complicated relationship with a certain friend and I need more space. We have gone through more than a few times of no contact, but I never planned to start up again. We went to the same protest a few months back and I figured we could be plague pals.

Before we stopped talking the last time, we had been planning on opening a business together. She went ahead without me, which I don't have hurt feelings over. She asked me for some help editing her material and I agreed, but now she treats me more as a partner. She asks me about decisions, big and small, and refers to us as ""we"" even though I am not part of her business.

Today I woke up with a block of text about how she wrote mean comments on someone's facebook (only kind of warrented) and then blocks of text about the business.

The last time I tried to pull back, she told me the things I was complaining about were on me, and afterwards we didn't speak until the protest. I don't know how to pull back without her not understanding, not listening, or blowing up.",longalongass,0,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/CasualConversation/comments/inq6n8/how_to_pull_back_from_a_sticky_friendship/,complicated relationship certain friend need space gone time contact never planned start went protest month back figured could plague pal stopped talking last time planning opening business together went ahead without hurt feeling asked help editing material agreed treat partner asks decision big small refers u even though part business today woke block text wrote mean comment someone facebook kind warrented block text business last time tried pull back told thing wa complaining afterwards speak protest know pull back without understanding listening blowing,pull back sticky friendship,long along

I helped someone today... And yet at the end of the day i was the one left feeling blue.,"See what's going on is these 2 friends of mine, they were fighting for some reason or the other, (even they don't know what the reason was).
 Ps: one is friend. One told me not to talk to her ever again. But i wanted to do this for them. Cuz they are really tight and i couldn't see them like that...

Anyway continuing with the incident at hand. A 3rd person had a birthday today and i, well, let's just say arranged the birthday to be celebrated somewhere the two fighting could talk... Which they did and i was so happy at the end when people who weren't even talking to each other ended up like the old days. And even said goodbye 😬. Which is progress trust me...

And even then, somehow I don't know why I'm feeling blue when i should be proud and be happy for them...

Is this normal or am i just broken?

Also for refference- someone just called me insensitive a couple of days ago... So any thoughts???

I forgave myself last night,"I'm someone who doesn't have many friends so the feelings of loneliness hits hard, and it didn't help that I hated my life. Since the start of the year I've been having such dark thoughts in my head.  Everyday I would see other people my age enjoying life, doing things that I always wanted. I would wonder how my life would be like if I took things more seriously when I was younger. I wasted so many opportunities to better myself over the years. So much regret and resentment. There was nothing about me that I loved. 

Last night I was having one of those episodes of comparing my life to others. I initially starting blaming myself like I usually do but for some reason I started to I asked myself why I so hard on myself. My parents wouldn't want me to be like this. They raised me to be kind and loving but the only person that I didn't give those feelings to was me. And for the first time in my life I was kind and forgave myself. I sat at my desk and cried my eyes out but I wasn't sad. There were no feelings of hate anymore. I probably looked like a maniac because I was actually smiling, eventually laughing out loud realizing that forgiveness, something that I had no problem handing out to other people, was something I needed this entire time. I felt motivated to start living but for real this time, to learn new skills and to find something that I'm passionate about. I was happy. 

Today is my first day at my first job so I'm hoping that this feeling of happiness continues for awhile.

What's happening,"So many post about height going on here, and it just made me think that we as humans have created such a negative impact on each other regarding our physical attributes. 

I am 5'6 (average according to most standards) and sadly a little on the porky side but hey I suppose if it bothered me that much I would change it. 

Dating is practically a dead zone in my life most of my friends are abroad so my circle of influence is very limited and I would go so far as to say I am a loner. 

Socially I am outgoing and can relate or speak to anyone. I have very little judgement of people.  We all are trying to survive I guess. 

What really gets to me though is why have we become so judgemental? 

Why do we learn towards more negative environments and why do so many more people, every day feel so horribly alone? 

I read the tinder and dating over subs reddits and it really makes me wonder how 8 million people can be so connected but so disconnected at the same time. 

Are we losing touch with our own selves? Have we managed to skip over the ability to create connections? 

What could we do to change things?

I haven't been to the dentist in 7 years. I finally got the gumption up to go back to my childhood dentist and I'm pleased to say that I'm still cavity-free at 31!,"It's a bit of lie...I actually went to the dentist 6 months ago, but he was so awful that it hardly counted as a dental visit. It did, however, finally give me the nerve to go see a real dentist.

First, he didn't even floss all my teeth and the brushing they did equated to what I could do at home.

**Second, at the end of the visit he freaking dipped his fingers in vaseline and rubbed them all over my mouth. WTF!!**

So, my parents convinced my childhood dentist (who isn't taking patients) to take my husband and me as his patients. He's a really good dentist, but he's been a little tough on me when I was visiting more regularly (around 2008) because I wasn't as regular with flossing as I should be. He (lightly) sprayed me in the face with the water once because he was convinced I should have a cavity, eek! haha.

I was terrified of going to see him last week. I told him I am genuinely more worried about disappointing him than I am about disappointing my own parents, lol. He said he was just mad that I've only gone to the dentist once in since 2013.

But, I got it over with and he said my teeth looked great but that I need to floss more regularly (of course). I have no idea how I've managed to not have any cavities in my life...I'm just lucky I guess!",BushyEyes,6,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/CasualConversation/comments/incws7/i_havent_been_to_the_dentist_in_7_years_i_finally/,bit lie actually went dentist 6 month ago wa awful hardly counted dental visit however finally give nerve go see real dentist first even floss teeth brushing equated could home second end visit freaking dipped finger vaseline rubbed mouth wtf parent convinced childhood dentist taking patient take husband patient really good dentist little tough wa visiting regularly around 2008 regular flossing lightly sprayed face water wa convinced cavity eek haha wa terrified going see last week told genuinely worried disappointing disappointing parent lol said wa mad gone dentist since 2013 got said teeth looked great need floss regularly course idea managed cavity life lucky guess,dentist 7 year finally got gumption go back childhood dentist pleased say still cavity free 31,bushy eye

"I became a driver trainer for a trucking company and hit 5 years sober, and yet nobody seems to care.","Like the title says, hit 5 years sober back on August 23rd, and became a trainer at the beginning of August for my company. My wife said that I did a god job at becoming a trainer, but doesn’t seem interested in the next step in my career. 

Since becoming a trucker, I’ve lost contact with the few friends I did have, and now I just drive and go home. Becoming a trainer in my company is kind of a big deal as they don’t let anybody become one. Have to get a few recommendations beforehand. 

As far as 5 years sober, does it really matter if nobody cares if I’m a drunk or not anymore? It does to me, and it’s one of the very few things I’m proud of in my life.

"If the choice were up to you, would you choose for humanity to cease every non-essential activity/industry in the name of environmental conservation?","This is a thought experiment inspired by the fact that the international quarantine efforts have also had the effect of reducing our environmental impact at least for as long as the lockdown lasts.

By ""essential"" I mean activities or things that humans need to survive and function on a basic level, so healthcare, basic nutritionally sufficient food, water, education, things like that. Those would be the only things you're allowed to do or have in this situation. So no movies or TV shows, gaming, toys, luxury items or ""status symbols"", decorations, Reddit, etc. Basically no more entertainment or luxury. Things that already exist can still be used, but not if they require constant energy input (like non-essential websites or gaming consoles), and when they break, they much be disposed of in the least environmentally impactful way possible, but the main point is that we would no longer spend resources on making any more of them. Humanity would basically become as frugal as possible. This wouldn't be returning to when humanity had no technology (that would actually increase our environmental impact and also cause needless suffering), but simply using and developing technology only in ways that aid our survival, nothing else.

By eliminating the things we don't absolutely need, our environmental footprint would go way down, which would obviously be beneficial for the Earth and reduce the probability that humanity destroys itself by destroying the world we live in. Life would be dull in this scenario, and we'd basically be saying good bye to the modern entertainment saturated lifestyle enjoyed by many people, possibly forever. But in exchange we'd be giving us as a species the best shot at not going extinct from our own actions by reducing our actions to only those we can't live without. It would also have the secondary effect of allowing us to focus our resources on things we actually need.

If hypothetically you could, would you choose to live in a world like this? What do you think of it?

Greetings again! I hope you all had a good day!,"Hello there! It me again! The stranger who failed to stay asleep and woke up with a mouth sore! I hate to be that person but I'm once again failing to sleep. It's 1 am and I obviously can't tell myself that the pull chain on my ceiling fan is just reacting to physics and that things can go bump in the night with 4 pets.... 🤦‍♀️

I sleep with a hamster in my room, they are nocturnal creatures so of corse she likes to horde and run on her wheel at night. The pull chain is a long string which can obviously be manipulated by the fan's movement. I know these things yet my instincts yell, ""Nope! Keep the lamp on!""

And for an update on the sore, I tried applying Alum but found that the sore was big enough to cause my teeth to irritate it enough. I found that it had started bleeding (sore for the gore...). My mom found some medication to help with the pain and find the best way to get it to heal. Go mom! I now have a slightly swollen lip and I have no more Dr. Pepper for tomorrow... I'll have to ask my brother for a coffee if I'm actually going to stay up like a coward, is it okay to sleep with the covers over my face?

Weird dreams,"Alright, So I keep having these dreams of where I go into different timelines or places in the world. Example: Grand Canyon, a jungle, medieval times, and so in these dreams different scenarios happen. It's like a story almost plot twists, non-fiction. Once you die you restart a new life in a new place.. whenever you do die it tells you where you're going to go. I died 2 times in my dream by a rushing huge river. They're so scary they make me cry, but yet so addicting?? I can't explain the fear. I think it's with my fascination of past lives, traveling the world n' stuff. I don't know why I have these dreams they make me tear up, because I die in them.. and restart a new life. Am I afraid of dying or the thought of having a past life? I like my friends, family, my appearance. I like me. I don't want me to end. And I wonder where we go when we die. Afterlife? A new life? Do we just... not exist anymore? It's hard for me to think what do we do without a brain.. I consider a new life other than the Afterlife or Black screen, We become a doll eh.. conspiracies. Anyways, Does anyone know anything about these weird dreams? Has it ever happened to anyone else? Or am I just overreacting, and overthinking it.. );

It is so adorable to see famous people being loyal to their partners,"Sometimes it feels like life is beyond complicated for no reason and it feels like I might be missing out on things, but then you see even richest and most successful people live family life and despite money and being able to spend it on other things, they decided to have family and love in their life.

A change I’ve noticed lately is that I find my actually considering getting into a relationship... which is weird since I’ve said no to people since I don’t date. And it’s really confusing. I find myself thinking of adventures we’d have but then snap back and tell myself I still have tons to study and improve and that I should just forget it.

I'm 28. How are you doing 1991-92 babies?,"Hello. I'm a 28 year old guy and thought I would check in with others my age. I don't talk with people my age anymore as they're either early twenties or thirties and over. How is life for you?  


I graduated with a (useless) liberal arts degree and am currently working in retail until I save enough money to move to Japan to teach English (I've done this work before, just not in Japan. As for why I'm not teaching now, it's complicated). I still don't have real friends that I can call up and hang out with, and I've only had a few romantic relationships (more like ""flings""). I'm afraid of getting older because I want to actually experience my twenties, make friends with people in their twenties, date people in their twenties, be young and go to college parties instead of having nerd parties living with parents. But unfortunately age 24-28 has been marked by multiple setbacks and mental illness that I'm still dealing with. Quarantine has been hard for me because I want to finally ""get out there"" and ""leave my comfort zone"" as I've been kind of a hermit my whole life, and then this happens. But I've been trying to keep busy with video games, studying Japanese, playing my bass, fantasizing about playing guitar again, and just going to work though I don't quite like it.

"Reddit randomly revealed my face, without me wanting to","Alright, let's go about two years back in time to explain this. I had been texting a person on reddit for quite a long time, and they started to ask me to show a pic of myself. I had a freshly created, blank Reddit account, so I just updated my profile picture with an image of myself, I let her see it, and then I removed it (because I wanted my account to be anonymous). I thought that would have been it, to be honest.

My profile picture has remained blank ever since, I don't know why, but I never bothered to add one haha

Skipping forward to today, I wrote a comment on a post of one of my reddit friends. He then messaged me, saying there was something strange: ""I got a notification with an image of someone on it, is that you?"" He sends me the screenshot, and YES, in the notification he got from my comment, you could see that image in my profile icon, without me ever adding it! I was quite shocked, I usually very rarely send pics of myself to people I meet online, and Reddit just did it without me wanting to! This is so creepy, I'm assuming the image has always been on the servers, and there was some kind of bug?



Also, just to make it clear, it wasn't that big of a deal. I would have eventually revealed my face too (all my other reddit friends did), and in the end, you know, it's just a face. But this really made me think: what we post on the internet, is truly forever, it won't disappear! Even if we delete it, it'll still be on some server somewhere!

Moral of the story: REALLY pay attention to what you post online, because it's nearly impossible to completely get rid of it, once you do.

I let someone hug me for the first time today in 8 years and it felt so good I cried.,"Long story short, I was bullied by almost the entirety of my 7th grade class (there were 9 of us and 5 of them bullied me). Because of some events that happened over the months I refused to let my parents, family, and friends hug me. I’d slink away or do what my friends dubbed a “penguin hug” and only put my chin on their shoulders. 

Today I visited one of my best and only friends from high school, and she is very respectful of my boundaries when it comes to hugs and whatnot. Before I left, she wanted to say goodbye and started a hug but retracted it, but I said “you know what? Go for it.” And she hugged me, I hugged her, for a good minute. I was so happy. I actually hugged someone. And I let her hug me. I cried. Hugs feel so good. I can’t wait to give my parents a hug later tonight.

Obligatory Redditor’s Edit: I woke up this morning to so many people touched and moved about my story. I read every one of your comments, and your stories/comments were all so sweet and kind.

An antisocial freak who couldn't read or write got into the top school,"I was never a studious child. No matter how hard I tried I just couldn't get my grades up, it was like that ever since I started school. I was even asked to repeat a grade when I was 5, because I couldn't read or write properly when most of the class could. Math was a pain and still is lol. My childhood had been taken away so I could focus more on studying and being a better student. I yearned for what other kids had. They had the grades, they had extra curricular activities and they were having fun. They *liked* school. I couldn't understand how they did all that at once. My teachers would yell at me and I was never chosen for anything. This  resulted in terrible social anxiety, which affected my confidence alot. I couldn't even order food without nearly bursting into tears. So I became known as the quiet kid who wasn't even good at her studies.

I always wondered, just what is wrong with me? I try so hard but nothing ever works. I've done everything, extra classes, online tutors, and staying up all night. I couldn't understand it, just why was I never successful? 

By the time 7th grade rolled around, all my classmates left the school so they could go to better schools with bigger names. They all wanted to attend the best school in the country, let's call it ""The It School"". Now, this school was incredibly hard to get into. Even class toppers who applied didn't get in. Thousands of admissions yet only 80 or less got in.  Everyone always wondered, what is it that this school looks for in a student? What is the perfect student for them? That school created a whole market because tutors were there specifically to help kids get in, and most didn't. It was a rat race for that school. 

As I said before, most of the applications are rejected, so everyone applies to different schools with big names but not as big as The It School. My classmates left me, and in was the only one there at my old school which was very small. I still sucked at studying but by 7th grade, my grades were average. Bs and Cs filled my report card with the occasional A. 

Now, 8th grade was a nightmare, I was bullied relentlessly for things I didn't do and rumours were spread about me. This affected my grades terribly and i failed in several subjects including math. I was broken that year. Shattered. 

However, after bullying was over, a spark was lit inside of me. A spark of determination. The next year, I topped each subject, 100 marks in every paper. I turned my life around and won speech competition after speech competition. My anxiety left me entirely. 

Now, the examinations for The It School rolled around, but were postponed sheveral times due to the virus. This year, for the first time, the school changed its criteria. They had always just looked at the entry test results. There was no test this time. It was based purely on luck and a record. I'm telling you, this was the time everyone wished they had done their assignments!

Anyway, just like any other year, 2000+ people submitted their records and just prayed they'd get in. And when the admissions list was put up, most of the city's kids cried. The reason? There were only 20 names on that list. 

Including mine. 


As soon as the list was up, relatives I didn't even know congratulated me. My old classmates who I hadn't spoken to in years had reached out to me and started talking about how I was 'so lucky!!' to have gotten in. Gifts were sent to my house, and boy did I feast on all the cakes sent to me. My dad's co-workers were calling him one after the other to congratulate him on this. Word spread like wildfire.

To be honest, all that attention felt fantastic. After being the stupid kid for nearly all my life, it feels amazing to be showered with praise. To all the kids who struggled just like me: you can do it. We all can do it. Your potential is like a hidden goldmine, untapped. It isn't exactly about working hard, it is about working smart. Find the teaching method that suits YOU. Like Einstein once said, ""Everybody is a genius, but if you judge a fish on it's ability to climb a tree, it will live it's whole life believing that it's stupid. 

I wish everyone the best of luck, and if you've read it this far, thanks for listening to my story. Now I'm just praying I get into med school :D

Compliments Growing Up,"I’m (33F) not really sure how to bring this up without sounding conceited but I’ve always wondered if my experience was common or unique. My entire life I’ve had random people tell me I’m beautiful. Growing up I had extremely poor self-esteem and never liked the way I looked. I figured it was just something adults said about kids. I was also in an extreme minority where I grew up so I thought maybe people just thought I looked “exotic”. 

As I’ve grown older my self-esteem has improved somewhat but I’m still more self-conscious than most and suffer from social anxiety.

"Of all the career risks I’ve taken, running a band has been the most helpful and healthiest so far.","I’m young to some but 30 has shed some light on this opportunity I reluctantly funded in my early 20’s (honestly almost forgot about it). This 3 piece ‘rock’ band had zero people listening to what I would call a “tried and true” rendition of popular soft rock mixed with a touch of funk influence, (I didn’t care if they didn’t make it, this was my half-ass attempt to manage a band. I’ve always wanted to) but I liked what I heard and I thought it was worth the couple bills to see what they could do.
Let’s call it 5 yrs ago (no record before signing up with them), I helped fund their recordings and merchandise. That was the agreement. All they wanted me there for, right?

WRONG!

I’ll never forget the first jam they had with me present. I ended up sweaty and high off adrenaline from ‘jammin’ on drums with them. Loved the rush and can’t express enough about how positive their connection felt while playing with these established musicians.
Let it be known that my sole goal was to work with them so’s to shove me up there so I can talk with  other, more established artists (hopefully manage). I really don’t have a clue what it takes to make quality music. 

Well tell you what, I can. This 3 piece helped me better understand what I want from music and overall companionship. My favourite experience as an ‘important part’ to the writing process was the in-depth, co-operative feedback we all had for ideas. Like.. let me tell you, when I had a thought to share about a song or idea for whatever (video, promo, post), it was eaten up like hyenas fighting over (what I thought was) a meatless carcass... The fun poked at it, the ‘cringey’ relatable experiences shared and jokes about how true it felt to identify as an unsuccessful part of a band was refreshing as it was confusing. (Didn’t know they were so hard on themselves, learned a lot about them)

I joined this business operating as a ‘casual director/funder’ in a sense, so I could climb my way to a managing position for an upcoming, bigger, better band.

Proud is how I felt during and after the band’s success.

I went for a walk today for the first time in months and it felt so good,"I’ve been cooped up in my apartment for the last 6 months with minimal social interaction. I’m not used to that and I have to say it’s been a pretty difficult time for me. At first I was eating healthy and getting some exercise, but somewhere along the line I just gave up. 

Over the last few months I’ve just been in my apartment. I work, I stream shows, I play video games, and my mental health has been deteriorating. 

Today, however, I just said screw it and got myself to go for a walk. Almost right off the bat it felt so good, and afterwards I feel so relaxed and accomplished. Best I’ve felt in months. I just wanted to share that.

I overheard a mother disciplining her sons today.,"I sat on a bench in my town when a mother with her two young sons came walking by. Across the street there was a fat man, walking and minding his business. 

The older one of the boys said to his brother 'Hey, look' and pointed his finger at the man. The mother immediately told him to put his finger down and to cut it out. She said that she didn't raise him like this and that every person is different and to not do that again. 

I, an almost fat person myself, smiled at her, she nodded her head at me and I just wanted to tell her that she was a good mother, but she already went her way.

It made me so happy that he wanted me to know and I’ve been smiling the rest of my walk.

"I love surfing, but live 1000 miles away from the nearst ocean.","I was in Hawaii a few years ago and I tried surfing for the first time. I'm not sure what the typical beginner experience is, but these waves weren't too big at all. Big enough to surf, but not so big that a beginner like me wouldn't be able to ride them. It was probably one of the most fun things I've ever done. Every ocean I've been even remotely close to since then, I've always attempted to go surfing (to varying degrees of success) because it is so damn fun.

The problem with all of this is that I'm from the midwest, where the waves are so big that they had to build the cities 1000 miles from the nearest coastline, surfing isn't something I can do regularly out here. I go surfing once or twice a year. I've been making it a point to save some money and make it out to an ocean at least once a year.

This seems like a problem that will hopefully go away soon, as life is currently presenting me with an opportunity to jump ship out here and move to California (relatively) soon.

Whenever I meet someone from the coast that doesn't surf, it annoys me a little bit. Like these people have lived their whole lives near a perfectly surfable ocean and yet they have not deemed those perfectly good waves worthy of catching. &gt;:( I know it's not for everyone but god damn everyone should at least try it!",AXxi0S,0,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/CasualConversation/comments/ingrx4/i_love_surfing_but_live_1000_miles_away_from_the/,wa hawaii year ago tried surfing first time sure typical beginner experience wave big big enough surf big beginner like able ride wa probably one fun thing ever done every ocean even remotely close since always attempted go surfing varying degree success damn fun problem midwest wave big build city 1000 mile nearest coastline surfing something regularly go surfing twice year making point save money make ocean least year seems like problem hopefully go away soon life currently presenting opportunity jump ship move california relatively soon whenever meet someone coast surf annoys little bit like people lived whole life near perfectly surfable ocean yet deemed perfectly good wave worthy catching gt know everyone god damn everyone least try,love surfing live 1000 mile away nearst ocean,xxi 0

Also how do toys die? What if they’re broken into a bunch of little pieces? Will they live on as little bits of material and suffer?

Would being vaporized by a massive flaming gas giant finally end them? Could they reach peace?

But i came to talk about how Reddit impacted my life and how i started to realise that media like always portrayed reddit badly just like they did 4chan even though that's not at all true. Reddit is what you make it. I used to be on questionable subs and when i started to distance myself from these. I started to realise how wholesome and nice Reddit can be. Of course there's still people who farm Karma or just act stupid and mean but for the most of it i've seen great posts about life changing advices or stories that made me grow up and mature a bit slowly or just watch memes wich is also great. But to think that this is one of the only places where over sexualised teenagers or models arent the main thing and it still gets talked down by media is annoying and honestly dissapointing. Maybe im the only who thinks this but i'd be glad to hear what other people think about what i had to say.

Crazy how life just passes by,"Hi, I'm a single man, 27. Was drinking my hard worked Saturday beer and listened to a very nostalgic song for me. It made me remember the time I moved to another city to study on a public university (believe me, it is very hard to get on one of those in my country and it is very respectable to study on these unis here, something like the Ivy League there in america). I've finished the course but in the middle of it I realized it was not my thing. Talked to my parents who invested time and money for me getting there, so they convinced me to finish it. Well, I finished and never had the opportunity nor the love to pursue a career in it (Civil Engineering, very very hard course, which only its conclusion was a pain in the ass). Came back to my city, after 6 years there. Went when I was 18-19, concluded with 24, going through a hard depression at the time and growing up in general. I've maturated a lot there.

So I graduated and came back to live with my mother. Went unemployed a long time, even with that beautiful public uni diploma. I was grown on that mindset, that only the diploma mattered. It destroyed me, but today I've went through it. Now I'm completing one year employed, yet living with my mother, but the situation is completely different. I plan to move out yet this year if things continue going the way they are.

So today I remembered those living alone times and came to the conclusion how things pass. It has been more than 2 years that i've graduated. The only thing that remains is my diploma and friends I made along the way. I did not retained much of knowledge about civil engineering. It was never my thing. My father, who pursued me to finish it, is really nice with me, but shows no signs of regret about the day I told him to visit me and talk about my dissatisfaction in general.  My family have too put all of that under the carpet. Seems like another life I've lived. I work in administration/accounting field, because of experience with numbers and excel in general, maybe one of few things my graduation gave me. 

So I caught my self thinking how things passed by. That time I was ashamed that so many people put expectations on me and I've failed to deliver. Now seems that even I've started to forget about, as things moved on. I've started a new course on technology/programming area, something that I discovered myself last year. I came to terms with my parents in general, after being unemployed for a time. I know i'm still a disappointment to some of my relatives and even my parents. But I've managed to get over it and have hope to make my on life and be able to help them soon enough. Even now, with a job that don't live up with their (and even mine) expectations, I'm able to give some help where I can.

Well, to finish off this vent out, I want to all you people get the following message: are you dissatisfied with your graduation/job field? Quit it then. Do not force something you know you don't like. I was young and a very manipulated person, specially by my parents. They've done wrong to me yes, but I have my part of the blame too. At least I learnt that I will never put my son in these type of situation. People have the right to live their on dreams, not the dreams of others, even if that 'others' are their parents or grandparents. That f*cked me up for a long time.

Ever wish you could forget someone?,"There was this girl that went to my school. And she was so damn pretty. Like, I had a crush on her four three years since 8th grade. We sometimes texted each other via Instagram, but we never went anywhere, and we never talked Irl.

She moved away over the summer, and I still follow her Instagram. I’m trying to hard to forget her. But I also don’t want to unfollow her, because I want to see how she turns out in the end.

I sometimes look at her stories, and she is still pretty as ever. I used to feel lust for her, but now I just feel sadness. Everything has slowly gone downhill for me, some of it caused by COVID and some not.

I often think about suicide, and how easy it would be to just end it. But I want to stay alive.

I used to think I had a chance with her. But with her being at a new school, I often feel jealous for everyone who gets to see her walk through he halls, watch her change her hair and clothes throughout the year, and for whatever lucky guy ends up with her.

I’m not looking for advice here. I know where to go for that.

In so far as I can tell now: the devs wanted to get on a list of terrible video game controlls. Congratulations Devs of that game you are now on that list. Tank style controll from the 90s that flip flop around. But also the plot is basically I'm a investigator. someone says something weird is in this house. And it has the worse electrical wiring, how else do we explain that despite what look like a million and one light bulbs, none of them are on? And I won't bring anything useful to defend myself, or bring a crap load of back up?.

Wouldn't you want be wearing a powered armor suit by now? And how come people don't  like her know when to show up? did someone on her team tell them? oO

I caught a scammer pretending to be my friend today,"So, for a while now I thought my friend, we'll call A, had two instagram accounts and just switched between them once in a while. But, the second account, As, was kinda suspicious since the first time it messaged me. It had awful grammar, compared to my friend who always had perfect grammar. Honestly, a month ago that was the only information I had to go off and I just assumed that it was my friend but writing lazier than usual.

Fast forward to today. I often ask my friends to look over assignments I do to see if they make sense and answer the questions asked. I messaged As asking for help and it said ok. About 5 hours later I had no response so I messaged A and As if they got it and A said no.

I showed the email I sent my work to and A said that she didn't have that email, only a similar one she hasn't used in years. Then we got suspicious and found that As was an impersonator. I asked A some questions like favorite color (pink), my favorite band (MCR), if she had a sister (no).

I asked As the same questions and she only got MCR right. As even tried saying that she had a half sister and wanted to go to colorado and learn Portuguese.

We reported the account and I have no idea who it is. It may be some old creep thinking I'm a girl and wanting to kidnap me. I don't know, but I feel proud. We reported the account and hopefully all works out. It was weird.

So yeah, that was crazy. I'm glad I caught the scammer. Thanks for reading!

Today I managed to motivate by favourite professor.,"Hello folks. I hope all of you are doing good.

It is the 5th of September today. Which, in our country, is celebrated as Teachers’ day. You will come across various students posting statuses, pictures, and videos dedicating to their respective teachers as all of our educational institutions are currently shut and nobody is able to personally visit their teachers to thank them. Even social media today is filled with similar posts and pictures.

I felt the same urge to thank somebody who I rate highly. He is such a gem of a person that I could go on and on talking about him for hours and I won't be tired. He has helped me immensely not only in the subject which he teaches but also in shaping the way that I think about stuff in my life.

Anyway, so I decided to send him a short message expressing what I thought about him and how well he has been doing his job of being an excellent teacher to me. What he did next was something that I wasn’t really expecting or even prepared for.

I helped a guy at the gym today and it felt great!,"I was at the gym today and doing leg day, minding my own business. During one of my routines I saw a boy about the age of 13/14 (in Sweden the age requirement in gyms is usually 13). He seemed quite new to the gym as he was all over the place trying all the different machines.

I watched him as he did leg press and instantly noticed that he was straightening his legs at the top of the motion. I went over to him, explained and showed him how to do the exercise properly.

He was really thankful that I showed him and it feels great knowing that I potentially prevented a nasty knee injury!",DankDanksson,3,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/CasualConversation/comments/in184p/i_helped_a_guy_at_the_gym_today_and_it_felt_great/,wa gym today leg day minding business one routine saw boy age 13 14 sweden age requirement gym usually 13 seemed quite new gym wa place trying different machine watched leg press instantly noticed wa straightening leg top motion went explained showed exercise properly wa really thankful showed feel great knowing potentially prevented nasty knee injury,helped guy gym today felt great,dank dan ksson
"I stood up for myself to my friends for the first time ever, and I just needed to tell someone","I'm a 26 year old woman and have been friends with the same group of people since we were in middle school. These girls have known me all my life. We used to be huge bullies in high school, just because we had bigger tits and we cursed like sailors. I've since reached out to most of the kids I bullied and apologized. I'm not saying this to prove anything, I should've apologized then - scratch that, I shouldn't have bullied them then. Some of these girls never grew out of that, though. They are still huge bullies. They call it being confident and sure of themselves, but if you have to be rude to get ahead - that's not confidence. That's weakness. 

Anyways, I've gone from being outgoing and loud and extroverted to a miserable introverted antisocial person. I keep to myself, I don't ever go out and especially since the pandemic I have stayed home as much as humanly possible to the detriment of my mental health. Just because I live with people over 60. My friends now want to celebrate one's engagement, and they have been hammering me about going to their party. I think it's irresponsible to go to a club that is underground with no windows with 10+ people, all in their mid 20's who I'm sure have not been following any sort of guidelines and have been travelling and partying and sleeping around the past few months because...""OMG YOLO FOMO""... 

I have been called a pussy. 

I have sent voice messages on our WhatApp group chat and they tell me they don't have the patience to listen to my annoying whiny excuses. 

One of them told me I didn't care about them and only care about looking smart. Uhm... WHAT?

I finally had enough and lost my shit today. I went off on them, even though they still told me I was overreacting and that they didn't mean anything by those and we're friends and friends joke around. 

Honestly, at some point, I became the punching bag of this group and I'm sick of it. 

I might be overreacting to this pandemic, I might be over-doing it, I might be a pussy, but I sure as hell am done with taking their bullshit. I really want to leave the group, but if I do it'll just seem like I'm being childish. I don't want to fight. I don't want to do anything, and I especially would like to stop thinking about their stupid responses. If you don't want to listen to your friend's voice message, you don't have to insult them - just politely ignore it or just say ""hey, I can't listen right now, do you mind typing or waiting till I can listen for a response?""",GwenCocoUgo,2,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/CasualConversation/comments/in9wgx/i_stood_up_for_myself_to_my_friends_for_the_first/,26 year old woman friend group people since middle school girl known life used huge bully high school bigger tit cursed like sailor since reached kid bullied apologized saying prove anything apologized scratch bullied girl never grew though still huge bully call confident sure rude get ahead confidence weakness anyways gone outgoing loud extroverted miserable introverted antisocial person keep ever go especially since pandemic stayed home much humanly possible detriment mental health live people 60 friend want celebrate one engagement hammering going party think irresponsible go club underground window 10 people mid 20 sure following sort guideline travelling partying sleeping around past month omg yolo fomo called pussy sent voice message whatapp group chat tell patience listen annoying whiny excuse one told care care looking smart uhm finally enough lost shit today went even though still told wa overreacting mean anything friend friend joke around honestly point became punching bag group sick might overreacting pandemic might might pussy sure hell done taking bullshit really want leave group seem like childish want fight want anything especially would like stop thinking stupid response want listen friend voice message insult politely ignore say hey listen right mind typing waiting till listen response,stood friend first time ever needed tell someone,gwen coco ugo
I got a lot of things done today and I feel really proud of myself.,"I (18F) woke up quite early today, but I got ready a bit later as I planned to go on a walk, because for the first time in a few days it's finally not raining where I live and that makes me a bit happy. I wasn't sure if I'd get anything else done today, but then I remembered that my little sister asked me to cook something with broccoli the other day. I don't actually cook regularly at all, I think the last time was a few months ago. I hate my own cooking and I know how to make 3 things maybe.

So I went to buy groceries, decided that I want to make some broccoli cream soup as my mum makes it sometimes and it seems quite easy, so I asked her about it and most of the process is just boiling broccoli in water.

When I came home, I put the broccoli to cook and I put some clothes to wash. Then I decided that I'd clean around the house.  This I never really do either, unless they ask me. I'm not very close to my family so I don't like cleaning up after them.

I took everything out of the fridge including its compartments, and started cleaning the inside of the fridge. Then I went and washed the parts that I took out, patted them dry and I put them back in.

I then checked what needed to be thrown away from the food items that I took out of the fridge and put the rest of them back in a nice and organised way. I haven't seen my fridge like that in a while. 

I then finished the broccoli soup, and I was actually surprised because my sisters both really liked it, even though they had to ask me to give them more salt twice.

I also washed some dishes, cleaned the dining table and some other things in the kitchen, put my laundry out to dry and folded some other clothes too. I then went to my room and cleaned a bit there too, made my bed etc.

I had been feeling down for the last few days and I don't think I ever had such a productive day while I was feeling this way.

I just had a near death experience and I need to talk ad get it out of my system,"well, it happened like 3-4 hours ago,

I was driving my car when I came across a road jam that I knew would not open for at least the next 30-45 minutes, so i decided to take a dirt track shortcut that I knew about and also knew was empty

I was going about 60-70 on the dirt track, which admittedly is too fast for that road and is my fault, I was halfway through the dirt track when a dog (trying to chase my car) jumped in front of it and I instinctively swerved the car to the right, where there is wild shrubbery and construction debris, before the car rammed or hit something though, I turned the wheel completely to the other side and and tried braking, but the road was extremely bumpy and right as I was about to brake, the car bumped and my foot shifted enough for me to miss the brake pedal ( not sure if it important, but I was driving a manual transmission car )

so the car didn't stop and started going the other side to the left where there was a pillar supporting a bridge and a river right next to it, My brain was already in super panic mode by this time and I could see the car was gonna ram into the pillar, on reflex or by sheer dumb luck, I don't know, I somehow managed to stop the car 2-3 meters before the pillar at which point my heart was beating so fast I could actually hear it beating normally

It really made me realize how fickle life can turn suddenly and boy am I glad to have come out safe and unscratched .

I'm 15 and I still have an imagination... is this okay?,"Not just some small imagination world but a large developed imagination universe filled up with history, sports, politics, tv shows and movies, video games, music, and basically anything else. I feel like for a 15 year old who's currently learning how to drive and is in 10th grade it is super immature to have something like this but I feel like I can't help it. Usually every day I'll either ride my bike or bounce a basketball by myself and escape into this place. I'll add details to this imagination like maybe one day I'll create a crazy president who was super controversial or an underdog sports team winning the championship. This place is my escape from the real world and helps me deal with stress and help me feel so relaxed. It all started when I was fourth grade, I thought it was just a fun little thing to do but quickly became a hobby. I think a comparison to it is like a kid playing with his toys, however the difference is I never grew out of it. I feel ashamed about my imagination but it nevers gets in the way of my school work or my other hobbies. I guess its similar to either people who meditate or do yoga to relieve stress. This is the first time I ever shared or talked about this, if anybody from my life ever found out about this I would be so embarrassed.

Entire student dorm to myself,"So I just began renting a student dorm, in a block there's different sections, and each section there's 5 dorms and a communal kitchen. Booking times for my accommodation were 7 to 8 am. I joined the Facebook group to find a flock of students discussing group chats for their dorms or block to connect with their roommates.

I'm quite excited to meet new people, which is why I bothered paying for private dorms in the first place rather than just living at home with my parents despite the fact that I'm barely that far away from my parent's house to begin with.

It's now currently 8:22 PM and nobody has shown up to my particular section and I'm the only dorm in use. I know it's not just incredibly shy people who haven't come out their room yet because a paper slip with information is lodged into the side of the doors and falls when you first open the door.

I have an entire kitchen to myself, I don't really know what's happening and I hope to fucking God I have roommates at some point, it feels really weird having an entire day to kill with nothing to do.

Before you suggest I go downstairs and mingle you need to really think about that concept yourself. Nobody just waltz over to a random group of people and joins in the conversation in the communal areas, the only real way you make friends properly is by establishing a group and then socialising. Once a group has already been established, you don't just add yourself to that group, it becomes weirdly hard and they'd most likely just ignore you.

What's frustrating, is that my ""group"" is currently missing. I have the entire floor to myself. Nobody is here. I shower with the door unlocked and sometimes take trips to the kitchen with music playing out loud or barefooted or whatever the fuck because I know nobody is going to come in.

I'm kind of lonely.

I despise Robby from Cobra Kai (Spoilers),"I don’t really know how to explain it, but the more the show tried to turn him into a good person, I just hated him even more. It’s his own fault his dad doesn’t like him, you see in the first episode he treated his dad like shit. And if he realized that he was the reason his dad doesn’t like him, than he wouldn’t look for a father figure in Daniel. And the point still stands that Robby only went to Daniel to piss off his dad. Miguel won the karate tournament fair and square, it’s perfectly honorable to use someone’s weakness to beat them. He went in with an injured shoulder, which was entirely his own fault. Yes, Miguel shouldn’t have punched him at that party, but at that point I didn’t like him so I felt no sympathy for his character. His relationship with Sam was a mistake at best, and I find it extremely frustrating that they tore down Miguel to shed this asshole in better light. If you argue that his dad was a deadbeat, then you have to realize that he doesn’t like his dad because he’s POOR. It was extremely shallow for him to see Daniel as a better person just because he has more money. Rant over.

I woke up from my most vivid sleep paralysis experience and I can't stop thinking about it.,"I just moved into an apartment near my campus where reviews were poor and very bizarre things have occurred (rent's cheap). It's a studio apartment but I managed to place a futon and full size bed in there comfortably. This morning was the start of my second weekend here. I remember waking up naturally around 6AM then turning on my back to rest my eyes for a bit (this position gives me sleep paralysis 11 times out of 10). I didn't mean to fall back asleep, but it happened anyways. 

I then heard a knocking at my front door. My eyes opened but I couldn't make much sense of my surroundings. Soon after I heard my door open then quickly shut. This is when my heart began to beat out of my chest - I could not manage to lift my head to see who just opened my door! I heard vivid footsteps walk to the side of my bed, then to the kitchen, around, and then onto the futon. Once this auditory hallucination was on the futon, it began rummaging and turning, as if it were trying to get comfortable. 

Mindful breathing slowly helped me wake up. As soon as I woke I could feel my back drenched in sweat as well as my heart continuing it's drumming. I quickly got up and looked over the futon - nothing. This is my first sleep paralysis where I've felt the presence of something else.

I just left my job... Now I have to figure out how to pay my 5 moths of debt xd,"Well... Before the quarantine I have a job in a restaurant.

Three days ago, my boss call me to work after 4 month without working at all, and during that time I could'nt pay my rent, but the owner of the house was kinda cool and he told me to pay when all the situation of the quarantine ends.

So... The firts day of job was ok.

The second was mess up because no one expect the amount of client that came to the restaurant, and it was stressful 'cause they were only three employees in the restaurant, two in the kitchen, me in the public. We would'be fine with two persons.

The third day (this one), they told me that other person would be with me, but doesn't came early.

Today, came like 8 tables: the kitchen was a mess. The tables kinda too. And the stress was to much, but I was trying to not be stressfull so the others can be relax at least to me.

The restaurant have two floors, and in some part, the kitchen and the second floor are connected (that place was the site of the guy who makes juices and lemonades and stuff), and I was there preparing four glass of water, and I ask to my partners to give a towel to dry on the glass of water. They ignore me, I ask again and ignore me again. Then, one of the cheft ask me about something that was in that part where I was, and I pass the thing to him, and ask him again about a towel. He call the other guy in the kitchen to pass me napkins, and the guy throw me a pack of napskin in the face.

In that point I was mad and stressed about the whole disorganization of the restaurant that it's fault of the bosses for being lazy in many ways.

So, in that point I just tell the guy that throw the pack in the face that what's his f-- problem, and he told me that he's stress and doing stuff and bla... bla...

In that point, I just take of my uniform and left the job with the 8 tables awaiting being served.

It doesn't felt pleassure. I just felt anger, and I felt like wanna hit something or someone. 

But now I'm calm... And I'm not happy, but I'm glad to have left that place before I kill someone.

Now... I have to find another job xd

Meaby I'll be mess up for my own fault. But I'll be ok in the future.

I miss performing at Renfest.,"I work at a gas station, and on weekends I usually have a mandolin or a guitar with me to pass the slow parts of the day. 

My boss brought his son (around age 5) to work. Our phone lines went down Thursday during a storm, and my boss was here to work on that. So, his son was listening to me “practice” old Renfest tunes while his dad was foxing the phones. 

It drove home to me how much I miss little kids listening to music. Especially when mom and I performed at Renfest, how much little kids enjoyed our music. The parents would allow the kids to listen for a minute, then drag them away. The kids wanted to stay and listen, but the parents were always in a hurry to get on with 16th century shopping malls.

"I’ve (30sF) been down about COVID WFH, but then I realized all the personal benefits I’ve had.","On mobile. I’ve been home for 6+ months. I’m normally a very social person and enjoyed my work and personal life. I’ve been really itching to go back to work but there’s no end in sight so far. Sometimes I get real down thinking about much I miss my old life and friends. But then I started thinking about what good things the COVID pandemic has done for me. My skin wasn’t in the best of shape. I stopped wearing make up and started a skincare routine that has changed my skin drastically. I stopped using heat on my hair and have been keeping it in wet braids overnight, thus beautiful beach wavy hair. It’s grown so long too, which is what I’ve always wanted.  I’ve spent more time outdoors so my skin has a nice color to it (using spf of course.) I started working out and longer walks with my dogs almost every day. I have a beautiful collection of indoor plants that is a now newish hobby to occupy my time; it’s thriving and I never knew I had this interest. Overall I guess my point is, I’m feeling so good about myself lately! I am feeling more natural beauty instead of the processed business woman I was before. It’s just really refreshing. The COVID has definitely caused me some anxiety I have never had before, and I finally reach out for professional help, so that I could feel normal again and just..go out (still working on that though.)

Apparently I look considerable older than I am.,"This just happened and I needed to vent. For context, I am 24 and my Brother-in-law is 27. 

During lockdown, my BiL has done a lot of DIY, he's completely revamped his bedroom, and this meant there was a lot of waste. 

I have a big car, so I offered to load it up and drive him and the stuff to the local recycling centre, so we booked a slot for this morning, filled up the car, and headed off to dispose of all his crap. 

Now the rules for the recycling centre are that only one person can unload stuff, due to Covid, so I stayed in the car to start off with while my BiL unloaded. The employee who was helping us then said that I could come out and help, as there was a lot of stuff, so I dutifully popped on my mask and started to unload the car. 

At which point the employee looked at us and said ""aww it's nice to see a mother taking her son out"". 

Now, I am 3 years younger than my brother in law. So we just stared at him for a second to process what he'd just said before o awkwardly stuttered out that he's my brother in law, not my son, and the employee just laughed and carried on. 

I'm still a little shocked/mad, I mean, there's a reason you shouldn't assume people's relationships.

Just sharing my awesome first day!!,"Yesterday was my first day as an English teacher at a secondary school. I have experience with teaching secondary school kids, but that was with a mentor at another school (so there was always someone helping me). This new class at my school was solely for refugees or children that just entered the country and needed to learn English. 

I was so nervous about my lessons that I couldn't pee, was sweating and moved too much. By the time the lesson ended, I said: the bell will ring in less than a minute, is there anything you want to ask or tell me? And then this really quiet girl responded:' Miss, you're gorgeous.'
Of course I was caught off guard and I don't really reply well to compliments. I was so happy though! Then the students left and another person said:' you're my favorite teacher.'

And that my fellow redditors.... MADE MY DAY!! 😭❤️

Today I realized that the connection between my favorite movies might be the soundtrack composers,"I always had a hard time finding movies I would end up liking and it always seemed so random. Today I was streaming the soundtracks of my favorite or memorable films and I was surprised how many of the soundtracks have the same composer. Some of these composers are also known to work together. 

I do have favorite directors but I always found it strange that I could love a movie directed by one and dislike the rest of his filmography. Turns out I should pick my movies based on the composers.

It seems that composers tend to choose movies that let their music have more impact. And of course the music is better if they feel they are working on something special.

I don't consider it meditation (though I've never meditated before so maybe it is) but how I get rid of it requires a bit of imagination.

It's not always a cure for it either. I just sort of move the pain.

Basically when it's a sharp stabbing pain I close my eyes and focus on where it's located then imagine the pain being spread out. The idea of that is pretty much dilution. The more you spread the concentrated pain the less painful it becomes.

I usually imagine it spreading like a force field in movies or games that gradually wraps around something (in this case, my brain) and the sharp pain dulls.

I'm sometimes left with a dull but manageable headache that doesn't make me want to throw up whatever medicine I try to take or it goes away completely.

It doesn't work very well with migraines though. I can make the pain dissipate a little but it usually comes back unless I'm laser focused all the time.

This might not work for people who actually read this long ass post but it helps me out a lot.

NOTE: It requires ALL your focus over sometimes a long period of time. If you feel it working do *not* stop until you're sure it's at a level you can deal with. If you feel the pain starting to condense back where it came from then go back to focusing before it does.",NightStar79,2,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/CasualConversation/comments/imzq1m/so_i_can_usually_control_my_headaches_and_force/,thought might useful someone wa also thinking posting medical related sub seem take kindly alternative medicine sort consider meditation though never meditated maybe get rid requires bit imagination always cure either sort move pain basically sharp stabbing pain close eye focus located imagine pain spread idea pretty much dilution spread concentrated pain le painful becomes usually imagine spreading like force field movie game gradually wrap around something case brain sharp pain dulls sometimes left dull manageable headache make want throw whatever medicine try take go away completely work well migraine though make pain dissipate little usually come back unless laser focused time might work people actually read long post help lot note requires focus sometimes long period time feel working stop sure level deal feel pain starting condense back came go back focusing doe,usually control headache force go away least minimize pain unless migraine,night star 79
I can't seem to overcome my fear of cockroaches,"I can only kill cockroaches using bug spray, but without that, I'm powerless. I NEVER in my whole life killed them by using slippers, shoes, swat them by a broom etc. I usually tell my dad or someone beside me to kill it. Call me scared cat, I'll agree with you.

Yesterday night, I was coming back home. While opening the door to insert a key, a HUGE cockroach was flying towards my foot. Surprised and scared, I jumped, accidentally punched my left knee together with a key and run for my life. My brother saw the whole, opened the door and called my dad. I was crying because of the bruise and it still hurts today.

I left my toxic friend group today and am working on respecting myself more!,"I'm 23M and have never had very high self esteem or much respect for myself. Lately my hygiene and my physical health have slipped a lot. My friend group was toxic and while I don't blame them for my own problems, they didn't help with my mental state. It was hard to build up the courage to stop talking with them because they have been the only people I've seen regularly for a long time, especially since lockdown happened. But today I decided to block all of them and I left and deleted our group chat that I've been in for a long time.

I have my therapist to thank for helping me find the strength to do that. I think it's a big step toward getting my life back on track. For some reason since I left the group chat I've felt a drive to start working out again as well as to keep myself clean. It's like I feel like I'm starting a new chapter in my life, a better one.

"As an F1 fan, I'm glad to see new and returning circuits added to the calendar.","F1 has been a little... weird this season. The pandemic caused many races to either be postponed or simply cancelled altogether, including the new Vietnam Grand Prix and the returning Dutch Grand Prix. The FIA did a great job of rescheduling some races, and eventually put together a solid calendar, which includes some new and returning tracks for this season. 

The new tracks are Mugello (Italy), Portimao (Portugal) and Bahrain Outer (Bahrain). Returning tracks are Imola (Italy), Nurburgring (Germany) and Istanbul Park (Turkey). I am very excited to see  lot of these tracks on the calendar, especially Istanbul Park and Portimao since I really like both these tracks. Bahrain Outer is going to be insane as well, as lap times in qualifying are expected to be as low as 55 seconds.

I just had my first marching band show and it was absolutely awful. Yay!,"It was God awful. We missed notes, missed steps, ran onto each other and were out of time. It was a literal train wreck. But this is good. 2 months ago, if you gave me a bass drum and asked me to play it, 2 things would have happened- 1) I would have put it on and buckled at the knees. Those things are heavy, especially if you weigh under 100 pounds and have arms that are thinner than your drumsticks. 2) I would have bombed (in a bad way) the music. My form would be wrong, and the music would sound truly awful. I also learned how to march (aka fancy walking), something that's not super easy when your drum blocks half of your field of vision. We had half the practice time we usually have because of Covid, and one person described our show as ""the worst show in the history of our school."" But this is all good. Why? Because I was able to go from not knowing how to play or march to marching and playing in a show in front of a hundred or so people, and that's progress. And as that one almond milk commercial says, progress is perfection.

Sorry if that was really long and ended up sounding more like a motivational speech than a casual conversation, but I wanted to share it because it made me happy.

pet peeve about texting,"i'm a guy

then in real life, when I see him again, he acts as if nothing happened

but I feel like there should be some sort of continuity between real life and texting, because both are forms of communication, regardlessit seems like mixed signals...but also it's a pet peeve of mine, i feel that if people never respond via text,they couldn't care lessam I going along with the wrong train of thought?

also, if someone takes 5 hours to respond to me, I should take 5 hours to respond back to them , right? cuz i thought friendships were give and take.

"To the stranger that knocked on my door to warn my about my neighbor garage on fire. Thank you, you did make the difference to avoid a horrible disaster.","3 days ago I was about to sleep and my next door neighbor is a garage where they make some welding.

So I went to the door with caution and a guy tell me: Hey the next door garage is on fire! So I just grabbed some clothes and get out of the house. The stranger told me he already called 911 and he left. So I alert the other neighbors and they came out of their house just to be safe, police, firefighters arrived and turn off the fire. Good thing no one was hurt and it was only my neighbor garage that was damaged and not so bad. But for a moment I really thought that if the fire gets to my house it could have gotten really bad.

Im 100% convinced Apps like Facebook and Reddit are ALWAYS listening to our conversations.,"And they are doing a poor job of hiding it if they are still denying it. Ever so often I will be talking with my mom irl or my friends through discord. Sometimes we will just generally bring up topics of stuff and then all of a sudden an Ad will be for that thing. The first time it feels like a coincidence but it has happened many times. And the worst part is when this happens its from vocal conversations. If I look up cat food and get ADs for cat food I'm not surprised or anything. But sometimes I'm just talking with my family in the living room face to face and then BAM Ad for something specific we talked about. Usually on Facebook which I almost never use, so when it happens on there I notice.

Is this even legal? Like listening to 100% of our conversations in order to run custom ads? Another fantastic example is of Reddit. Recently I've been noticing that I've been seeing a subreddit called r/chloe on the ""popular feed"" or whatever its called here. It's some anime girl or something. I don't like anime so I paid it no mind. However I just realized why its always showing up. We recently got a new dog named Chloe...

I finally told my parents what I want to do,"For about a year now I've been battling whether to tell my parents that I want to move in with my boyfriend of 2 years. It's something that I really wanted but also it is totally against their values. I've always thought very highly of their opinion and didn't want to just up and move out of the house without telling them. I really wanted their blessing.

Well, I just told them a few days ago and it pretty much turned out just like I thought they would. They thought it was a huge mistake and basically convinced me to stay home. However... even though I didn't get the outcome I wanted I'm still extremely proud of myself for standing up for what I want. Also it turns out I will get to move out with a friend soon anyway so I'm pretty content even though I don't get to live my boyfriend.

I absolutely adore when I say “I love you / I miss you” and the person on the receiving end says it back WITHOUT the added “too” on the end... (ie I miss you “too” vs I miss you).,"As the title says...and here’s a recent moment that made my heart flutter with happy. **&lt;3**

I’ve been reconnecting with a friend and in our conversation last night I text him “I’ve really missed you!” His response? “**I have missed you!**”

There’s something about it coming back in a slightly different variation and without that “too” on the end that makes it all the more special to me. I’ve wondered why I prefer it like this and feel that maybe there’s just more sincerity with it, and that it’s because they earnestly feel that way, not “in addition to my saying it” which I guess for me is what the “too” implies when it’s used. 

My heart is so content lately. I’m happy, and it’s been awhile since I’ve gotten these sweet sincere messages from anyone. So this was a nice surprise, just the way I like them at that and I didn’t ask for it that way either! He did it all his own accord! &lt;3

"Two baby Pigeon died under my supervision, I feel responsible!","I came back home from another country after 9 months just to find that my house's cleaning(where we do laundry) area had been annexed by 7-8 pigeons and they have not only laid eggs but 4 babies at 2 different places 1 nest was in a small tub and other was on a store box top which is not easy to access.

Then I thought “oh it must be my new detergent,” so I got some of that hypoallergenic stuff without perfume or color, but I was still really rashy for a week. I was getting scared that I might have covid since I went to the store, and rashes are a rare symptom. Then my physician said it might be the antidepressants since it’s a rare side effect, but we didn’t realize because I had been taking it for a few days before the allergic reaction.

So that went better than expected...,"Here's whats up, I painted one of the walls in my room with black board paint, the idea was to riff and record ideas when I'm feeling inspired, and improve my organisation if I'm honest 😅 . I make video content but when I'm recording alone for a for a good while(2+ hours), I often get a little in my head and start having complicated thoughts and feel fatigued 😩. Where I record is adjacent to the wall so I thought "" Write a list of thoughts to prime you"" This way I can look beside me and remind myself to keep that same energy you know. Naturally I got carried away and personalised it in various ways. I've doodled, added favourite lyrics and even had visitors ""tag"" it 😅😂

How is it going?  I feel focused, My organisation has improved and I'm more productive 💪🏾. I feel like I must mention the wall is the one my TV is mounted on so I'm literally looking at these messages/points/doodles/lyrics whenever I'm chilling.😋

The best bit? I can't help but smile at myself, It seems I've written a list of mantras which affirm me even when I'm not creating content.❤  I've always been positive and it hasn't been difficult to maintain but seeing little messages to remind you where I should focus my attention has had a pretty profound affect.😁 One of my favourite messages is ""You're not perfect, you never will be, and that's perfect.""🥰

I get back today and my parents can't find the damn thing. Gone out of existence. We've spent a few hours looking for it and we just can't find it. Now the lanyard is gone too, so that sucks.

We needed to order another key anyway but id like to have the original as well... plus I think the VIN is inside the door and we can't get in the car cause it's locked.

I think I've reached a new level of loneliness,"So I'm in college and my roommate and I hung out a fair amount for a few weeks after we arrived on campus, and I thought we became friends with three other girls in the hall.

Now this is where it gets interesting. Last night, I dreamt that my roommate was hanging out with two other people (she hangs out with them irl) and I was kinda upset. They went to get food and my roommate brought some back for me, saying, ""do you think I'd forget you?"" This is all I can remember.

What do American kids study in school instead of foreign languages?,"I'm Finnish (Finland, Northern Europe) and I guess most redditors don't know but we are required by law to study both English and Swedish in school and then you can make a choice (wow) to take a third foreign language out of the few others your school offers (usually German and French). There was a discussion on r/finland about Swedish and I got the idea to calculate how much time I have used (wasted) studying it including a few extra courses I took. For high school, the result was 228 hours and probably about 50 hours more on top of that official number (38 hours/course) because I did extra stuff on my own. Didn't find the hours for grades 7-9 but the search made me think about time spent learning foreign languages in general. I spent 912 hours learning English, Swedish and German in  highschool only + the English classes on grades 3-9 + the Swedish classes on grades 7-9. I don't have the numbers for students who don't take extra courses but the load is hundreds of hours anyway. Question is, what do Americans and others do with all the time they don't have to or get to spend on learning languages?

As we all know the pandemic had wreaked havoc and I'm no longer getting any support from the government but I'm still expected to pay numerous tax bills with zero income hence why I've considered jobs I wouldn't normally look at.

It has also reinforced my attitudes towards unemployment. I come from an area where a lot of people are unemployed and I've held the belief that nobody truly wants to be unemployed as it sucks. People from my rural hometown don't have much opportunity around them and when you are getting rejected from every shitty job going how can anyone stay motivated?

Anyone else a snob about the fresh produce they eat?,"Maybe it was the way I was raised. We grew up eating fresh and frozen vegetables, very rarely canned. I find myself telling my husband and (whoever will listen) what healthy things I ate that day, and ask them what *they ate*. I probably sound like a bitch.

Fresh produce is always best, if you can afford it and have access to it. Fresh tastes superior to frozen or canned in almost everything. Nothing beats a homegrown tomato or radish, but I am ashamed to admit that I *almost* prefer frozen hashbrowns to fresh.

Frozen vegetables are generally ok, I can handle frozen mixed veggies (carrot, corn, pea and green bean medley) sauteed in lot of butter or ghee and with liberal amounts of salt and pepper. Frozen green beans are better tolerated in a green-bean casserole with extra french-fried onions on top.

Canned vegetables to me have an odd texture, and they also look slimy. I can eat some of them if they are prepared and nearly hidden in a casserole. Canned corn smells and tastes odd. I try not to think about the horror of a canned mushroom I found on a pizza when I was a kid. I'm sorry, some things don't belong in a can!

Feeling terribly lonely after graduating,"I've always had a VERY hard time with genuine friendships. I recently realized I'm probably somewhere on the spectrum, so I guess that's why, but I still don't understand entirely. I try my best and I'm fairly normal. I've always been kind and caring towards all my friends.

And then every single person of my friend group ditched me the minute I graduated. They've never invited me anywhere in the first place but seeing them all post about hanging out and seeing all the snapchat videos they take together and the things I'm not getting invited to, none of them even talking to me anymore... fuck, it still sucks.

Eating fruit is so amazing,"I don’t know why but I was just eating an apple and I started really thinking about it.

I miss watching 480p videos.,"My room got renovated by the end of 2019 and in that time, I slept in the Living room of my grandma, on nothing else but a mattress.

By that time, a family member was dying, someone I really like but never tried talking to because of my failing self confidence invited me to a huge bday party and I wasn't able to play video games on my PC, so I spent the nights with watching 480p videos on my grandma's bad Wlan connection, which needed to load many times in between at some occasions.

Being forced to spend time on YouTube, I got interested and kinda nerdy on movies.
I really don't care for games that much anymore, I'm a movie guy now and I think that's an awesome evolution.

The highlight was a free Halloween 5 version on YouTube, where violent moments where strictly cut to pieces of themselves.

My parents don't let my dogs stay inside our house,"Ok, so I am a 15 yr old male in India and I have started to hate whatsapp. 

It all started a few years back, I lived at a place in a city of India and lived in apartments with my parents. It was very normal and my dogs WERE inside my house at that time. After some time, my family got our own house and when we started living there my dogs were not allowed to enter the house and they lived in the ""garage"" (it's technically not a garage and my family calls it lobby so I may use lobby instead of garage, it is basically a space where my car is parked but it's outside my house and in extreme summers and winters the conditions of my dogs get really bad) at first I did not notice too much that my dogs are not staying with me but as time went by, me and my family have had LOTTS and LOTTS of fights over this. I love my dogs and ofcourse want them to live with me, inside our house and whenever I say that I Want my Dogs to live with me I just get scolded. When I ask for a reason they say that my father is alergic to dog hair, even though we lived in the appartments and he did not show a SINGLE sign of allergic symptoms, and their other reason is that dog hair will get in my throat and I will be sick it will be bad, blah blah blah, and my mother also sometimes just emotional blackmails me saying ""don't you care about your father, do you want him to go to the hospital?"" And they read this dog hair will go in your throat in some whatsapp message and now the situations have got soo bad that I just wanna earn someway and rent a place and live their alone with my dogs. I need help as how can I get them in my house.

Boyfriend tried to fight a bear to protect me,"I saw a post about someone’s boyfriend being cute and reaching out to them while they were sleeping, and it prompted me to share this as well. 

(apologies for the format as I am on mobile, and this is my first post here)

I have been dating my current boyfriend for about 3 or 4 months, and this week we decided to try something new and go backpacking. I am fairly outdoorsy and have been backpacking several times over the last few years, while my boyfriend went once or twice in high school but has not done much in the way of hiking since. For reference, we are both in our early twenties. But anyway, earlier this week we packed up our things and enough food for three days and drove up to the mountains.

We got there fairly late in the afternoon, and only hiked a few miles before setting up camp. We cooked dinner a little ways down the trail from where we were
sleeping, hung our food up in a tree to make it difficult for any bear or critters to get at it (there are black bears where I live), set up our tent, and got cozy. It was really nice to be with him, and we stayed up talking for a while in the light of my lantern. We went to sleep around 9 or 10, excited for tomorrow and the beginning of our adventure. 

An hour or two after we had fallen asleep, I heard whining/whimpering outside our tent. We both startled awake, heard it again, and realized it must be a black bear cub. Black bears are fairly common in the area, and tend not to be a threat (unless they are continually exposed to people or given food, they are very scared of humans and usually run away when yelled at), but mama bears are a different story. They are very protective of their young, and if they perceive that their babies are in danger, they will do what it takes to protect them. 

So naturally we were terrified. A bear cub outside our tent meant that the mom was nearby, and though we may have been able to scare them away, she also was much more likely to become violent to protect her babies. 

But what stood out to me the most was that when we first heard the bear cub, my new-ish boyfriend, that had very little experience in the way of backpacking and did not know much about bears, /instinctually dove over me/ and started yelling to protect me from the bear. This man woke up from his sleep, scared and in an unfamiliar environment, and his first instinct when threatened was to protect me. I’ve never experienced that before, and I just feel really loved. He told me later he was terrified himself, but he pretended that he wasn’t worried so I would feel safe and be able to sleep.

I finished all of my requirements for the Eagle Scout Rank the day before my 18th birthday,"It's 11 PM and I just finished with my last counselor on my final merit badge.

For those that dont know, in The Boy Scouts of America, the highest rank is the Eagle rank and to achieve it, you must complete requirements and complete every other rank first. Some of these requirements need you to earn merit badges, which have their own requirements. Every last one must be done before you 18th birthday because, unless you have an extension of some sort, you are no longer a scout once 18. And some of these ranks and badges are long and hard.

I had 6 badges left as of 2 weeks ago and started this week with 4 remaining. My birthday is this friday and thanks to some very nice counselors and adults, I just barely made the rank.

The celebrity identity,"Starting my morning off right, packed a bowl and a cup of freshly brewed coffee , lounging on my porch, and lately I've been thinking. 

With this new era of technology,  I feel like anyone and anybody can start making music,  at the palm of their hands for some people. Due to this, I feel like there's going to be a change in music and how it sounds, moving forward. It'll sound more electronic in my opinion, due to beats being made on the computer as opposed to using real instruments nowadays. Not to even think about how ridiculous over priced some instruments can even be, making it hard for some people to even access making some music. 

I dont like the fact that while making music, usually these artists have to put some kind of facade in order to attract the masses. And that's just not keeping it real imo. Why do you have to create this sensational celebrity identity in order to make it to the great spots in the music industry. Because simple. It makes the views. And with many views, comes fame. But is that all that they want, is fame? Is it even about the music anymore ? If it weren't for the views/fans, they wouldn't even be famous in the first place?

Surviving 2020 - what’s your silver lining?,"This last week my grandma, mom, and aunt have been in the hospital with Covid. Today we found out my uncle has cancer. My brother and his wife are the center of the family right now and fielding all the medical communication between the hospitals and the rest of our family (thankful he is an NP and knows how to navigate). 

There isn’t a lot I can do right now. I’m sending grocery care packages to different family members and just listening. There is a sense of helplessness I’ve been feeling all year and this week just about broke me but a numbed stoicism took over.

I asked my brother if there is anything I can do since he and his family are caring most of the emotional weight for everyone right now. 

I am on moral support duty. I’m thinking of getting everyone together for a game of online poker or just a good ol’ hangout on video chat. I’m trying to think of ideas to get everyone through with some sense of normalcy in a year where everything is anything but normal. 

I was just having a conversation with someone that everyone is going through something right now. All our problems are exacerbated by the chaos. The only way we survive is managing how we cope and helping each other where we can. Knowing I can be support for my brother right now means a lot.

"My thinning hair gave me anxiety, so I cut it short and now I feel free.","I used to have a thick black shiny mane that I didn’t need to use any hair products at all. All the guys at school  were using like hair gels, wax, and sprays to style theirs but I was just proud of how naturally healthy my hair was.

Then it started thinning a few years ago and I desperately tried to find a hair style to hide my visible scalp. I began to use hair products to rigidly fix my hair in a certain position to hide it. Kinda like Johnny Bravo’s hairstyle, huge at the top and brushed up.

Recently, I’ve been using a black hair powder to coat my scalp on top so that it won’t be visible. It was a fragile technique because it needs to stay in place or it’ll be obvious.

But then yesterday was exceptionally hot, humid, and windy. By the time I got to work, my perfectly calculated hair was a mess and I looked horrible. I took the day off and stayed home. I was ashamed and frustrated. I decided to give up my hairstyle.

So I asked my wife to help me and she cut my hair short, buzzed the long sides and snipped the top into shape. I let it dry naturally into whatever natural way it wants. I went to work, people complimented my new fresh look, and I felt young for some reason.

Finally decided to go to counselling!,"I don't really have any diagnosable mental health conditions so I had been downplaying my problems for a long, long time but I've been struggling with pretty low confidence and general homesickness for a while and I've finally accepted that even though I may not be ""struggling enough,"" counselling could probably do me some good. It's taken me the better part of two years, but hey at least I've reached this point!

My uni offers online counselling, but I'm having a real hard time actually taking that next step in actually booking an appointment, and I honestly don't know how it will go. I have a lot of trouble staying focused and sticking to my decisions, so it might take me some time to actually call them up, but at least I'm no longer in denial :)

It's 4 AM and I'm crying my eyes out like an absolute idiot.,"I feel like an absolute idiot, and utterly embarrassed. I have music on, and it's my heart break playlist. I haven't cried to these songs or been effected by them in months, because I *thought* and was *positive* I was over it. Turns out I was wrong. An hour in, and I can't stop bawling my eyes out, at 4 AM.

The worst part is I'm crying over a former friendship and it's almost been a year. I feel pathetic. They're more than likely moved on, happier without me, and I'm sure don't think of me. Here's me the biggest clown the circus offers, stuck in the past who can't move on.

I wish I could go back in time, I wish I could mend the friendship. But, I can't. We're different people now. The people she has around have a vendetta towards me. She also has her first boyfriend and plenty of new friends and best friends, at this point I've been long forgotten.

“Spider-Man would be more accurate if he shot webs from his ass lol”,"Now that I have your attention, I’d like to discuss the 3 Spider-Man movie universes (referred to by the actors names).

In Sam Rami’s Spider-Man trilogy (Toby McGuire), he has organic webbing that he can shoot from his wrists. So for years I thought that’s how Spider-Man was. But then when I saw Andrew Garfield Spider-Man, I said to my sister “I don’t like that he had to make web shooters. It seems like a downgrade!” And she then told me that it was how the comics went. So I thought that was fair enough and in a way kinda cool. But unlike the comics, Andrew Garfield still at least had organic webs, so I assumed that part was also in the comics. But then I found out literally an hour ago that Tom Holland’s Spider-Man (and in the comics) doesn’t even have organic webs. He has to make them as well as the shooters.

So this brings me to 3 different points.

1. The only reason Toby McGuire Spider-Man does the finger thing is because of the comics, but if you think about it, it really makes no sense for him to do that because he doesn’t have to press the web shooter button. So it was technically just a choice he made. (I mean then again there was that little montage where he tried a bunch of different hand gestures and nothing else worked, so they did kind of address the fact that he did the same hand movement despite not having to press a button. Still tho, for what reason would it only work that way and not flat handed? Maybe tendons?)

2. Unless you’re talking about Toby McGuire Spider-Man, the only reason Spider-Man would swing on webs from his ass is if he stuck a web shooter up it. But lmao could you imagine.

3. The fact that people say “It’d make more sense if he shot webs from his ass” is all Sam Rami’s fault.",JEM--,6,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/CasualConversation/comments/imb593/spiderman_would_be_more_accurate_if_he_shot_webs/,attention like discus 3 spider man movie universe referred actor name sam ramus spider man trilogy toby mcguire ha organic webbing shoot wrist year thought spider man wa saw andrew garfield spider man said sister like make web shooter seems like downgrade told wa comic went thought wa fair enough way kinda cool unlike comic andrew garfield still least organic web assumed part wa also comic found literally hour ago tom holland spider man comic even organic web ha make well shooter brings 3 different point 1 reason toby mcguire spider man doe finger thing comic think really make sense press web shooter button wa technically choice made mean wa little montage tried bunch different hand gesture nothing else worked kind address fact hand movement despite press button still tho reason would work way flat handed maybe tendon 2 unless talking toby mcguire spider man reason spider man would swing web stuck web shooter lmao could imagine 3 fact people say make sense shot web sam ramus fault,spider man would accurate shot web lol,jem
Rate my dream,"I had a lucid dream this morning, woke up and immediately wrote down (first time ever) what I remembered as soon as i could while fighting of my drowsiness. It went on like this below;


4th Sept:
Story of a couple that grew apart and are constantly arguing. One day they stumble upon a pair of mystical rings that allows them to control the movements of the opposite bearer. Ensues a comedy of chaos and shenanigans of hell bent loose on making the other suffer. Both tired of the problems stop wearing the rings and come to a conclusion that they must work out a deal to put the rings to better use. (4.30-6.00AM, Cliffhanger)
Protagonist-Alex Wolff

I was the protagonist but for some short moments i had an outer body experience and was able to look at myself whom i looked like the actor “Alex Wolff” (i don’t even look remotely like him, I’m Asian). The couple was me and my fiancé (I’m having doubts with her and the relationship) so it could be a manifestation of my problems with her and was acting it out in my dreams.

I’m a very technical person (engineering background) but do enjoy literature a lot and would like to pursue writing if possible. Any thoughts and comments are appreciated.

When I was in school, there would always another student having a similar exact name (tho sometime just slightly different of one letter word) like mine at least in the same year if not the same class. 

I once asked my mum why. I think her answer was, before the year I was born, she'd never heard anyone of that name, until then it's somehow became popular-ish. 

Another reason I feel this way is that, my name can be broken down into a different meaning from English speakers pov i.e. ""fat in"".

"My grandma has dementia and I love her beautiful mind. Always find a rainbow in the negative things you can not change, hold on to it and never let it go.","Not sure if this is the correct place for my content but here I go. I just wanted to share some of my favorite moments I had with my grandma lately! Almost two years ago she had a double stroke which affected her short term memory. It triggered an onset of early dementia. For most people, they see it as the end of the road. It makes them sad to see their loved one lose memory and repeat themselves. For me, it doesn’t change the way I look at her. I admire her so much she’s been my rock growing up and my favorite person to be around. She raised me and my sister (not because my mother was deadbeat she just had a really demanding job that required her to be at work a lot). I keep getting texts from my mom, sister, grandpa etc telling me how she continues to tell the same story over and over again, sometimes 5 times in an hour. Let me tell you something, I love those stories no matter how many times I hear them!!! They bring her so much joy when she tells them. They are good, happy, and beautiful memories she’s decided to store. Every time she tells me she saw 5 deer in her yard the other morning, her face lights up! What a beautiful image to have and share! I’ll engage each time she tells it I’ll ask her details (although I know them, they never change). She tells me stories of her childhood growing up in Arkansas. My favorite is the one were she explores the creek by her house and finds these rocks perfectly shaped as balls. She then proceeds to get up and gift me these rock balls she’s had since she was 7 (she’s 84 now). I get excited each time she gives them to me. Little does she know I put them back where she keeps them so she can retell the story and have the joy of giving me her special rock balls. I would hate for her to not have them one day and get sad because she thinks she’s lost them. She gets so disheartened when she forgets and people have to remind her almost as if it was a nuisance to them. I just wanted to share this for the people who have family members that struggle.

I got a perfect score on my first anatomy and physiology quiz,"I was a little nervous, despite having studied for most of the week for it. 

Took it today and got a perfect 10/10. 

Not a huge deal, but it is the highlight of my week so far. Thought I’d share with someone. 🙂

Edit: I am away from my laptop at the moment, but when I get back to it, I will share some links to some helpful resources I’ve been using. Thank you all for the kind words. 😊

Edit #2: First of all, thanks again for the encouragement and kind words! I wasn't expecting it to blow up like it did, but I hope I can help those that might also be in A+P classes. 

The bulk of what I have studied so far can be found here: https://www.khanacademy.org/science/health-and-medicine/human-anatomy-and-physiology 

The quizzes really helped me, and I use them as a reference point for my flash cards. If KA isn't your thing, check out this link instead: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL8dPuuaLjXtOAKed_MxxWBNaPno5h3Zs8

Personally, I prefer KA because of the quiz function. I find it easier to take the material in little bites - usually reciting the information 3-5 times helps me retain it. 

Someone else mentioned it, but if you are trying to better understand planes (midsagittal, transverse, etc), drawing them yourself is incredibly helpful. It doesn't have to be perfect (mind are not great at all), but they were surprisingly effective.

Finally, if you are in pre-nursing as I am and are considering taking the TEAS test, I strongly recommend a few sources:

ATI TEAS Pocket Prep - Free trial download on Apple's app store 

ATI TEAS Secrets Study Guide - Shop around. You can find digital copies for as low as $6. Make sure you take notes though!

Quizlet has some good flashcards that are already made. These largely cover simple terms. I don't recommend it for helping with diagrams, which there will be a lot of, but it's good to to use for word definitions. There are a lot of different ones available. I would just run a quick Google search.  

If I think of anything else, I will be sure to add it.

I just want to say Thank You fellow Redditors! Thanks for so kindly accepting me in this virtual playground.,"This entire social media community (read Reddit) has been such safe haven for me and I’m not able to explain or convey completely the happiness I receive from playing on here with you all. The amount of joy in just being able to be myself and to feel good about that (odd because as much as I am me, so much more of me is not exposed) has been lifesaving, truly. 

You all are strangers to me. And yet I feel more comfortable and accepted here than on any other social media outlet where I have “actual friends” and even family that do not offer me the level of support, kindness and civility I find here.

Blackadder Goes Forth: Finale Thoughts and A Big Slice of Sad,"I was not born anywhere near the airing of Blackadder, but my interest was piqued when I found it recommended after Mr. Bean. A week after first stumbling on it I reach Blackadder Goes Forth, in the trenches of the Great War. The jaded sarcastic Blackadder no longer wants power, money, fame, or social standing. The fourth series is fully focused on his futile plans to escape the inevitable in the trenches.

**SPOILERS AHEAD**

Amusing, funny, the weight of what Blackadder so desperately wants doesn’t sink in until the last episode. No real plot here, the last few tries to escape are foiled (feigning madness and calling Haig for a final reprieve only to be told to feign madness). Even Darling, that cowardly codling hiding behind his notepad and pyjama folding, cannot escape. It first got dark when we see Darling cry to Melchett to not send him to the trenches, that “the car is already here”. Even the naively patriotic George is scared, for he has no intention to die. They talk of a future that seems happy but that doesn’t seem to exist. Blackadder, the most sarcastic and snarky character, says with genuine care, “Good luck everyone.” He assures Baldrick that his cunning plan must be saved for later, wished luck in a most vulnerable tone, and off they pop into the fog.

Mu eyes sweated for a good ten minutes the first time. It gave me a much more profound appreciation of the first World War. History books give a flat and purely academic view, but the ending was just so much deeper and visceral, because you see these characters with a backstory that is important, to them at least, and the distance (35 miles as Melchett said) between the fighters and the commanders. (not ragging the commanders, it was a new age of war with much different strategies, but damn I wanted to punch Melchett so much; let Darling speak you incapable bottom). George would’ve settled into the country, being the only one of his friends to survive, and Darling would’ve married Doris. 

I feel Darling’s entry into his diary sum the predicaments here nicely: Bugger.

Note also that the laughing from the audience got more unsure, and even when Blackadder made one final crack (Who would have noticed another madman around her?) there is no semblance of laughter. If the episode didn’t have the looming death of the beloved characters it would’ve been a giggle at least. They charge, as the trench fades into a poppy field, assumed to be what remains of the battlefield. Silence. No end credits, no march song, no music. Just the deafening silence punctuated by birdsong. When I said 10 minutes of eye sweat I counted from the end, but they’d begun to perspire when Darling mentioned his wish to marry Doris.

Comcast sucks.,"Once, my Dad wanted to get better internet he called Comcast to get rid of some channels. The idiot on the phone kept asking him if he wanted to upgrade his service so he has the channels AND the faster internet. After my Dad kept trying to explain he just wants to get rid of the channels, she kept persisting. For 20 minutes. We finally got the ""better"" internet which turned out to be worse. 

Another time, we were trying to get ethernet hooked up to my PC, since it had a poor connection to the new internet my Dad got to make it better. Little did we know that we had to upgrade the internet to start the ethernet plug. So my Dad calls Comcast and eventually a lady picks up. She apparently was also stupid because it took my Dad 15 minutes to explain the problem, because that stupid dum-dum couldn't understand. Eventually she told us we have to get someone to check it out, which we DIDN'T, my Dad was just trying to upgrade the service.

So a few days later the Comcast guy comes, and guess what he does? Nothing! He moves the router from the garage to the living room, and puts smaller connections that hook up to the router. He did improve the internet for me, but he did nothing to the ethernet plug, which was the original problem.

Batman the Dark Knight isn't as good as people say it is (kind of overrated).,"Now  that i caught your attention with the word overrated let's get in to why i think so.

Don't get me wrong the movie was really good the characters were well written the acting was amazing  and the directing was spectacular but it's not a 10/10 movie in my humble opinion,usually when i watch a 10/10 movie i get this feeling of OMG WHAT DID I JUST WITNESS, before watching the movie i would always hear some people saying it's one of the best movies ever made Heath ledger's performance is one of the best ever, yeas Heath Ledger gave me the feeling that that was the joker on camera not an actor but the movie is called Batman the Dark Knight it's not the story of the joker you can't say the movie was spectacular due to a supporting role I watched the movie with some pre built up hype and if not for the Harvey arc and the un appreciated debate of whether Batman should exist or not i would of gave the movie like a 6/10 (gave it a 9/10).

Same thing happened to me with Breaking Bad and i was so disappointed,

My cat and dog looked out for me today,"I was in a funk today. Well, I have been for a while but today was worse than usual. Just started my period so I was dealing with cramps all day, and I couldn't seem to find the motivation to do anything productive. I was home alone today and ended up moving from room to room, getting up to do something, forgetting what I was meaning to do, and lying down on the couch or bed or whatever to ride out the cramps. My brain just was not functional today. Finally I went and took some tylenol and took a nap, and felt much better after. I even took the dog for a walk and made a list of things I can work on tomorrow so I dont forget. My cat (6 years) and my dog (8 months) are still working on learning to get along, but today I think they knew I wasn't feeling well. They both stayed by my side almost all day, moving from room to room in my aimless wandering. My dog is usually pretty rambunctious but she was calm and napped beside me and behaved all day. My cat seemed to keep an eye on me, whether he was on my lap or  from a chair on the other side of the room. It makes my heart so full to know that even when I don't care about myself, they do.

I can't get over how good Captain America: The Winter Soldier is,"Needless to say, CA:TWS is my favorite movie in the MCU. it's even one of my favorite movies ever. I just rewatched it and I think I'll never get tired of it.

A superhero movie that doesn't feel like a superhero movie. A mix of Marvel superheroes and espionage-conspiracy is the best of both worlds for me. The pacing, writing, and action sequences are amazing. And of course the soundtrack is my favorite in the entire MCU and the best end credits next to Endgame. It feels more mature than the others and breathed a new life into the MCU.

SHIELD turning out to be the bad guys in disguise is a surprising plot twist and a great one. It kinda sucks they once could take down an entire country to being a some resistance guerilla in AOS. Finale spoilers: &gt;!Yes they're back on their feet now which is cool.!&lt;

"I finally did my nails, I'm a guy, and I found a color that will be MY color!","So I talked about this a few times before, struggle for being masculine, not feeling up to being as manly as people would hope I could be. 

For a few weeks now I have tried to get a nail polish I liked at Target and every time they have women in that nail polish department and I don't want to hover because I don't like being seen doing this just yet. 

Someone suggested just saying I was buying it for my girlfriend if anyone were to ask but I was lucky enough to have a clear aisle one day and I nabbed a purple I thought I'd like. So I'm at home putting it on, deflecting questions from male family members who think the color I chose meant something. 

The color was a pinkish purple when really I wanted a darker purple and it looked like a 4th grader did it but it was mine and I felt good for having expressed myself this way. 

Days later my best friend says she'll color my nails when we have a sleepover and she had BOXES full of nail polish! I choose a dark purple and the moment she put it on I knew I wanted THIS to be my color. It's from Essie and it's called Sexy Divide, which, I said could also be the name of a drag queen. 

It's day later and the color is really staying, I'm not doing anything different with my hands, and the color hasn't chipped or smudged at all. I still lift, do yoga, dishes, cook, and the color is still brilliant!

Music and Literature (looking for feedback/resources),"Hello!

I decided to take on a huge project.

Currently focusing on direct quotes/interpretations of authors. It is organized by author-genre-musician-song titles.  
I am getting a bit lost in the project and was hoping for some feedback to keep the momentum of my end goal. I have yet to find a complete or comprehensive list SPECIFICALLY about music and literature.

"Okay, I think I've figured it out!","There was a hot debate not long back: does a straw have two holes?

I was pretty adamant in saying it has 1 hole. But the more I think of it, I firmly believe there are two holes in a standard straw.

That is, if the straw itself is longer than the diameter of the hole.

Stay with me here.

A piece of paper with a hole punched in it. That's one hole. Hole is roughly 1/8"" in diameter, however the thickness of the paper is maybe .003""?

Now when that paper is 1"" and we drill a hole through it with a 1/8"" drill bit. That bitch has two holes in it.

Take a straw. Cut it to a length That's smaller than the diameter of the suckhole. It now has one hole, unlike a full frown straw.

What kind of things do you usually do on your Phone?,"Howdy! I have never been a big smartphone user at all, very much the opposite.

Games?

Social Media?

I love Boards of Canada.,"They are my favorite musician/band/collective of all time.  If I was being shot into outerspace to spend the rest of my existence nude and in solitude, and could take the discography/tracklist of only one artist, it would be Boards of Canada.  I'm not even that familiar with the ambient/idm or whatever genre they are; I am confident that BoC is capable of transcending anyone's musical taste and able to be enjoyed by a variety of different people with different tastes.   Boards creates a very unique atmosphere, and evokes a range of emotions experienced all throughout life and even beyond, somehow.  There are no vocals, which may be a deal-breaker for some people... but at the same time the perfect tool for those that wish to drift out into the abstract abyss.   

For those who are interested in hearing what all the ruckus is about, I have hand selected some gems... of Canada... nope, that didn't sound as cool as I had hoped.  It's times like these that I regret making that lifelong vow to never again hit the backspace/delete buttonn.. Dammit!

What is your imagination like and how do you think?,"I've been wondering recently how other people think and what their inner monologue is like, given they have them. For any who don't know, an inner monologue is the voice inside your head when you think. Not everyone has one, so I was wondering how people's imaginations work.

So to begin with, if I were to ask you to imagine an apple, what would you see? You don't physically see anything, correct? You just know you're picturing an apple? For me, I can perfectly think of a three dimensional apple with all of its irregularities and blemishes. I can rotate it, turn it upside down, imagine a knife and cut into it, see inside, and turn the apple whatever color I want it to be. All of the color differences still remain the same, and there are still size irregularities as a normal apple would. I believe some people are just unable to imagine an apple in the first place? What are you able to see and describe? 

Now are you able to imagine a place? Like your room or a nearby park? I can imagine any place that I've been to, and essentially navigate my way around the area. Almost like a Google Maps Street View, but in my head. I have gaps in my memory for larger areas, but for the most part I can think of a clear picture. Can you only think of the idea of the place? Or can you see it from a third person perspective?

Lastly, what is your inner monologue like? I am always thinking to myself or have a song playing in my head. I think to myself about all kinds of random things with some little voice that goes on in my head, which I imagine sounds like my own voice. However, if I know a person's or a song's voice well enough, I can remember exactly how it sounds and manipulate their voice to make them say whatever they want. If it's a song, they can say whatever, but it has to go along with the song's pitch, tone, rhythm, and all that. I'm essentially replacing the lyrics. What do you all think of, if you have an inner monologue? For those who don't, are you able to describe what goes on in your mind? I've spent a few minutes thinking about what I'm going to include in this post, basically going over what questions I want to ask and the wording, and I'm interested to see how other people think. 

Let me know what you all are able to do and if there are any other questions you have for other people! Also if there's something special that you have in your mind, I would love to know!",TheRunningScientist,12,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/CasualConversation/comments/im6g8u/what_is_your_imagination_like_and_how_do_you_think/,wondering recently people think inner monologue like given know inner monologue voice inside head think everyone ha one wa wondering people imagination work begin ask imagine apple would see physically see anything correct know picturing apple perfectly think three dimensional apple irregularity blemish rotate turn upside imagine knife cut see inside turn apple whatever color want color difference still remain still size irregularity normal apple would believe people unable imagine apple first place able see describe able imagine place like room nearby park imagine place essentially navigate way around area almost like google map street view head gap memory larger area part think clear picture think idea place see third person perspective lastly inner monologue like always thinking song playing head think kind random thing little voice go head imagine sound like voice however know person song voice well enough remember exactly sound manipulate voice make say whatever want song say whatever ha go along song pitch tone rhythm essentially replacing lyric think inner monologue able describe go mind spent minute thinking going include post basically going question want ask wording interested see people think let know able question people also something special mind would love know,imagination like think,running scientist

"When I created this account two years ago, I’d slipped a disk in my back and was cuddling up with my ex’s dog and codene. I deadlifted 110kg the other day","Funny to think about that. The last two years have been a blur.

My back is a lot better now. I’ve been doing powerlifting for a little while. For a long time I was playing it safe. Always lifting less than I thought I could, to be safe. In my mind, the Injury felt like it had happened maybe 12 months ago..

I walked in one day and thought “fuck it, Let’s see how high I can go comfortably”

I deadlifted 110kg (242lbs) on a [trap bar ](https://www.ironedge.com.au/chrome-trap-bar.html?gclid=EAIaIQobChMItvbqubHO6wIVm30rCh01JwpBEAQYASABEgIGwfD_BwE) (weight 120kg / 264lbs height 183.5cm / 6.02”).

Two days later I took the leap across to a conventional straight bar. Figured if I’m lifting 110kg on a trap, then I could probably try a lower weight on the normal bar. 100kg was ok, a little to much to work with so I dropped it to 90kg (198lbs). That felt good. 

I wouldn’t say my life has been a consistent upward inspiration story since then, but the trend is good at least. 

I have a better job that serves an important purpose in the community. I feel happy knowing that my job is contributing to saving lives (healthcare worker).

I got diagnosed with ADHD and have been seeing improvement from medication. I meditate more. 

I’m happier single (my ex is a wonderful woman, just not the right one for me). 

I even had my first birthday single in a good 5 years...and it was one of my favourites. I worked out, got invited to a bbq and had dinner with a friend. In fact I didn’t even get a present from anyone that day (family lives overseas, my friends are all poor students) and it was still one of the nicest, most relaxed birthdays I’ve had. 

So yeah, happy cake day to me :)",HairyAwareness,0,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/CasualConversation/comments/im76px/when_i_created_this_account_two_years_ago_id/,funny think last two year blur back lot better powerlifting little long time wa playing safe always lifting le thought could safe mind injury felt like happened maybe 12 month ago walked one day thought fuck let see high go comfortably deadlifted 110kg 242lbs trap bar http www ironedge com au chrome trap bar html gclid eaiaiqobchmitvbqubho6wivm30rch01jwpbeaqyasabegigwfd_bwe weight 120kg 264lbs height 183 5cm 6 02 two day later took leap across conventional straight bar figured lifting 110kg trap could probably try lower weight normal bar 100kg wa ok little much work dropped 90kg 198lbs felt good say life ha consistent upward inspiration story since trend good least better job serf important purpose community feel happy knowing job contributing saving life healthcare worker got diagnosed adhd seeing improvement medication meditate happier single ex wonderful woman right one even first birthday single good 5 year wa one favourite worked got invited bbq dinner friend fact even get present anyone day family life overseas friend poor student wa still one nicest relaxed birthday yeah happy cake day,created account two year ago slipped disk back wa cuddling ex dog codene deadlifted 110kg day,hairy awareness

"I think I found a twin flame, and I'm so grateful","A while ago I'd read about this phenomenon called twin flames, and for those of you who don't know, it's like this concept similar to a soulmate except this person is like your mirror. They reflect your greatest weaknesses and strengths alike and seem to have some sort of transformative purpose in your life.

When I did come by this, I thought it was pretty interesting but also like one of those super idealistic things that people aspire to have because it's too good to be true. 

About a month ago, however, I did befriend someone who is honestly like the male version of myself. It's like our pain and grief is so alike that there's this effortless bond we share and as someone who doesn't feel like an open book, it's just so easy and it feels so right to talk to him and share my life to him. Our connection is very much platonic and our friendship just feels like magic. In a matter of weeks I think he's known me better than my friends have for years.

Regardless of where life takes us, I know I'll always be here for him and I just wholeheartedly want and wish for his happiness. He's gonna do some incredible things with his life and I can't wait to see his dreams come true. So thankful he exists.

This summer they’ve completely pushed me out, I don’t remember the last time I was invited to anything, but I changed a lot over quarantine and started to not give a shit about stuff that made me feel bad. I completely stopped caring, but every once in a while I would go to group events. This month they’ve completely pushed me out, I see them together every night and no one asks to me to come.

I really want to apply for a job but I’ve been postponing it for weeks cause I’m scared as fuck.,"I just finished my career. My country is still in quarantine. I’m unemployed. I’m 23. I basically do nothing besides reading books and watching series. I’m desmotivated. I want to feel productive. I need money. 

...and there’s this company hiring, which doesn’t require 251827+ years of experience and allows me to work from home. 

The #1 thing is: it’s completely in English. Completely. 100% excellent English skills, it says. 

The #2 thing is: English is not my native language. It’s actually Spanish! I’ve been learning English for years, since I was a little girl. I’m not bad at it, I’m writing this completely on my own... but what if I fuck up? What if I’m on a Zoom meeting and forget how to say a word? What if I get to work with someone who talks English really fucking fast and I have to “uh, uh, can you repeat please?” Or what if I fuck up on an email or chatting with a customer? 

The #3 thing is: If I’m a shy and introverted bitch even when I speak Spanish, I can’t imagine how I’d be speaking in English + ON A JOB!!!! 

The #4 thing is: Oh, man. Sometimes I wake up and say, fuck it, I’ve been studying English since I was like 3 years old. I’m going to apply, that job is fucking mine. Then I have to complete the first step: recording a video talking about myself and answering some questions. Then a test. Then a job interview......... Oh you know what?! Never mind.

Do you ever feel weirdly nostalgic for crappy times in your life?,"I was cooking dinner tonight and a smell took me back about 6 ago. I was in a run-down home with a crappy boyfriend who treated me fairly poorly. I was absolutely miserable. Tonight I was instantly reminded of that time in my life and I felt weirdly nostalgic.

This happens often, about 3 or 4 years ago I went through a rough phase, I was depressed, anxious, and I was drowning my sorrows in drugs and alcohol.  I often hear music from that time and it makes me want to go back. Again there is a weird comfort feeling even though I was in a very dark place.

Thanks for motivating me strangers.","I was just responding to some messages on a plants community on reddit. Its so lovely to see all these people really love and care for their plants. There is so much to learn for me. 

Similarly there have been so many other communities i constantly learn from just watching no need to post comment anything. Just curious stuff some funny some few not so great. 

I joined reddit to help with not smoking I did not succeed yet, but I do feel a part of many communities, fasting, plants, health, nature etc.

 Absolute strangers without their real name helping each other out. I feel like if there is anything I think I can't ask my friends and family I can ask this bunch of strangers who don't judge me but will answer. I love that.

 Its helped me more since my dad passed away. I never knew how much it hurt till it did. The weirdest post is after that we have to continue life and slowly you get busy with work and that keeps your mind occupied you learn to live on. You see that so many more are doing trying and living the same pain. So at least I can do is say what I know it what I did. Share. 

I especially love the ask reddit ones where as you read the comments it gets funnier and funnier.  This really are a total joy these plp total nuts making me laugh.  If you are the funny kind don't stop we stupid serious guys need you to teach up the way to laugh through these times.

What is it that stops us from achieving what we know we want ?,I've been wasting bunch of my times lately! It isn't like I'm ignorant about what I'm doing and what might be the consequence of this procrastination. I know how this pandemic is affecting lives and all about disturbing mental health of people and hovering anxiety everyone is trapped under. I'm not panicky. I'm stable. But I can't figure out why.. why in this world am I not able to do what's right for me. My mind knows on what I should focus more on. My mind keeps on repeating this so many times that I believe this thought which at once used to be a short term memory has now consolidated into a long term one and now my mind has stored it for eternity! I wanna get rid of these thoughts and I wanna start working for it. I lack motivation and confidence now. I'm competitive. I like to be one! But now I don't know what is happening outside in the world of others like me. I don't know how much they have acquired because noone tells the exact truth!

The bond between a master and an old dog is such a unique relationship.,"It’s not quite your best friend because friends are autonomous, they don’t wait on you to be able to tend for their needs. Also, an healthy relationship excludes the concept of being someone’s master.

It’s a bit like taking care of your grandma/grandpa but it’s got the energy of a toddler and also the self-awareness of a toddler but the routines of an aged person. 

It’s a powerful bond, a very sincere one, between two living things experiencing life on very different levels. 

I never *had* a dog before I moved in with my girlfriend a few years back. I never cared much for pets but spending my daily life with one, we came to a point where she shows respect for me, listens to my commands, seeks petting and is so f-ing stoked to see me whenever I come in.

How did you overcome nail biting?,"Hey! I have managed to stop nail biting around 3 months ago. I did it using self control and a motivation from sympathy I've met online around that time. My nails are now pretty healthy (almost two decades of nail biting made them shorter, but they are not gross anymore), I still struggle with ""not putting them in my mouth"", but there is no biting - when the urge is overwhelming, I file them short to stop myself. I hate clipping them, makes me really uncomfortable.

Before that I felt really embarassed when meeting new people, especially girls. But stopping was really, really hard. I was doing it involuntarily, even when trying to focus on not doing it. My last best try was 2 months of no biting in a row.

The embarassment got really bothering when I met a girl online and we were sharing photos. Everytime I wanted to show something ""on my hand"" or including my hand was a pain in the ass, trying to hide my gross nails (or what was left of them). Decided enough is enough.

Now I can grab stuff without pain, use nails to open some things (like some ports/flaps in phones etc.) and not be embarassed by gross looking hands.

TIL that I’m a manic pixie dream girl and things are making sense in a whole new way,"Doing some postmortem texting with my ex tonight and he says, “My brain was poisoned by a combination of 80s and 90s pop culture that resulted in the whole ‘manic pixie dream girl’ phenomenon but crossed with the example of my parents as a couple demonstrating the whole ‘couples don’t spend time together’ unless they have to model.”

Fair enough. 

But, as I had never heard of MPDG, I consulted with Professor Google.

The [manic pixie dream girl](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manic_Pixie_Dream_Girl) trope ""exists solely in the fevered imaginations of sensitive writer-directors to teach broodingly soulful young men to embrace life and its infinite mysteries and adventures.”

Finally lost a little bit of weight,"First time poster here, just wanted to share with someone that I finally lost weight without having to go on a massive diet.

I'm 21, male, 198cm (6ft 6). I've always struggled with being overweight, but ever since I left home to go to uni I've been gaining a fair bit of weight, even with going to the gym 3 times a week. I was starting to get a bit of a big belly, started having to buy bigger clothes, and I hated it. It really was taking a toll on my mental health.

Before I went to uni 3 years ago I was just around 100kg (220lbs). Last time I weighed myself was in March at 127kg (280lbs). I wanted to never go over 130kg (286lbs) so I ended getting scared of weighing myself.

This morning, I felt slimmer than usual, got the balls to weigh myself and I'm at 122kg (270lbs)!!!! I never thought this day would happen. I feel so incredibly happy, and it's motivated me loads to continue (without turning to obsession)

I decided to change my habits start of July by just trying to eat less processed sugar. Examples:
-Not having a soda every evening, maybe just water (and a lot of it).
-If I'm hungry at some point in the afternoon, a banana instead of a packet of biscuits or loads of cake
-And the most important of all was to slow down when I'm eating and being ok with not eating desert or leaving leftovers if I feel full up.

Thanks for listening (or reading lmao), just needed to share this with someone, I hope it doesn't look like a ramble!

I’ve also got enough stuff in my kitchen to start a small Starbucks and making my own Pumpkin Spice Lattes has been a very relaxing and tasty part of my day. These little parts of my week make being home from college a lot more bearable (I’m spending my last semester here which is a bummer).

Whats the nicest way to get your roommates to stop using your stuff?,"I feel like its easier when its your toothbrush or your game console, but what about a car? Right now the whole house is going through some money struggles and we're all in this together, or at least that's the state of mind im trying to have.
Within the last year I've finally gotten to the point where I can get a wonderful and not super old car! But at the same time, my roomies just got their car repossessed. I told them if they needed it they could absolutely use it especially to and from work.
After damn near all of my tires got messed up and having to borrow money from my Dad just to get going again, i really dont want them to use it at all. Itd be fine if they asked me before hand or if they helped with the car payment, if they were going to interviews or even if they were working towards getting another car but no. 
I have a fear of being used and this is of course not sitting right with me. I'm trying to not let it bother me but everyday its something new(on top of the car situation). I was really hoping the ""I wont ask you to be respectful of my things because I hope you're not a dick"" approach would work but it seems like they've all just gotten way too comfortable? 
On one hand, i feel like a jerk. On the other hand, what the flip, this is my only transportation and if it gets messed up I dont think they're gonna help me get a new one. I hate confrontation and dont want to upset anyone but by doing that, ive been the only one upset.
Am I being a jerk and how do i get them to chill or take more responsibility?",Oversednupset,2,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/CasualConversation/comments/im3qx5/whats_the_nicest_way_to_get_your_roommates_to/,feel like easier toothbrush game console car right whole house going money struggle together least state mind im trying within last year finally gotten point get wonderful super old car time roomy got car repossessed told needed could absolutely use especially work damn near tire got messed borrow money dad get going really dont want use itd fine asked hand helped car payment going interview even working towards getting another car fear used course sitting right trying let bother everyday something new top car situation wa really hoping wont ask respectful thing hope dick approach would work seems like gotten way comfortable one hand feel like jerk hand flip transportation get messed dont think gonna help get new one hate confrontation dont want upset anyone ive one upset jerk get chill take responsibility,whats nicest way get roommate stop using stuff,sed n upset

Arguments on reddit or the lack there of.,"I always find it facinating when commenting on controversial posts or just scanning through them that there are threads where people aimlessly jump on bandwagons voicing their opinions but mostly, if not always, lashing out when their arguments are countered or contradicted. 

These types of threads I find amusing at times, but also rather alarming at how people just seem to forget that an opinion is just that, an opinion, and that other people will have a different opinion that contradicts there's, even though they are voicing/adressing the same issues (whatever that may be). The alarming part is what I can only describe as the mindset of these individuals that cannot entertain an idea or opinion, or simply just stop arguing midway through an argument once a valid point is made without a single admittance to the validity of the argument. 

There have been a few occasions where fellow redditors have left me sitting on the edge of my chair within the thread comment's, arguing without being rude, arguing without criticism or harsh outbreaks of "" you #@$%, you know @%#^!!!"" with the obvious downvote spam there after. Arguments where the loser admits defeat gracefully and coming away from it for the better. 

I feel uplifted when I do find these comment's, however the majority of things, aspecially relating to political opinions, gender based issues, civil rights issues, and more recent issues such as the BLM movements and carona related issues that there is a lack of coherent arguments on reddit and it just feels like it's becoming a facebook rant all over again (reddit is far better but the vibe is present). 

I would just like to know your opinions on the matter, and why you, fellow redditor's, agree or disagree that people no longer know how to argue and entertain valid or non valid opinions?",monsterted,1,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/CasualConversation/comments/ilyww6/arguments_on_reddit_or_the_lack_there_of/,always find facinating commenting controversial post scanning thread people aimlessly jump bandwagon voicing opinion mostly always lashing argument countered contradicted type thread find amusing time also rather alarming people seem forget opinion opinion people different opinion contradicts even though voicing adressing issue whatever may alarming part describe mindset individual cannot entertain idea opinion simply stop arguing midway argument valid point made without single admittance validity argument occasion fellow redditors left sitting edge chair within thread comment arguing without rude arguing without criticism harsh outbreak know obvious downvote spam argument loser admits defeat gracefully coming away better feel uplifted find comment however majority thing aspecially relating political opinion gender based issue civil right issue recent issue blm movement carona related issue lack coherent argument reddit feel like becoming facebook rant reddit far better vibe present would like know opinion matter fellow redditor agree disagree people longer know argue entertain valid non valid opinion,argument reddit lack,monster ted
Someone complimented my tattoo today,"I’m a new student at the university I go to.

I’m tired of customers treating me like shit for things out of my control on a daily basis,"I’m a waitress because I’m in college and it’s the only job that will work with my class schedule and where I can make a living.

I got screamed at tonight by a customer because I told her that we couldn’t do the substitution she wanted. It is not my rule, it’s the owners. Then they kept making fun of me the whole time they were there. I’m just sick of it... my husband is struggling with severe depression, I’m working 40 hour weeks, going to school full time... I’m barely keeping my head above water. 

Anyways. If you’ve read this far, thank you. Just a friendly reminder to be kind to people. We don’t make up the rules most of the time.

Password crazy,"I am so exhausted I’m having to keep up with so many accounts and passwords.  Seems like I have more than 50, including work related and personal. Each time u have to do something online, seems to be you gotta download an app, create ID linked to an email and a password.   Now every few months u have to change the password.  If you change phones, computer-laptop or desk top, u must re-download and re use the I’d and password which was automatically saved by your old device which made it easy for you but now u can’t access it.  
This drives me crazy and I am super annoyed about it.  I used to have an app in which I saved all my passwords and log in’s.  I changed cellphones from galaxy to iPhone.  The app was downloaded but there was nothing under my saved information.   This was never an issue for ppl of my generation.  You need to pay a bill, it comes in the mail and u send a check back.  No secret if or passwords.  No change of passwords either.  Now my son told me that the iCloud saves the passwords for you.  How do I get to then iCloud password storage?  He does not know how and neither do I.  Does the iCloud keep this a secret from me?  I’m the one who is supposed to manage this.  

I am in my 50s and wanted to track all of this on paper but the anger it induces paralyzes my actions.  I write them down and get overwhelmed by the sheer number of accounts.  
Then the stupid junk mail that comes in feels like I’m being harassed.  I unsubscribe but they keep coming back months later.  

I want to close the damn accounts but in today’s world it seems impossible to function unless u spend 3hrs of ur day online managing ur personal life.  I could be fucking or enjoying a pedicure  and or enjoying the beauty of this world.  

Any idea to make it easier for me other than downloading another app?",caramelo52,8,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/CasualConversation/comments/im0jcl/password_crazy/,exhausted keep many account password seems like 50 including work related personal time u something online seems gotta download app create id linked email password every month u change password change phone computer laptop desk top u must download use password wa automatically saved old device made easy u access drive crazy super annoyed used app saved password log changed cellphone galaxy iphone app wa downloaded wa nothing saved information wa never issue ppl generation need pay bill come mail u send check back secret password change password either son told icloud save password get icloud password storage doe know neither doe icloud keep secret one supposed manage 50 wanted track paper anger induces paralyzes action write get overwhelmed sheer number account stupid junk mail come feel like harassed unsubscribe keep coming back month later want close damn account today world seems impossible function unless u spend 3hrs ur day online managing ur personal life could fucking enjoying pedicure enjoying beauty world idea make easier downloading another app,password crazy,caramel 52

Who else just doesn’t like alcohol and its effects?,"I’m not a fan of the way multiple types of alcohol taste (or any, really), but I also have never enjoyed the way it feels in my body. All of my drinking has been slowly paced in very small amounts, always with a full stomach and extra water, but I always get a pounding headache and end up feeling stupid and slow for the next hour or two.

I’ve felt *slight* euphoria from alcohol before, but only for short moments before a dull headache sets in. Even the expensive stuff doesn’t feel or taste good at all to me. I get why others might like it though, after having tried many different types.

I just turned 21, but even the few times I drank before that, it just didn’t do it for me. I feel like if I ever were to drink anything quickly or allow myself to get drunk, I would *hate* it based on how I feel when it’s appropriately paced. I guess it just isn’t my drug, no big deal. I got a free bottle of champagne from the restaurant where I had my birthday dinner, so I just gave it to my friend for a housewarming gift.

I reconciled with an old friend yesterday,"So a little backstory is that my friend and I stopped talking to each other for almost a year now. I felt like I said some things that shouldn’t have been said. I finally took the initiative to talk to them about some things I done that was nagging at me this whole time. I’m so proud of myself for even reaching out to her because if I hadn’t, we would still be in that phase of not talking to each other. 

It turns out she wasn’t even mad at me for that. She thought she did something wrong with us and went into depression. She didn’t want to talk to me because she thought I was mad at her, which was completely understandable. At the end of the day we shared deep issues about ourselves that we didn’t know about the other. It made me think about the situation in her shoes instead of looking at her like she was some villain whilst victimizing myself.

We had a long talk and tears were shed, but I felt like a weight was lifted off my shoulders. I really needed to have that talk and we are back to talking terms. I know this will take awhile to get back to where we used to be but I’m so glad this happened bc she really was (and is) a great friend :)",bella_256,0,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/CasualConversation/comments/ilrhla/i_reconciled_with_an_old_friend_yesterday/,little backstory friend stopped talking almost year felt like said thing said finally took initiative talk thing done wa nagging whole time proud even reaching would still phase talking turn even mad thought something wrong u went depression want talk thought wa mad wa completely understandable end day shared deep issue know made think situation shoe instead looking like wa villain whilst victimizing long talk tear shed felt like weight wa lifted shoulder really needed talk back talking term know take awhile get back used glad happened bc really wa great friend,reconciled old friend yesterday,bella 256

So I took the challenge and simply googled which one is the easiest cake to bake and settled on glucose biscuit one.

My Dad sold my stuff and I cant get over it,"I bought a giant white board and when it came, Amazon mixed it up and I ended up with a weight bench. I was really excited to have it and its still in the box since I dont have anywhere to put it in the house. I figured id take it when I move out in a couple years

My Dads been cleaning up the basement and has been living on Facebook marketplace. I could care less, as hes been selling stuff that none of us use.

But then he goes ""Oh you know the weight bench WE got from Amazon that nobody uses? I got a bite right away."" 

I was like oh I kind of wanted that

Anybody here drop out of college?,"I'm on my 2nd year of Electronic Engineering but my will to learn these subjects has faded.

My Goddaughter made me feel very uncomfortable and then made me burst out laughing. It was good.,"Earlier this week my husband and I found out that a dear friend was in a medically induced coma after her battle COVID went awry. 

It was a very hard day for me. My goddaughter and her family live with us, and being a very empathetic 6 yearold wanted to know why I was crying and what our friend looked like and every other detail. 

I had told her about my friend. Her love of animals, and anime, and general appreciation of being goofy af. I then made the mistake of mentioning to her mother, in front of my goddaughter, that I can't  imagine how hard it is on my husband. 

After my husband came home she asked him why it was going to be harder on him. He said he was very close to her. My goddaughter didn't buy it, but was easy to distract.

Later I told her how our friend lived with me for a time, and a much longer time with my husband, and then i added that my husband used to make kissy faces with our friend!

My goddaughter immediately said my husband's name very sternly. My husband laughed as he tried to explain the whole we haven't been together since birth thing, and she was still upset because he should have know that we were meant to be. 

She still gives him the side eye about it. I think I may let it go on a day or so longer before I explain to her that I also.lived with someone I made kissy faces with.

I feel like I've grown up,"[16M] I feel like my viewpoint towards everything has changed.I can no longer play with the kids of the neighborhood without feeling different. Everytime I have to make a decision or contribute to a conversation,  I surprise myself with the foresight I seem to have developed.
For the past three years, all I've done is prepare for a particular examination that decides the college I can go into. I've worked pretty hard for it, and have always been stressed about how I will perform on the actual D-day. But now, this lockdown thing slipped in, and the whole scenario seems to have taken a 180°. The exam is tomorrow, which also happens to be my cake day, and I'm absolutely carefree.
I'll wake up tomorrow and go give the exam and be over with it, however it goes. It's just a weird feeling, that I'm not worried anymore about a thing that matters so much. I still work for it, but am not afraid of it. This strange , hermit like attitude seems to have sprung up, that I'll be happy with whatever college I get into.
 Entropy seems to have boiled down.
Just wanted to share:)

I have one year to get independent and it scares me.,"I've recently turned 17. I still have 2 high school years ahead of me. I live in a ""farm"" in Romania. Due to fights between me and my parents about me not pursuing the farmer life, I have one year left at home. 

I attend to a good school, 60km away from home in a city. At weekdays I stay at a dorm payed by my parents, and the maximum of necessary time I spend in school daily is between 7 am and 3 pm.

I have no money. I have never had a job what payed me. I've planned on working this summer, but pandemic happened and I got rejected. 

I plan to get a night shift job at the city, so I can earn money and attend school, but I absolutely don't know how to do it. I don't know where to look or what to say.  The cherry on top is that I'm a minority and I can't even speak Romanian fluently. 

The other option is to spend this year getting good at coding, and finding a job online. My best language is C++, but I'm really far from a professional level. I don't know if it's manageable to learn it under a year to a level I can work with, and I don't know if even I managed to do that, would I find someone to apply me?

I guess I'm just excited and feeling optimistic about the future for the first time in years. I don't know where the road goes from here, but I know the one I was on was going nowhere. No amount of money is worth the loss of your mental health, folks.

What's some good news you got this year?,"Or just something that happened and made you happy.

This year saw many catastrophes but I tend to be the optimistic one and there's lots of good that happened in my life this year.

Firstly, I finished my first year of college, and it feels like I finally discovered a place where I fit in. Stuff I've been bullied for so long, now are considered cool (can you imagine, me cool) and I actually have friends now. Genuine friends!

Not only that but I got good grades and I'm up for a scholarship. With that I could finally get myself a drum kit!

A drum kit as this year I also finished my additional drum classes, and I can say that _I'm licensed in drumming_ :))

On top of that, I was a volunteer at the first reptile expo of my country (that was in Feb) and seeing and interacting with all those cool creatures and fantastic people that loved them wholeheartedly just warmed my heart enough to make a second sun.

My first commissions also took place this year! I'm far from being a pro artist but I felt so proud when the clients loved the work I did for them.

Also, managed to get real fossils for cheap from the paleontological institute, which I tracked the location of with the aid of a new college friend. Picture two young adults in total awe at the geology museum :)

And to top it off, after 4 years of jumping through hoops I managed to finally get myself a bearded dragon, my dream pet. His name is Raysip, he's 2 months old and he just ate from my hand ❤️

As you can see, in my case there have been plenty of good fortunes. Sure, there have been bad incidents too but I chose to anchor myself in the ones that made me happy.

I’ve felt this way for a long time, and I can’t talk to anyone about it because everyone takes it a certain way and interprets something out of it when I mean only and exactly what I say.

I really have no one to talk to, yes I have acquaintances but I feel like I have no friends, no people who are genuinely there for me emotionally. And it’s not an issue, I’ll wake up tomorrow and do the same thing I’ve always done and I’ll think “man texting them was a bad idea.” “Man making that Reddit post wasn’t a good idea.” But fuck it. I’m alone right now. 

It’s not even that I want to be with someone, I’m so confused about myself, about how to manage emotions. About why I’m doing anything I do. About where to go from here, about how to make sense of it all.

How I gain confidence?,"Hello! I'm 17 years old and I have had low self-esteem for a long time. Until 10 the grade, I wasn't conscious of it, but now I see how detrimental is this lack of confidence for my life. 
Do you some advice for me? I would like to add also I am an introvert person with a few acquaintances ( I couldn't call them friends). I have one girl who I consider a closer person to me, only. 

PS: I live in an isolated village from Europe, with no close relatives and after my dad's death I started to isolate myself from the village. I have  horrible neighbours who have attempted to beat my parent( mom).
Also, I have an overprotective mom, who considers studies more important than social life. What's worse, I listened to her up to high school, where I have the opportunity to see a new medium.


 In order to carry on my studies in high school, I study in another city 50 km from home and I stay at a host, who has a big impact on my realisation that I must change.

Now, do you think I could be more confident if I talked to my mom about my problems. I had a discussion with my host about my problem from the past and she spoke to my mom, but... Afterward, I do not have any discussion with my parent. She just said that there is no point in considering myself a mess and that I am a beautiful person....that's all...

Do you remember life before the Internet?,"I was born in 1987. Thinking back to the 90's is amazing, because I remember such great times. Very few, if anyone, had Internet.

I remember TGIF on Friday nights, which included the TV shows Full House, Step by Step, and Family Matters. I remember watching Saved by the Bell in the afternoons. There were great Saturday morning cartoons. Pro wrestling was at its peak with WCW and WWF on Monday nights. People read magazines and newspapers. They watched and rented VHS tapes and later DVDs from video stores. People listened to CDs. Sega Genesis, SNES, PlayStation 1, and N64 were in the 90's. People interacted in person a lot more, and spent a lot more time outside.

In many ways, thinking back to the 90's is like paradise. It was certainly a lot more carefree than the 20 later. It was a better time in a lot of ways. I also can't stand most modern TV shows. I'd watch those 90's shows over almost any show today. Practically all modern shows look like complete crap, in my opinion.

Let me share my pain with you,"My gf is trying to buy a ""gaming PC"" for her, so she can do her work and college stuff. She needs a decent computer, good enough to deal with Autocad 3D, and other softwares, and play The Sims. 

The problem is , either she has to spend 4 salaries (minimum wage) for a decent PC, or it won't even run Minecraft 1080p@60fps. Options below that price are really bad, that they are just not worth the price. So either she spends a lot of money, or don't spend at all. 

If this was for anyone else, I would just say to get a trash GPU, focus on CPU and good RAM and later on buy a new GPU, but she needs a good one. But it's exactly the most expensive part.

"Buy yourself a desk, don't just try to manage between the dining room/kitchen table and the sofa or your bed.","I realize that not everyone is fortunate to have the space or funds to do this. I am very lucky to 1 have a job, and 2 no real problems compared to many others. I've been working at home for 6 months. At work i have a standing desk, and a modest window. For 6 months i thought the dining room table (with a box on it to stand the laptop), and the sofa (for a treat!) were fine substitutes, even a fun change perhaps. But since the kids starting zoom school last week I swiftly realized that my being driven to the bedroom (yikes, I did not want to work from f****** bed) or the almost outside shed like space wasn't going well. Procrastination was high, output low, mood terrible and generally i realized I've been more and more disengaged. I worked hard to make my kids nice zoom school work spaces, i looked at their workspaces and thought er i should really do this for myself. Im really tight with money, but I gave up and bought a standing desk. Cleared out the halfway, and i now gave a very simple, minimal set up. Laptop on a stand, wireless keyboard and mouse, and a coaster. I've been so much more engaged, happy, productive, and creative. I feel relieved i have an actual work space. 10/10 feel better.

"I had my first disgruntled customer experience at my job today, and I loved it!","I got a new job recently at a grocery store near my house. After doing absolutely nothing for the majority of quarantine, I’m super happy I finally got a job so I can finally start saving up for university, as well as finally having something to do.

Today was my first day in training and my supervisor had me working the cash register while she watched over me just so I could learn the ropes. Everything was going quite smoothly (besides me turning to my supervisor every minute or so to ask what the fruit that I’m holding is) until this older gentleman walks up to the cash. He mumbled something through his mask that I couldn’t hear, so I assumed it was some sort of friendly greeting. I scanned his items and he pulled out some cash to pay, but as he was handing it to me he pulled back all of a sudden and mumbled something again, to which I asked if he could repeat himself as my hearing isn’t the greatest. He suddenly shouts back to me “3 BAGS!”. I quickly apologize and hand him the bags. As he’s packing his groceries I apologize to him for the inconvenience and explain that I’m new and that it’s my first day on the job. His response? “Yeah you’re the greatest staff member to ever work here huh.”

I am Genderqueer.,"I kinda just want to scream this from the rooftops that I’ve finally come to this realization. I’m not a boy or a girl, I’m something in between, but also it doesn’t matter to me if people think I’m a boy or a girl. Most people see me and assume I’m a girl. Some little kids see me and assume I’m a boy. People have called me sir when they see me at a glance, and then stumble to correct themselves. I always tell them that it’s okay, and they think I’m just being polite, but I’m really not offended. Ma’am, sir, pal; anything works for me. They’re all correct, I am all of the above and non at all. 

I just exist. I just am. Realizing this part of my identity has made me feel so much more free. It’s okay that I am the way that I am. It’s okay for me to express my gender however I please, and people who have a problem with it don’t deserve to be in my life. I hope that everyone who reads this is comfortable in their own skin and feels like they can express themselves the way they want. It’s such a good feeling. When I stood my ground and stopped letting people force me to fit a mold all the time it was like I met myself for the first time. I’m genderqueer, I am good looking, and I have friends that know and except me for it. That’s how it is. It’s right and I’m happy.

What if we got rid of school's grading system and changed it to a money making system?,"Here me out.....


With AI and tech advancing as it is a lot of people will be automated out of a job. I imagine when that becomes a reality some sort universal basic income will be around but what incentive do people have to work or to improve themselves (other than common consumerism stuff)?

So instead of schools having a grading system, why not have when kids start high school they are given a lump sum of money. Not enough to do anything substantial with it but enough that gets them to learn the value of a $.  The further in education a kid goes the more $$ they get. So instead of getting an A in their freshman year they get $250, a B returns $175, etc. Sophomore year the amount returned for getting grades goes up, etc etc. PHD’s will return $thousands$.

Maybe I should have posted this is showerthoughts but I’m curious to hear what other people think about this.

He never announced openly or publicly in any way that he had cancer; he only told his girlfriend and me at first, and he asked that we didn’t say anything because he didn’t want anyone feeling sorry for him. Most of our family, and his friends and co-workers only found out when he’d mention it casually when asked why he decided to go bald lol.

Today I got the car I always dreamed of having.,"I’ve been saving up for a couple months to buy my first car, roughly $750 dollars before I had to stop working to go back to school. I knew it wasn’t enough even though I wanted a cheap car (early 2000’s Honda Civic), although it wasn’t my dream car it would be reliable and last me a long time. But growing up I loved my dad’s Jeep Wrangler, I’m unsure of the exact year but it’s from the 90s. I looked like a monster truck to little me because it was raised up, and I wanted it to be my first car.

Eventually it wasn’t a viable car for my dad to keep around, and sold it. I was sad but I knew it was the best option because it wasn’t getting much use. But today my dad came home from work and started asking about dream cars. Asked what I want my first car to be; Honda Civic. Asked what my dream car is; 1967 Cadillac DeVille. Joked around about the Cadillac for a few minutes before he brought up the Wrangler. I said how I loved that car but he had sold it so I figured it was out of the question.

Turns out the person he sold it to, he was a friend of a friend and never really kept in touch, had gotten in contact with him. He had only drove the Wrangler a handful of times before he let it sit. He wanted to give it back to my dad, for free. It runs fine but needs some repairs, repairs that I have the money for. In a couple days it’ll end up back at my house and I can start fixing back up to how I remember it.

I’m so excited. I’d never thought I’d see this car again let alone it come back to me to be my first car. I’m like a kid on Christmas Eve, I’m too excited to sleep.

"I don’t know who needs to hear this, but if classes are hard for you, keep trying. Fight the good fight, and trust in the learning curve.","Well, I do know who needs to hear it, actually. Me.

My classes for this semester just started, and I may have bitten off more than I can chew. Everything is difficult, and even though I have the pre-requisite courses, I still feel like I don’t understand the material. 

I’ve reached out to my professors for help, spent hours pouring over textbooks, still not understanding. Right now, I’m struggling to understand page 8 of my textbook. 8!

I feel stupid, like I’m a failure, like I’ll never understand and I should just drop my classes and change my major.

But we all face a wall like this eventually— and it’s important to remember that as long as you’re determined to succeed, you will. It might take *more* hours of studying, more help from your professors. It might take help from a different source entirely. But, as long as you keep working at it, you will get better.

Fight the good fight, fellow students. Don’t give up. And if you want to vent, share what class is eating you up. 

For me, it’s Ordinary Differential Equations. My professor is very frustrating— if I have a question on something in the class, he might just refuse to answer it because “I should know this already.” Or he likes to tell me to rewatch the lecture when it’s over, as if listening to the same confusing thing is going to magically make me understand.",Squishiimuffin,6,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/CasualConversation/comments/ilgz7r/i_dont_know_who_needs_to_hear_this_but_if_classes/,well know need hear actually class semester started may bitten chew everything difficult even though pre requisite course still feel like understand material reached professor help spent hour pouring textbook still understanding right struggling understand page 8 textbook 8 feel stupid like failure like never understand drop class change major face wall like eventually important remember long determined succeed might take hour studying help professor might take help different source entirely long keep working get better fight good fight fellow student give want vent share class eating ordinary differential equation professor frustrating question something class might refuse answer know already like tell rewatch lecture listening confusing thing going magically make understand,know need hear class hard keep trying fight good fight trust learning curve,squish ii muffin

"What do you think about tests and theories that ""determine"" your personality?","Recently, I learned about the ""Blood Type Personality Theory."" In short, it is a very popular pseudoscientific theory that basically means that your blood type determines your personality. It may seem strange to you if, like me, had never heard of this before. But it's actually not that strange because the Internet loves ""determining"" your personality. So here is a casual read about some of these personality tests, theories, and beliefs.

First off, just look at BuzzFeed. There are so many quizzes that can tell you what Disney Princess you are, or your favorite food will determine what personality you have. There is no science behind any of this, but that's not really necessary because it's just a fun little quiz to entertain you. You can agree or disagree with the result and share it with your friends. And if you get a result you don't like, it doesn't;t matter because you be whatever princess you want to be.

Now moving on to something a little more serious, Hogwarts Houses. Now, if you've never read the books or watched the movies or do anything Harry Potter related, you might not care about your Hogwarts House. But when it comes to those in the HP fanbase, your House is very important to your identity. And because the Houses are not really created equal, so most would want to be a Gryffindor or Ravenclaw, therefore causing some Houses to be ""better"" than others. People who don't really bother with taking the quiz, will probably ask ""Why do you care anyway?"" But to those who find Harry Potter to be something they hold close to their heart, their House is something important to their identity and personality.

If you have never taken a BuzzFeed quiz or the Sorting Hat quiz, all of this may seem like little things that don't have any impact on people's lives. But now consider the following: Astrology. There is your sign, your element, your horoscope, your love compatibility, and Mercury in retrograde. If I were to compare all of this to board games, BuzzFeed quizzes would be checkers, and Astrology would be fucking 4D chess or something.

And astrology is a worldwide thing. For example, [Astrology.com](https://astrology.com/) alone provides ""daily horoscopes, online tarot readings, psychic readings, Chinese *astrology*, Vedic *Astrology*, Mayan *Astrology*, Numerology, etc."" Cultures all over the world seem to think that your personality is determined by fate or the occult, or some divine celestial objects can predict the future.

Now, this isn't to hate on astrology; rather, I was amazed at how many different forms of it all over the place. Also, you might find yourself to believe in some form of astrology or something similar.  
But another question is, what does BuzzFeed and Hogwarts Houses have anything to do with it. The thing is, while they may seem like they have no connection (my checkers to 4D chess comparison) they are actually quite similar when you consider this: They all ""determine"" your personality.

Of course, they all do so in different ways. You can just take a few minutes to answer questions that tell you what personality you have. It's really straightforward because the questions basically ask you what personality you have. On the other hand, other personalities determining methods are predetermined. You are born on a certain month, or a certain year, you have a certain blood type, etc.

Let's use the blood type personality theory as an example since it started this whole post. I'll compare it to Hogwarts Houses to show how they are similar.

The blood types are A, B, O, and AB, and their traits are as follows: As are well-organized, Bs are selfish, Os are optimistic, and ABs are eccentric. Compare this to the four Hogwarts Houses: Gryffindor, Ravenclaw, Slytherin, and Hufflepuff. Gryffindors are brave, Ravenclaws are smart, Slytherins are cunning, and Hufflepuffs are loyal. In the same way each blood-type has certain traits and quirks, so do Hogwarts Houses. 

But there is something they have in common that isn't so pleasant. While Hogwarts Houses is something J.K. Rowling came up with and wrote down on an aeroplane sick bag, it has become and important part of the fanbase. If you claim to be a HP fan but don't know your house, you're probably not a HP fan. 

On the other hand, Masahiko Nomi published papers in the 1970s that revived this theory originally published by Takeji Furukawa. Today, it is extremely popular in places like  Japan, South Korea, and Taiwan. There are magazines, newspapers and television shows that feature horoscopes and relationship compatibilities. It is such an important aspect of the culture. And regardless of whether you believe in it or not, as long as it is talked about, its popularity and impact will increase. 

But while both Hogwarts Houses and Blood Type Theory have some similarities, the thing that really connects the two is how they both have negative types. Sure, whether a specific trait is a good thing or a bad thing is subjective. But the majority of people don't think that. If you're a Slytherin, you're in the same house as Voldemort so you're basically a evil, murderous villain. 

The exact same thing happens with blood types. While blood type B has positive traits, people focus on how the negative traits outweigh the good ones, so people with blood type B are seen as selfish.

What is worse is that while you can lie about what house you got on the quiz, your blood-type is not something you choose. Not only that, not only can it impact a person's social life, it can affect one's career because job recruitment and school entrance exams have asked for people's blood types in applications.

The main takeaway for me from all this is that people care a lot about personality and identity than they would like to admit. It is all trivial things that don't have a scientific basis or anything to back it up, but they become so popular because it's so easy to categorize people that way. And I guess I wasn't satisfied with it. If we categorize people the same way you categorize Pokemon by type, is any person truly unique and special, and do their traits and personality actually matter anymore?

And if people still think the impact of categorizing people with labels isn't that big, just look at the some of the issues that plague humanity. We label people by race, sex, gender, religion, etc. When you take differences between people and decide you know what, this group is better than that other group, there is going to arguments and disagreements about it. It can be a little argument on the Internet but once it happens in the real world via bullying, discrimination, stereotypes, etc., it becomes an issue. And if media portrays differences between people as one is good and one is bad, we don't really take into account a person's actual personality and instead rely on factors that are pre-determined or don't really affect a person's character.

Of course, it's not really fair to compare BuzzFeed quizzes to racism (I won't go to war with you if you are a different Disney Princess) but the point is that we shouldn't take these quizzes or theories too seriously and harass others for being different. We're all different and that's okay. 

All of these quizzes and theories can't really determine exactly what personality you have or predict your future. But it is fine to celebrate our differences. You can say your zodiac sign, Hogwarts House, blood type, etc. with confidence and be proud of your identity. Just remember that we're all humans with unique personalities so a quiz or belief shouldn't determine who you are, *you* determine who you are. 

But that's just what I think. Whether someone agrees or disagrees, it's a chance for me to learn more about all of this stuff.

I imagine a lot of people on Reddit upvote what they agree with but downvote what they disagree with. I do this with posts of course, but with comments I often find I'm downvoting people who are rude, even if I agree with their premise, because they weren't kind/helpful/respectful.

I also upvote things I disagree with if I feel the comment was informative and helped me understand the alternative perspective better in a kind manner.

I'm not sure if this is ""not the purpose of voting"", but I feel like people deserve to be acknowledged for being kind and helpful even if I disagree with them. Even if it is just with fake Internet points 🙂

Occasionally I'll even refrain from voting on a comment if I'm unsure of what tone the writer intended. Just don't feel comfortable doing it! What if they are being a jerk?

Do you guys find yourselves voting like this?

The Person,"As a teenager, I tried to be popular by doing the things that the cool kids did. I didn't get what I wanted which was popularity. But that one year of trying to be popular made me learn something - it isn't the thing which really matters, but the person. People wouldn't respect the opinion of who they deem ""lower"" in class, but would respect the same opinion coming from someone with power.  Example: Reddit hates emojis, but when Rick Astley, a huge icon in the meme community, used them, they allowed it, but if someone else did that, they would be downvoted and bullied to hell. 

And what can I say except this is bullshit (imo).",ivegotcashtho,0,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/CasualConversation/comments/ilmweh/the_person/,teenager tried popular thing cool kid get wanted wa popularity one year trying popular made learn something thing really matter person people respect opinion deem lower class would respect opinion coming someone power example reddit hate emojis rick astley huge icon meme community used allowed someone else would downvoted bullied hell say except bullshit imo,person,ive got cash tho
Saw a family of turkeys on my drive in the suburbs today and it brought up some emotions,"I’m lucky to see a family of ducks walking around. In my area its actually more common to see a family of deer. And when I say family, I mean there was a momma turkey leading three or four baby turkeys across the street during rush hour. I saw the person in front of me waving them across during a red light and it just filled me with so much joy; I’d only ever seen a wild turkey maybe one other time. 

A few years ago, I was living in Boston and was woken up at 7 am by an unmistakable—surreal—gobble gobbling. The gentle morning sunrise glistened through my dew ridden window, as I peeled the curtain open and laid eyes on the plumpest Thanksgiving posterfowl, galavanting down a main street sidewalk. Oddly enough, there were a few other people already out at the time and they just kept walking, taking no notice. They had to have heard it, as the only sounds that morning were a gobble, a glub, and the light tick tacking of fragile, bony feet, progressing across city cement. The turkey was just another pedestrian, whistling to itself during its morning commute.

Something about turkeys is almost mythical to me. Seeing wild ones makes me imagine a time when the Northern US was a vastly wooded area without shopping centers or office buildings. We eat turkey so often in unnatural processed ways, its easy to forget how long they’ve been in this country—before even the first American settlers. I wanted to get out of my car today and ask the family questions about the first Thanksgiving; what the great Native American tribes were like before colonization. 

I read that wild turkeys are back on the rise in North America, and I’d really like that. Seeing even one in my suburban area is rare; seeing a mother with her turkey babies, proudly exploring the land of their ancestors, evoked emotions that I’m sure mimicked the sensation of stumbling across several unicorns, communing next to a pot of gold.  

Apparently they’re invasive over in California but I mean. They’re cool. Like a walking time capsule.",drowner200,0,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/CasualConversation/comments/ilkwip/saw_a_family_of_turkeys_on_my_drive_in_the/,lucky see family duck walking around area actually common see family deer say family mean wa momma turkey leading three four baby turkey across street rush hour saw person front waving across red light filled much joy ever seen wild turkey maybe one time year ago wa living boston wa woken 7 unmistakable surreal gobble gobbling gentle morning sunrise glistened dew ridden window peeled curtain open laid eye plumpest thanksgiving posterfowl galavanting main street sidewalk oddly enough people already time kept walking taking notice heard sound morning gobble glub light tick tacking fragile bony foot progressing across city cement turkey wa another pedestrian whistling morning commute something turkey almost mythical seeing wild one make imagine time northern u wa vastly wooded area without shopping center office building eat turkey often unnatural processed way easy forget long country even first american settler wanted get car today ask family question first thanksgiving great native american tribe like colonization read wild turkey back rise north america really like seeing even one suburban area rare seeing mother turkey baby proudly exploring land ancestor evoked emotion sure mimicked sensation stumbling across several unicorn communing next pot gold apparently invasive california mean cool like walking time capsule,saw family turkey drive suburb today brought emotion,dr owner 200
"I finally ""love"" myself","I know, I might be venting a little but I needed some place to talk about this cuz it's really important for me.

For context, I used to be extremely depressed and anxious about myself in any way. I felt bad about anything I did and needed someone's appreciation just to feel the slightest positive emotion. I've wanted to die for the past about 9 years and I am just 17.
I can't really tell you what happened, at the beginning of this year everything seemed to shatter but it all went out as well as it could be. Early this year could easily been the worst time of my life but I guess this built me up. It just randomly clicked, I felt like I was a totally different person. I smiled more, I talked more, I saw things in an optimistic but not naive way. My inner desires what I want to do finally overcame my desire to be with somebody else. I realised that I am rather a sunshine full of positive vibes rather than a person always in a bad mood. 
The time where I was forced to be on my own has shown me how important it is to do the things you love because these things will last you. I am finally putting an effort to improve myself physically and mentally. I am now willing to learn new things. I built my first PCs and now I want to start learning new languages (Italian and French +improving my Spanish) and want to learn how to fix cars. It's such a big relief finally living for myself and not for anybody else.

I have a GREAT job opportunity but I am not sure if I must take it.,"Background: I work as a programmer in my father's company. It's a really small company.   
I am safe and confortable here and I also know that my only way to grow up, earn more money, is working harder and seeking more customers for us.

I got an indication to work in a multinacional company. It's really a great opportunity for my carrer, but with great powers....  
More money, more benefits(awesome health plan for example), a well defined path to growth inside the company, but much more work aswell. I am kinda lazy and I like to do things in my own time. For example, today I watched anime half of the day cause I have no close deadline coming and I can always do my job at any time, like If I want to work at midnight I can.  
I won't be my ""own boss"" anymore. I will have much more responsability and I'll be in charge of people and also being charged, like all the time.   
That's a HUGE change in my life. I am afraid as hell.  
The job isn't mine yet, but I have a pretty good chance, considering a guy is indicating me. If I start at that job and doesn't go on, the company will blame him, and I don't want that, he is a friend of mine.  
I don't know that to do, omg.

"Played fall guys for a couple days, and I've never felt so neutral about playing anything","Maybe I'm just tired, or I've gotten jaded about it... But I lose a round of fall guys, I feel nothing. I win a round, I feel nothing.

It's not like that with Tetris 99; I get pumped trying to improve, mad at missed block opportunities, psyched at winning or doing a sweet move. Even when there's luck involved in block choice or garbage being sent, it feels like enough skill that strategy and play is overwhelmingly part of adding to the outcome.

I just don't feel that with Fall Guys. It's almost entirely luck, or otherwise other people just suck the fun out of it by pushing (sometimes pulling) you and preventing platforming opportunities. Or worse, some guy starts flying around to the goal line. It's gotten to the point where any victory or defeat feels hollow.

I can't even feel enough to dislike it, because I do see the charm and fun. Nostalgia for Most Extreme Elimination Challenge, and the detail of textures (look at the gym mat plastic corner bunching on the platforms) they're joyful. And the music is banging.

Getting over a lost friendship,"Well, I've been friends with this girl since we were 8, but after High School ended, I moved to another city [not that far tho] and went to a different college, we suddenly started to grow apart.

In senior year of High School, she demonstrated to be unconfortable that I was getting close to my other friend, but I never thought she would ghost me like this. We didn't even fight or anything, and I did try to talk to her about this distance between us, but she said that nothing was going on, that was the last time we actually spoke.

I wish more people had the confidence to say their work is complete and finalized.,"I feel like I have seen an increase in people posting pictures or videos of incredibly well-made artworks or DIY projects or house cleaning before-and-after pictures, always with the caption of something like, ""It's not finished but..."" or ""It's a work in progress"". 

I feel like very few people truly post something that is half-finished, so by giving these posts captions like that, they're simply trying to protect themselves against people who have criticism to give.

""That doesn't look good at all!"" 

""Well, I'm not done with it, so it'll look way better when I'm done"". 

I wish that people could have the confidence to say, ""I made this and I'm proud of it"".

I have been having weird dreams lately. I Wonder if its my subconscious warning me about my mental health.,"I had the weirdest dream ever. I won't go into details but these are things I saw in my dream that were weird-
1)My mom in real life is a very faithful woman but in my dream I saw her flirt with other men and my dad even though noticed It, he didnt say anything.
2) I witnessed my father fall off a cliff by accident. (I felt so helpless at that moment)
3) my sister without a second thought jumped after him. (I was shocked)
4) I hesitated and ended up passed out from seeing this (in my dream) and then in that state. I hear my dads voice asking me let go and jump. So next thing I remember is that I'm falling. (I felt ashamed of myself because my sister didn't hesitate for a second but I did. I didnt want to jump tbh)
5) I'm dead and then I get wings and my father, me and my sister, we are united and I ask dad about my mom and my dad says she lives, we are dead. Its time you let her go. She can live on her own.

"I need to see a dentist, but I'm too afraid to do it. What would you do?","Last year I chipped a tooth, and it has been bothering me. I haven't chewed on that side since.

I know I have to see a dentist, and I want to fix this, but problem is I'm too afraid to do it. And I know the more I wait the worse it is.

I'd look up reviews to choose a place, but that's not a thing here. It's word of mouth that spreads that kind of info around here and I couldn't find any place without horror stories. May no mistake, the pain doesn't scare me, I endure lots of pain regularly by the laws of nature and the chipped tooth also hasn't been nice. It's what could go wrong that scares me

Everyone I know or talked to went in and had to go to a second place to fix what the first screw up.

Mom had her front teeth scraped by her dentist so she would go back and fix that, she went to other place. Dad had to get a tooth out, the dentist broke it and left pieces inside that got infected and kept insisting that nothing was wrong, after days of agonizing pain dad managed to find another dentist that would intervine in other one's work and that found and got the pieces out. My grandma had emergency surgery because her dentist didn't sterilize his tools properly, got a very bad infection and now she can't swim. Classmate had to replace three teeth after her dentist drilled in them accidentally.

I myself as a kid almost got all my lower front teeth removed (the permanent ones). And it's all different people I'm talking. Person A praises dentist X, and then person B says what happened to them there and that they instead recommend dentist Y, but that's where person A got problems fixed by X.

It goes round like circles. I don't know what to do.

I just want to take a second to appreciate how far the Internet has come.,"Don't get me wrong, things aren't perfect and we're still in a bit of an odd period. But there was a time where you couldn't trust anybody at all online and even giving your name was seen as incredibly sketchy. I believe in privacy, but I've also found that more often then not a majority of people are just around sharing their interests in pockets and doing really cool things.

I think it's amazing that on Reddit for example, peer-to-peer hobby marketplaces like r/hardwareswap and r/mechmarket exist where people regularly sell parts to each other safely without any additional escrow. People are just around enjoying their hobbies and honestly helping each other out (partially because it's simpler as well.)

I think that this age of people opening up more and being friendly about hobbies from knitting to enthusiast audiophiles is really special, and despite the problems and changes over the years, I'm really happy we have the internet.",-Caramel-,1,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/CasualConversation/comments/ilez5b/i_just_want_to_take_a_second_to_appreciate_how/,get wrong thing perfect still bit odd period wa time trust anybody online even giving name wa seen incredibly sketchy believe privacy also found often majority people around sharing interest pocket really cool thing think amazing reddit example peer peer hobby marketplace like r hardwareswap r mechmarket exist people regularly sell part safely without additional escrow people around enjoying hobby honestly helping partially simpler well think age people opening friendly hobby knitting enthusiast audiophiles really special despite problem change year really happy internet,want take second appreciate far internet ha come,caramel

I felt free for the first time in years,"This all happened about a month ago, but it came back to my mind and I wanted to share it.

At the end of July I finished studying, and had to spend two days in a different city (almost 100 km away) for the exams. 

Even though I'm friendly with all of them, I didn't really bond with any of my classmates, so I ended up spending most of those two days alone, but it was a blessing in disguise.


I woke up early in the morning and drove all the way there, looking at a beautiful morning sky and listening to music.

On the first evening I bought myself some cookies I always wanted to try, then spent a couple hours on the swings in a local park; after it closed I walked to a nearby square and found it full of children playing, so I stayed there a little, offering them cookies and retrieving their ball from time to time.

After this, I was already feeling like I finally had a choice in my life. Quarantine really took a toll on me, even though I'm always at home I hated being denied the ability to go out.


On the second day we all finished with our exams and they told us whether we passed or not; we said goodbye to each other, there were hand shakes, high fives, pats on the shoulder and so on.

Everyone got on their car and drove away; I was the last one to leave. I was thinking of how a big chunk of my life had ended right there; I would no longer be studying, I would never see all those people again, and I would be starting to work in a few weeks.

I started driving back home, when on the GPS I noticed I would be passing through the town where a friend of mine lived. I thought about it for a bit, how we see each other rarely because of the distance, then said screw it, pulled over and called my friend; I asked him if he was free for dinner and he said yes.

We spent the evening together, we got pizza, wandered around the town centre, then went back to his house and sit outside under the porch just talking; when I came back home it was 2:30 am and I had never been so happy before.


It really felt like I had my life in my own hands, I could actually do whatever I wanted, I could finally do whatever came to my mind without having to ask permission or fear being mocked about it.

This is something I have always struggled with, I got my driving licence late, didn't have a car of my own and lived in a small town, so I was always somewhat limited in the places I could visit on a whim; these two days were a taste of what my dream life looked like, and from now on I'll work hard to make it real.",killer_kupcake,2,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/CasualConversation/comments/il3baj/i_felt_free_for_the_first_time_in_years/,happened month ago came back mind wanted share end july finished studying spend two day different city almost 100 km away exam even though friendly really bond classmate ended spending two day alone wa blessing disguise woke early morning drove way looking beautiful morning sky listening music first evening bought cooky always wanted try spent couple hour swing local park closed walked nearby square found full child playing stayed little offering cooky retrieving ball time time wa already feeling like finally choice life quarantine really took toll even though always home hated denied ability go second day finished exam told u whether passed said goodbye hand shake high five pat shoulder everyone got car drove away wa last one leave wa thinking big chunk life ended right would longer studying would never see people would starting work week started driving back home gps noticed would passing town friend mine lived thought bit see rarely distance said screw pulled called friend asked wa free dinner said yes spent evening together got pizza wandered around town centre went back house sit outside porch talking came back home wa 2 30 never happy really felt like life hand could actually whatever wanted could finally whatever came mind without ask permission fear mocked something always struggled got driving licence late car lived small town wa always somewhat limited place could visit whim two day taste dream life looked like work hard make real,felt free first time year,killer k cake
Happy Reminder To Talk To People.,"Since quarantine, I haven’t spoke to many people, neither in real life or through texting and I mostly just talked to my family (and people in Animal Crossing), so 3 days ago I decided to ask my best friend if she wanted to hang out.

She didn’t reply until a day later (not unusual for her so I thought nothing of it), and we agreed to meet up on the 2nd of September, Today, the texts were nothing unusual, just us talking about how we missed each other, we hadn’t met up since December (we planned on meeting in March to give each other our birthday presents, obviously that got cancelled), so I was pretty excited, I got her present wrapped several months too late, and she arrived.

We hung out like normal, laughing, joking, sharing gossip, she was smiling, we played Mario Kart and Party, went shopping, all the usual. Then about 5 minutes before she heads off, she says thanks, she really needed this, because her Grandad died the day I texted her, and she just needed someone to talk to for more than just sympathy, I had no idea, but reminded her that I’ll always be here for her.

Can't find my wallet,"Have you ever ""lost"" a wallet, but you feel like it's not really lost, it's just somewhere where you can't find it. I can trace my steps back. And I think it is probably somewhere in my car or in my house... yet I can't find it. 

I went through a drive through on Monday, then went home, then to a park at night. But when I go to the park I usually do not take my wallet with me (leave it home or in car). But my car was locked so I doubt it was stolen. Next day I was home all day with my kid. And then around 5pm I simply could not find it. 

Maybe it fell out of my car while I was exiting? 

Maybe my kid hit it somewhere (I asked and he denied); he's 6 and he has done this before.

Maybe it's just in some obvious spot and I am completely overlooking it. 

Maybe it fell into the trash or a clothes hamper? 

I checked my bank account and credit card accounts and there's nothing fishy, so probably it's not in the hands of a criminal.

Fingers crossed we get permission to get a kitten!,"Tomorrow is our next rental inspection. They love us, we've been here nearly 3yrs and our land agent only ever has praise for how neat and tidy the place is kept. We've even mulched the garden for the owner at our own suggestion. Tomorrow we're finally going to ask if we can get our daughter her first kitten. The lease says ""no pets"" so we have to ask, but I'm cautiously optimistic that we've proved we can keep a clean house and be respectful of the property. I can't sleep because I'm so anxious to hear what he decides! I haven't had a kitten in about 20 years, and no pets at all for the last 4. My daughter would just flip out at the idea of getting a kitten now. It will be ok if he says no, but I really hope he doesn't.

I can't wait! Just had to share that with someone lol, maybe now I can get to sleep. Wish us luck!!

Does your mindset ever recover from bullying?,"I (29,M) think I took a longer than normal amount of time to learn how to function with other kids effectively. As an elementary student or younger, the way I perceived my relationships with other kids was either that they didn’t want to play with me, or that they just wanted to make fun of me or pick on me. I felt like my entire class of students would bully me, often very much a 20 vs 1 situation it felt like.. (for being fat, bad at sports, ugly.. those were the main themes).. and over time as we went through 5th grade, onto middle and high school, these treatments faded and I developed some good friendships. Life was pretty normal from then on, even having a normal dating life, slimming down, and becoming a college athlete. Since college ended I’ve had a lot of professional success too, having moved from my home town to NYC where I’m living a good life, and I’m aware I have a lot to be grateful for. Still though, I feel like two aspects of who I am as a person remain from being “bullied” as a kid: 

1. I’m very shy around people I don’t know, even avoiding eye contact and I have trouble making conversations.

(And here is the reason for my post)
2. Decades later, I feel a residual amount of pleasure when someone I don’t generally care for is in emotional distress. 

Today I saw a video of a pregnant Australian woman being arrested for trying to organize a demonstration despite currently in-force laws against congregating. You may have seen the video, it’s making the rounds. She is arrested in front of her two kids, is currently pregnant and is going to miss an ultrasound appointment by being arrested, and all of the home electronics were seized by a search warrant. She has a breakdown, and is completely desperate not to be arrested. My reaction was.. satisfaction. I was a little happy to see her so miserable in such a complicated situation. 

So I questioned myself, realizing that I feel this satisfaction somewhat often when I see someone I don’t care for (be they annoying, or maybe I find their views problematic.. whatever the reason) in a distressing situation. I don’t want to be someone who feels joy at another person’s distress. Does anyone think that my innate joy in these moments is related to seeing people feel as badly as I used to feel as a bullied child? That was my only hypothesis to why I have this tendency at all.

If this is related to bully-trauma, have any of you experienced this and fully recovered from your own “bully-trauma”?",jjthejetblame,3,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/CasualConversation/comments/ilc1f1/does_your_mindset_ever_recover_from_bullying/,29 think took longer normal amount time learn function kid effectively elementary student younger way perceived relationship kid wa either want play wanted make fun pick felt like entire class student would bully often much 20 v 1 situation felt like fat bad sport ugly main theme time went 5th grade onto middle high school treatment faded developed good friendship life wa pretty normal even normal dating life slimming becoming college athlete since college ended lot professional success moved home town nyc living good life aware lot grateful still though feel like two aspect person remain bullied kid 1 shy around people know even avoiding eye contact trouble making conversation reason post 2 decade later feel residual amount pleasure someone generally care emotional distress today saw video pregnant australian woman arrested trying organize demonstration despite currently force law congregating may seen video making round arrested front two kid currently pregnant going miss ultrasound appointment arrested home electronics seized search warrant ha breakdown completely desperate arrested reaction wa satisfaction wa little happy see miserable complicated situation questioned realizing feel satisfaction somewhat often see someone care annoying maybe find view problematic whatever reason distressing situation want someone feel joy another person distress doe anyone think innate joy moment related seeing people feel badly used feel bullied child wa hypothesis tendency related bully trauma experienced fully recovered bully trauma,doe mindset ever recover bullying,jj jet blame

Herbal Teas Bleugh,"I just tried drinking Rosemary tea, and 🤮 that tastes awful (even with sugar in it)

And a while back I tried some Turmeric tea and bleugh too

Why do they taste awful? How do people even drink them? 🤨

Update: After 3 hours the aftertaste of this tea isn't gone yet (Even though I only took 2 sips and drained the rest) 
I've tried:
-Water
-Pineapple Juice
-A spoon of vinegar
-A few grapes
-Half a lemon (directly)
-Some coco cereal
-A cup of milk

Have you ever changed the name you call someone?,"For years I've had a friend. Let's call him Andy Brown.

We've called him Brownie the whole time I've known him, because there are multiple Andys in the group of friends.

Except Brownie has now become my boyfriend, and it's starting to feel weird calling him Brownie, because it's such a pal-ly, platonic friend, dude-bro way of calling someone. But it also feels weird to call him Andy because I never really have, unless I'm joking around with him.

Also, his friends from other areas in his life like college or work call him Andy, and when I'm with them I'm the only one who calls him Brownie. And when I meet his family I can't call him Brownie because... well... they're all Browns, and they all call him Andy. You know?

How could someone not want to always learn more?,"I absolutely love learning. I love educating myself on new topics or topics that need some brushing up. I often wish college were free solely because I have so many subjects I wish I could properly delve into, but can’t because it would cost me a lifetime or 6 in debt. 

I can’t understand how someone wouldn’t always want to learn more. I see so many people content with being ignorant to life and how things work, and it’s just so odd to me.

And trust me, I’m fully aware ignorance is bliss. Being smart can be rough sometimes, but I’m still grateful for the power of knowledge and all of the good that it can bring. 

I also understand some people do not have the resources or the ability to educate themselves, but again, that does not mean they still don’t have the desire to learn something. That, there, is what I’m getting at. When I learn something new it’s rewarding and is often times useful. I wish everyone understood that. 

Cite those sources, back your science teachers, read up on world history, look into astronomy, architecture, physiology, whatever your mind can think of! There is a vast wonderland of knowledge out there, find credible sources of information and just immerse yourself. It’s a beautiful feeling.

How often do friends lie about their salaries?,"I’m having a bit of FOMO or grass is greener on the other side mentality

&amp;#x200B;

I am 29 years old and make around $65k as a project manager at a software company. I’m good with my salary and it affords me the lifestyle I want. I’m able and have been able to reach savings goals for milestone items like house, car, vacations, etc. 

&amp;#x200B;

I have friends who are my age who, when we talk about salary, I feel that they are deceitfully one-upping me. Often times I don’t disclose what I make because I hate getting into piss contests over it. Nurses, PCAs, social workers, a lot of jobs that traditionally don’t make more than $65k are telling me they make significantly more than that, when they've only been in the job 3-5 years. Some throw in that they put in overtime or other bonuses. But still, you can research on indeed and Glassdoor and find the average salary and it’s never what they’re saying. So I’m often skeptical. We live in a far out suburb of MN where the cost of living is decently low. 

&amp;#x200B;

Then to top it off my brother and sister who are both sales reps at different software companies tell me that they make $150k a year and they’re both a few years younger than me, decently new in their roles. They make it sound like they struck gold mines and barely have to work. This is where I’m starting to get frustrated. Either everyone is somehow making a shit ton more than they deserve, or everyone is lying to me. 

&amp;#x200B;

I’ve researched Glassdoor and the average sales rep salaries for their companies are about half of what they’re saying with commission. Are they trying to tell me that they’re that much above average? 

&amp;#x200B;

So my ask is; do people lie about their salaries this often? It’s what I’ve been telling myself, but I also don’t want to kid myself. I simply just value truth and above any feelings, I just don't want people close to me lying to me. I want to simply be happy for them while simultaneously letting it motivate me. But I just can’t shake the idea that many are lying. ",DistractedIdealist,8,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/CasualConversation/comments/ilddcn/how_often_do_friends_lie_about_their_salaries/,bit fomo grass greener side mentality amp x200b 29 year old make around 65k project manager software company good salary affords lifestyle want able able reach saving goal milestone item like house car vacation etc amp x200b friend age talk salary feel deceitfully one upping often time disclose make hate getting piss contest nurse pcas social worker lot job traditionally make 65k telling make significantly job 3 5 year throw put overtime bonus still research indeed glassdoor find average salary never saying often skeptical live far suburb mn cost living decently low amp x200b top brother sister sale rep different software company tell make 150k year year younger decently new role make sound like struck gold mine barely work starting get frustrated either everyone somehow making shit ton deserve everyone lying amp x200b researched glassdoor average sale rep salary company half saying commission trying tell much average amp x200b ask people lie salary often telling also want kid simply value truth feeling want people close lying want simply happy simultaneously letting motivate shake idea many lying,often friend lie salary,distracted idealist

My neighbor thought he uncovered a secret feature in our house.,"I've been wanting to write down this memory for a while, and I didn't know where else it would fit.

This happened when I was a teenager in the pre-internet days of the early 1990s. It wasn't as easy to learn how to do simple fixes or house repairs as it is today. There were no YouTube video tutorials. If your furnace was acting up, you payed someone to come look at it, or you first asked a friend or neighbor who might know how to fix it. One day my mom saw our neighbor outside and mentioned some issue we were having with the furnace. He offered to take a look.

My neighbor was an old man with a lot of wild opinions, which were easier to ignore back then. The three of us went into the basement, and hovered around the furnace. My mother flipped the main breaker before he started poking around.

The night before, someone must have paused the CD player instead of turning it off, because when we flipped the breaker back on, we heard a woman's voice loud and clear, announce:

&gt;*Señores y señoras,  
&gt;
&gt;Nosotros tenemos más influencia con sus hijos que tu tiene.  
&gt;
&gt;Pero los queremos…*  

My neighbor stood mystified, looked around in wonder, and gasped, **""Amaaaaazing!""** as if our house was secretly fitted with some kind of futuristic, Spanish-speaking Star Trek computer, and he had somehow activated it through the furnace. My mother had no clue what was happening.

I watched in amusement, wishing my brothers were also there to witness this moment.

&gt;*Creado y regado de Los Angeles*

I accidentally almost injured my dog and even though nothing at all happens I feel bad,"Hi there, 

important things first: nothing at all happened. It's just the thought of ""it could have happened"" that's driving me insane.

So I was mowing the lawn and my dog just likes to hang around and watch me or enjoy the sun while I do so.

I always thoroughly check the lawn for sticks and leftover bones first - dog owners will know ^^

but today I missed a small piece of bone that she must have left, very well hidden on the lawn, yesterday.

as I mowed over it, it shot out from underneath the mower and missed her head by no more than just a couple of inches before it literally bounced of a wall and almost hit her from behind as well.

I immediately checked she didn't get hit by it.
she's fine. it missed her. she was actually quite excited (after the inicial shock), started looking all over for that piece of bone and was proud and happy as, when she found it.

but all that was and is on my mind is: what if it would have hit her? that thing was like a bullet. I would have never been able to forgive myself.

In my mind it actually replays as if it was hitting her. It is as if my brain just won't ever even believe how lucky we just were.

anyway, she might have to stay inside from now on whenever I mow the lawn. It's probably safer in general.

For autistic people being in a partnership or a relationship will often become like a special interest or addiction, a focuse point, they put all their energy into, and I did that, with a man who was abusive. Spend a year isolated and controlled, because I let him rule me, while I just did everything I could to not give him reason to be paranoid over me cheating on him (which I ofcourse never did, for I am loyal to the core) but this loyalty made me go so far with it, it ruined my life. Took a year for me to get out of it. And I ofcourse imagined this show was going to be light hearted and fun, talking about awkward romance, but giving hopes for the future.

I know how easily now I can be controlled, and so I have very high expectations of my next partner, they need to be very special - or else I rather not have anyone at all. And so, I said no to take part in this show. But we kept talking, and he eventually says he'd love it if I did a little video talking about romance, keeping all my horror stories of my past out of it. I knew this would mean I'd join the project, but screw it. I was already into it. So I did the video. He looved it. Send it to his producer. Now later today I'm getting a phonecall from some one from the tv channel to interview me. I am just going to go along with it, makes my day entertaining. Who knows, maybe I'lll end up on tv.

I invested the absolute most I could so that I won't feel any buyer's remorse after the purchase was made. And this was my investment i.e my money and not something my parents bought for me


So about 2 weeks ago my dream was now reality. It was a Ryzen 5 3600 + RTX 2070 Super along with a 28"" 4k monitor . Not really the highest of the highest end but as I said earlier the deepest my pocket could go

The Poof 

Was casually browsing reddit today and saw the prices of the latest 3000 series cards and felt a freaking dagger pierce through my heart. If I had just waited a couple more weeks I could have bought a 3070 card for the price I bought the 2070 card for. Meaning 2 x the performance boost (very roughly) 



I knew the 3000 series was round the corner but never expected them to be soo cheap.

Im Vaping Way Less,"Hi!! 
This is my first time posting here and im really proud of myself and wanted to share. So I started vaping (i know its a bad habit im not looking for lectures) my senior year of high school and im now a sophomore in college. When I started it wasn’t bad, just something to do with friends. But i got more hooked and would even vape in the bathroom at school. Still, it wasnt too bad. However, freshman yr of college when covid hit and i was quarantining at home it got really bad. I have a Novo 2 and i was filling my pod like everyday. That is a LOT of nicotine. I recently moved back to MT where i go to school, and im already almost out of a bottle of juice. For reference, in the same amount of time my boyfriend isnt even halfway done with his. He’s helped me slow down and only take a few hits every hour or so. Before I was taking a few hits every 10-20 mins. I’ve been on the same pod for like three days now! Its still basically full. Im just really proud of myself bc I am not doing myself any favors by vaping but it had gotten really really bad for a few months and I felt terrible. Sorry for the long read, and I know this isnt a huge accomplishment as I still am vaping but I’m happy with my progress. I’m also open to suggestions so I can get less hooked on this and eventually quit. I don’t want to be doing this forever

Was there anything to see in the morning, before 12 pm? I know there were cartoons on Saturday morning but I’m talking about working days. 
I’m pretty sure during weekdays programs started later, but what I’m really after (besides that confirmation) is what was visible on the tv before any program started? Was it just a black screen, or a picture or something?

I Made It!,"I don't think anyone will actually see this, but today, I just had my first orientation session for welcome week for my first year in university! Two years ago, I kind of lost all hope that I would make it into my dream program / university due to a brain injury from a car accident which caused all sorts of problems for me academically. I had a lot of trouble with memory and word finding and  also developed some speech problems. I suffered from a lot anxiety and panic attacks and depressive episodes. I pushed all of my friends away and preferred to be alone and was just in a really dark place overall. It didn't help that one of my teachers believed I was faking my symptoms and told me to just ""get over it"". The required minimum average to be considered for my program was a 92%. Before the accident, I was at high 80s. After the accident, I dropped to high 60s/low 70s. I just gave up at that point.

But I had three friends who stubbornly refused to leave my side, and they kept encouraging me. They gave me the love and support that I needed and would help me with my studies whenever they could. My mom was also very supportive, signing me up for therapy sessions so I would be able to talk to a therapist about my problems since she knew it was hard for me to open up to anybody. She helped me find resources that would help me do better academically and stubbornly fought school's halfhearted attempts to make things better for me and refused to settle for less than what the neuropsychologist recommended.  

It was hard, but I'm proud to say that I graduated my senior year with a 93.4% average and was granted entry into my dream program and my first choice university!

Failed Driver's Sight Test,"I'm one line short of driving.

Hey, new to this sub and hope this type of post is permitted. I (22/f) live in Nova Scotia, Canada, and due to places being open again went to take my beginners drivers test. I had my beginners five years ago, with my eye doctors permission (I can't look through both eyes to make one image due to facial paralysis and my eyes not moving laterally, so the machine at the dmv was a no-go). My regular eye doctor has a very long waiting list, so I scheduled an appointment for a different doctor, expecting to get ok results. The doctor was SO nice about listening to me talk about my rare facial paralysis (Moebius syndrome), and did all the nessasary tests. Lo and behold, my eyes are 20/50, and NS requires an acuity of 20/40 in each eye, or 20/30 and 20/50 in each eye. He was in contact with my previous doctor's office to see their findings, and they were consistant. He was apologetic and said that because my eyes are shaped like lemons instead of oranges (stigmatisim I think) and that they are around a 6 (abnormally high) that the only thing he could think about doing was hard contacts, but that even then it was a long shot. And they aren't fitting those right now because of Corona. I'm not really sure what I'm hoping to hear right now, and I'm sure he went over every possibity, but I'm desperate.

I'm finally getting braces and I am so excited!,"I am 27. I grew up extremely poor and honestly didn't even know what real dental hygiene was until my adult life. 
My adolescence was rittled with cavities, infected teeth
..etc. 
If there was a problem my parents would pretty much just have my teeth extracted. 
I have been practicing great oral hygiene for most of my adult life and haven't had a cavity in many years! 
Unfortunately though some problems from years prior persisted and at this point in my life I've had 3 wisdom teeth removed (1 impacted), 4 additional molars removed, multiple bone grafts, a few root canals...and then some. 
And on top of all this madness, I have always had crooked teeth! 
Some of the good teeth I have have majorly shifted because of other missing teeth and pressure from wisdom teeth. 
I never put much thought into braces growing up because I knew my family couldn't afford it. 
In my adult life I've felt embarrassed of my crooked and missing teeth and thought I wasn't good enough for braces, that it would be a waste of time, or that maybe they wouldn't even be possible for me! 

BUT!

I finally went to a consultation today and I am so proud of myself! 
They assured me that they can help me get my teeth in working order and make my smile perfect! 
I WILL BE GETTING BRACES! FINALLY! 
I know I have a long road ahead of me still but I'm so happy to be making steps in the right direction!

It was a kind of impulse decision but I've had a few weeks to think about it and work out the details, and so its booked for Saturday afternoon! I'm super anxious- I can't do needles, and I'm kind of a pussy when it comes to pain tolerance, but I know I'll be fine. I've never done anything like this before, but I've done so much research. I've found where I want it to go, what I want it to be, where it won't hurt too badly, the size of the tattoo, etc. Every base I could think to cover to ease my anxiety has been covered.

"I, 30 year old Adult Male, still play with toys","These are not collectors. I put some on a shelf but the rest are in a box. I will always have at least 1 toy in my pocket. I am in grad school, married, athletic, and play with toys. I have always loved fiddling with a toy, but its not just something to do with my hands. I have stories for them, act them out. My desk on average has about 6 toys sitting on it at a time. My family and friends have gotten used to it but will still ask why I do it, I don't really have an answer, I just really enjoy it. I barely go longer than an hour without having a toy on me, I feel kind of naked honestly without one. They're small, mostly around the 3 inch range, so you can barely notice it, I will have long conversations with someone while fiddling with a toy and they won't notice unless I make it really obvious. I also just like the feel of a good quality toy in my pocket. 

&amp;#x200B;

Its a mix between pokemon, star wars, and superheros most of the time. Specifically the super hero squad, the dc action league brave and bold, Tomy, Jakks, and Wicked Cool Toys Pokemon. There is a mix of others like Robot heroes versions of transformers, but these are the primary. I know from their make and material which ones are best for what pockets I have, what the weather will be/temperature. I thought I would grow out of it in my early twenties, but its just as strong as ever. I never really enjoyed video games, I don't know if its the lack of getting to touch what's happening or if the story feels restricting, I just love making stories for the toys and having that tactile feel. Some people are fine with it, though I've been dumped over it because it was childish. Maybe 1 or 2 people have been actually fine with it, everyone else seems to tolerate it enough. I know its not normal, but I never feel as though I am hurting someone, The collection in it's entirety fits into 2 shelves, I just wish I didn't have to explain I just like toys each time people notice, because I don't want to have to hide it in my own room. In public I'll just put a hand in a pocket and mess around with a toy but in my office I like having them out and on my desk.

Today I began the process of actualizing “Day One instead of One Day”,"Many months ago on reddit, I came across [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/DoesAnybodyElse/comments/fdno1t/dae_think_super_productive_thoughts_at_night_and/fjir0cl/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf) comment on a post that hit me harder than most things I give myself the chance to read. It had stuck with me for many months even though I have severely struggled to implement this wonderful advice, or any advice, into my life. 

But, today was day one. As I was stewing about in my dark hole of depression, I started crawling my way out while I told myself today was going to be day one.

I worked out for the first time in months, I read my book, and I shaved. It might not be much, but after lurking on this subreddit for a while, it’s the small things like this that seem to make the most difference for people as they make small but powerful and positive steps in the direction towards self love and happiness. 

I struggle to turn my mind off when I am not doing such activities, or any activities, so the more active and busy I stay, I believe the happier and healthier I can be.

"To the person who found my mom’s wallet at Costco today, thank you!","(I’m not sure if this flair should be life stories so to be safe I’ll stick with Just Chatting.)

My mom and I were at Costco today. She sometimes needs one of those “drive-able” shopping carts if her feet hurt from being swollen. Anyway, she sent me on my own to look at computer monitors as she scooted off for laundry detergent. Of course the one time I’m not by her side, it dropped out and she only realized once I caught up to her after searching for my stuff.

She was devastated. She tried to hold back tears but she couldn’t. It’s such a tiny pouch too, a little gold pouch I gave her (It’s actually is part of a bigger purse, but both of us hate large purses). It has her life in it. Credit card, cash, license, and some coins. 

So we re-scooted her path, only to find her shopping list on the floor. I honestly thought the purse would have been there too and someone already ran off with it. But instead, someone placed it on a pallet right there. Didn’t take it, surprisingly nobody else took it, no money was missing, and we didn’t know who to thank. But you know who you are. Thank you.

Anyone out there who’s been in a similar situation? Either the finder or the person who lost something?

"Some kind stranger randomly fixed my trunk (while it was in my driveway) sometime between the time I got home from work and the time I left for work the next day, but didn’t leave a note!","So, I got into a hit and run where someone messed up my bumper and it misaligned my trunk too, so my trunk has been having trouble closing. I’ve basically been trying to MacGyver my trunk closed with different types of clips and bungee chords and different types of ropes, but basically I’ve just broken my license plate cover thing trying to secure it to that because there’s a lot of bumps in the road and because I’m not only disabled (and got denied disability because you always get denied the first time) and I’m getting less than 20 hours a week at my job without getting tips since I’m still considered “training”, I just don’t have the money to get it fixed. It’s been months of having this broken trunk and I’m pretty lucky that I haven’t had any cops pull me over and give me a fix it ticket for it coz it’s popped open On the road before multiple times. I’ve just used the “be confident and hopefully the confidence will make the cops go away”. It’s worked so far. Maybe between the pandemic and the protests and all the other shit, my trunk just isn’t a priority, I don’t know.

Anyways, the other day, I walk outside to go to work and my trunk has been magically fixed! Like, it’s closed and it’s not just closed with a rope and a clip. It’s actually completely closed and fixed and I have no idea who did it or how it happened and they didn’t leave a note and like, I’m so incredibly grateful that I wish they had left a note so I could at least thank them and offer to bake them cookies or something! 

I have cameras out front, so I guess that I could try to see if maybe I could identify the person, but I’ll be honest - I’m a bad neighbor. I don’t know any of my neighbors really. I say hello to my neighbors when I see them, but I couldn’t tell you any of their names despite the fact that the woman and her husband that live across the street and one house to the left have lived there for the last 27 years of my life (and tattle tale on both my mom and me when they see us with men). My neighbor next door is a really hard working immigrant and he’s always very sweet when I see him. He always helps the lady on the corner with her trash cans. But, other than that, I don’t know anyone else, so I wouldn’t even know where to start!

So, this goes out to anyone who has done a good deed (and shown integrity when nobody else was looking). You are appreciated and you are important and you have made someone’s life better and easier and helped someone so much more than you could have ever imagined.

Intense lucid dreams,"The other night, I had a really intense and vivid lucid dream experience that I have only had a handful of times. Not only did I realize I was dreaming, but I decided to actively observe and note what it felt like to be dreaming, take in and try to remember the dream scene, and just generally revel in the fact that I am *currently* in a dream. It's hard to explain, but it was more mindful and intentional than regular lucid dreams.


The scene was a misty, wistful sort of grassland, with soft colors, that stretched out for miles, and was dotted by trees that looked like eucalyptus but were as tall as redwoods.

It's amazing how restaurant and supermarket workers react when you're nice and chatty to them nowadays,"Two days ago I ordered from a restaurant I ordered from twice before, they have a nice chicken and beef shawarma dish with rice and sauce on the side.

The dish is two servings, so it was great value. However, the rice was only enough for half the dish so this time I asked in the notes to add some extra rice and that I'll pay in person (site takes credit cards, and extra rice wasn't on the menu)

When the delivery person arrived he asked how I'm doing and told me the owner says the rice is complimentary. He said the owner knows me for the reviews I write on the website. I only wrote two, but it was cool that he actually acknowledged them and mentioned that he appreciates them to me!

The second instance was earlier today. A friend of mine and I grabbed a breakfast plate from a restaurant he knows. We got to chat with the owner and we talked about all kinds of stuff like his other businesses, how covid affected things, etc. We talked for at least 40 minutes. When we went to pay the lady refused to take our credit card, saying the owner says it's on him this time. My friend goes there a lot, and today they wouldn't let him pay a cent. Saying they also made his meal extra special because he called in to check if they're open earlier.

I noticed that covid is making everyone appreciate a conversation. Every time I go to the grocery store now, at least one or two employees and I talk for a few minutes while I do my shopping. Usually I'm not talkative but it's weird how I feel close to everyone now that we're going through similar hardships.

I finally get to move out.,"I originally had plans to stay in the city I went to college after I graduated. Had a couple of job offers lined up, but as most things in my life happen, they ended up falling through and not working out, forcing me to go back home instead. 

Not too long after graduating, maybe 3 months total, I landed a job 8 miles away from my house. Borderline dream job. Basically work for a mini Google. Insane salary for my position, with all kinds of crazy perks and benefits. I still have to pinch myself sometimes that this is my job, and I've been with them now for a year and a half. 

As most companies have had to do with COVID, we are all working from home right now. Last week, our leadership team came to the conclusion that not only has productivity not declined, but it has actually gotten better for us since we've been working from home. All of our work is done through computers and over the phone, and we really could work wherever we have a stable internet connection. So, knowing that, they made an announcement that we were now allowed to work from home permanently. Not only that, we can even work remote should we decide that we want to move, even if out of state. 

I literally feel like they handed me my official golden ticket. Over 20 years of always catching the short end of the stick. And even when something good happens, it's almost always followed up by crap, and I've never had a string of good happen like this before. 

Being home hasn't been the worst thing in the world. My expenses are minimal, and I've been able to save quite easily, even buying a brand new car and getting it paid off in 10 months. But I was so bummed out about moving out because I knew I'd have to give this job up to do it. Well not anymore, and I couldn't be more excited. I'm not taking off right away, and I want to make sure I've got a great cushion financially before I do, but knowing that it's basically wherever I want to go, and whenever I want to is this crazy feeling of control in my life I've never felt before.

People who wear AFOs... where the heck do you find shoes???,"I (18F) wear an AFO on my right foot due to foot drop caused by my tumor resection surgery in 2017.

I've scoured shoe stores in person and online, but I cant seem to find something that can accommodate my brace and still look cute. I've seen some websites that have creative solutions to create more space in a shoe, but why can't those ideas be used on shoes that I would actually like to wear??

Why do older men wink?,"This is probably going to sound weird to ask lol, but  I’ve noticed that my eye doc has been winking at me for the past month or so on the way out of our room when we finish before he goes onto the next patient’s room.

He’s like 60 I’m guessing, I’m 22 and his youngest patient since he works in a place that does not accept insurance except for Medicare, so he def is used to working with mainly older people. I’m only here bc I was referred to him when I moved. 

Out of the 7 months that I’ve been with him, I’ve literally been at his office like every week for the past month and a half for emergency visits and follow ups bc it’s been just non-stop eye issues with a chronic eye disease that I have, so he’s definitely gotten to know me more. He has complimented me multiple times of  how ‘bright of a young lady’ I am, and entered the room a couple of weeks ago with “hows my favorite patient doing today?” Lmao. Am also a new grad nursing student and he loves being able to think critically with me on things that he wouldn’t be able to do with his other patients. 

He’s extremely professional, super chill and sweet, and I don’t think he’s being flirtatious or anything like that at all, but I was wondering why he’s been winking at me on the way out before going to the next patient’s room.

Turns out people in service industry appreciate being treated like a human being.,"Yes the title makes me sound like a obnoxious arsehole.  But just earlier today I was waiting for servicing of my bike. Despite the servicing centres being always crowded I went in a little late and had to wait for some time. There was a guy behind me, an older person who was whining about how long it was taking them to book a request for a simple servicing. He was standing for less than 4 minutes and already had cut the line and was making everyone rather uncomfortable. I was looking outside and was not paying attention, he cut in front of me and was still whining like he was in a line for ages. When finally it was his turn , he was shouting at the guy who was making entries and asking about vehicle problems. Although he was there for 2 minutes it felt like an eternity to everyone. A few minutes, it was my turn. I approached the guy and said hi how are you (just basic conversation),  the attendant looked at me and was smiling, I couldn't see his face because of his mask but his eyes were smiling too. He asked me wheter I was having any problems or just needed a routine check up. He gave me more time than anyone else. He told me it would take another 2 hours or so before my vehicle servicing can be done. I said no problem and thanked him. Afterwards I was waiting outside the service center, there was another hour to go, the attendant comes up-to me and strikes a conversation. So a little patience gave me a discount and I made a friend. :)",fR1chAps,11,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/CasualConversation/comments/ikewcr/turns_out_people_in_service_industry_appreciate/,yes title make sound like obnoxious arsehole earlier today wa waiting servicing bike despite servicing centre always crowded went little late wait time wa guy behind older person wa whining long wa taking book request simple servicing wa standing le 4 minute already cut line wa making everyone rather uncomfortable wa looking outside wa paying attention cut front wa still whining like wa line age finally wa turn wa shouting guy wa making entry asking vehicle problem although wa 2 minute felt like eternity everyone minute wa turn approached guy said hi basic conversation attendant looked wa smiling see face mask eye smiling asked wheter wa problem needed routine check gave time anyone else told would take another 2 hour vehicle servicing done said problem thanked afterwards wa waiting outside service center wa another hour go attendant come strike conversation little patience gave discount made friend,turn people service industry appreciate treated like human,fr 1 chap
I installed a computer part all by myself!,"A couple of years or so ago, my mom gave me her old desktop because she never used it.  It had some pretty decent components, near-gaming quality at the time she installed them.  Alas, like all good things, some of the parts must eventually come to an end.


The graphics card had apparently been giving me some problems.  I updated the drivers a couple of weeks ago, and that's when the trouble really started.  Kept getting BSODs left and right, especially while watching YouTube videos or even just browsing the web.


Bought a new graphics card that came today.  It's a MSI GEFORCE GT 710.  I know it's not the latest and greatest in the world, but I don't play any really heavy-duty, graphics-laden games like some of the MMOs or other games.  I only play pretty casual games; the most graphics-laden might be some of the more realistic walking sims/adventure games like *Quern: Undying Thoughts, Obduction,* or *Dear Esther: Landmark Edition*.  The only fast-paced game I play is *Pinball FX3*.


Wrestled with the old card, popped the new one in, went in ""slicker than owl shit"" (as my mom would put it), and so far it seems to be running fine *knocks on wood*.


The old card was apparently dying for at least a year.  Everytime I'd boot up the box, it'd sound like a [Cessna engine](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VFCRXv6nYNI) with rusty parts.  I'd have to hit it in a ""sweet spot"" (yay percussive maintenance) to get it to quiet down.  Now she's quieter than a church mouse during a funeral.


I just know that I'll have to replace some of the other parts.  I plan to run a scan to make sure there's no malwares or other things that might cause further BSODs.  I'll run the deep scan when I go to bed, sleeping soundly knowing that my scanner will nuke any and all found programs out of existence.",PatrickRsGhost,0,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/CasualConversation/comments/ikxbvf/i_installed_a_computer_part_all_by_myself/,couple year ago mom gave old desktop never used pretty decent component near gaming quality time installed ala like good thing part must eventually come end graphic card apparently giving problem updated driver couple week ago trouble really started kept getting bsods left right especially watching youtube video even browsing web bought new graphic card came today msi geforce gt 710 know latest greatest world play really heavy duty graphic laden game like mmos game play pretty casual game graphic laden might realistic walking sims adventure game like quern undying thought obduction dear esther landmark edition fast paced game play pinball fx3 wrestled old card popped new one went slicker owl shit mom would put far seems running fine knock wood old card wa apparently dying least year everytime boot box sound like cessna engine http www youtube com watch v vfcrxv6nyni rusty part hit sweet spot yay percussive maintenance get quiet quieter church mouse funeral know replace part plan run scan make sure malwares thing might cause bsods run deep scan go bed sleeping soundly knowing scanner nuke found program existence,installed computer part,patrick r ghost

I'm getting back into the things I loved as a child,"And it's like a breath of fresh air. After graduating high school I went through some hard stuff mentally. I grew out of my habits and would just sink myself into the same three tv shows while drinking a six pack every night.

I live on a farm with all kinds of animals. I've been seeing my friends regularly. I started carving out time to weight lift again, and the soreness feels amazing. I started downloading games on my Xbox and playing again, something I never had the attention span or willpower to do just last year. I bought a book light, and for the first time in six years, I stayed up late into the night reading Harry Potter until I fell asleep. I do yoga every morning and night, and I actually look forward to it. I broke out my old guitar and have been playing my scales. 

I'm the happiest I've been in a long time, and I'm so grateful for it. I don't know what I changed, or how it happened, but I'm glad to finally be feeling better.

2020 marks 10 years since I graduated high school and life is not what I expected AT ALL,"I just realized it’s been a DECADE since I graduated high school and as the title says I never would have imagined my current life for myself.

Obviously we’re not having a reunion given the circumstances surrounding covid-19 and I’m glad we’re not because I don’t think I’d be necessarily proud of who I am in the moment.

Maybe in 2-5 more years I’d be happier to present myself to society again.

I was one of those go-to-college kids. I was dead set on “the path”. I was gonna have the dream 9-5 job. The nice car. The nice house. The perfect family.

Such a sheep. I know. And ever since, those 18 year old expectations have imploded in my face leading me to search out a new path for myself in life. Let’s just say 18 year old me would never believe it.

I moved far away from my home town for several years, started my own business, have the pleasure from working at home, am way more overweight that I want to be, might be getting married soon, and have money in the bank I never thought I would.

Some of it is good. Some of it is not as good as I would hope. But I see now that I want to improve. I want to get better. And I want to become someone my 18 year old self would be extremely proud of.

I’m almost there. Just have to keep working hard.

I guess let this be a bit of insight to some of you younger ones in high school right now. Life is unpredictable. You truly never know where you’ll end up. Enjoy the ride and pursue your dreams.

Also take care of your body. It’s the only you’ll ever have. Sleep well. Consume good things. Move your body. Here’s to 2020 come what may.

I follow Robin Williams' Instagram,"I was deleting a bunch of accounts off my Instagram when I ran across ""therobinwilliams"". It didnt have a blue check or one of those IG circle things, so I automatically thought it was a fan page (ugh, I hate those).

It just made me sad going through the pictures he shared with the world and he still felt like he was alone.

Robin Williams was a hero to me. I still tear up and can't watch Dead Poets Society. He helped me push through a lot of depression as a teenager and I was absolutely devastated when he committed suicide.

"I just went to Chinatown in Houston for the first time today, and I loved it, but I kept getting stared at. What’s the deal?","I went with my buddy, who grew up in a Chinese family.

But one thing stuck out to me that made me a bit uncomfortable. I kept getting stared at. I’m a white guy, so maybe that had something to do with it? I didn’t see any other white folks around.

Drama shows are fun for a while, and I enjoyed my share of them, but I wanted to laugh and escape a not so fun everyday life.
I chose community because it was created by Dan Harmon and I could'nt be more happy that I did.

I love everything about it, the characters (though sometimes you want to shake/slap some of them), what happens in the episodes and how crazy it is, and more than anything the sense of belonging. 
How many times have I thought : this is so Britta, yes Abed would think that, Troy and Abed in the morning (the music stays!)...
It is so positive.
I don't think I laughed so much watching a tv show. 
And now I don't really know what to watch next! 
I wanted to share it with you, maybe get your best moment from the show? 
IMO the best episode is ""Epidemiology"" season 2 episode 6, one of the first time I thought : WTF is going on! 
Maybe I can get some recommendations for what could be next on my list!
And either way, I am glad I shared that!",AJ404,30,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/CasualConversation/comments/iksncp/i_just_finished_community_and_i_loved_every/,found show netflix ago wa desperate find new tv show light fun drama show fun enjoyed share wanted laugh escape fun everyday life chose community wa created dan harmon could nt happy love everything character though sometimes want shake slap happens episode crazy anything sense belonging many time thought britta yes abed would think troy abed morning music stay positive think laughed much watching tv show really know watch next wanted share maybe get best moment show imo best episode epidemiology season 2 episode 6 one first time thought wtf going maybe get recommendation could next list either way glad shared,finished community loved every minute,j 404
"I suffer from sleep paralysis, but sometimes, I just let it happen."," 

I suffered from sleep paralysis my entire life. I'd wake up and be completely paralyzed, thinking I'm yelling out for my brother or mom when I'm just making very faint whimpering noises. It feels like my mouth is sewn shut and I physically can't form words, while my body is being weighed down by an invisible force. **(I never see any paralysis demon or anything, I've had no auditory or visual hallucinations since I was a very young child)**

Since moving out of my parents' house 3 years ago, I started having it on and off but now that I sleep next to my girlfriend, she can wake me up to calm me down. I've started recognizing the feelings that happen just before and can prevent it altogether, but sometimes I just ride the high.

I recently started taking a new medication which is giving me terrible insomnia, so most nights I sleep 2-3 hours then lay awake all night. So last night, I woke up around 3:45 AM and could not for the life of me go back to sleep. As soon as I finally started drifting, I got the paralysis feeling and was like ""fuck it, why not?"" and just rode the wave. Immediately after it stopped, I let it happen again 5 to 6 more times before I had a sharp pain in my lower abdomen.

I was diagnosed with a hernia that happened to sneak up on me at some point a few weeks ago, and spending a stupid amount of time hyperventilating last night caused the hernia to ache incredibly. Imagine getting flicked by Dwayne The Rock Johnson in just **one nut,** that's what it feels like.

Luckily I didn't wake up my girlfriend but at least until I get this hernia fixed, I'm gonna stop abusing the paralysis.

Does anyone else here suffer from sleep paralysis? If so, how do you manage it or break out of it? I've found just recognizing my surroundings and focusing on what's real (i.e. my breathing) works well for me.",pienerparker,4,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/CasualConversation/comments/ikr5zy/i_suffer_from_sleep_paralysis_but_sometimes_i/,suffered sleep paralysis entire life wake completely paralyzed thinking yelling brother mom making faint whimpering noise feel like mouth sewn shut physically form word body weighed invisible force never see paralysis demon anything auditory visual hallucination since wa young child since moving parent house 3 year ago started sleep next girlfriend wake calm started recognizing feeling happen prevent altogether sometimes ride high recently started taking new medication giving terrible insomnia night sleep 2 3 hour lay awake night last night woke around 3 45 could life go back sleep soon finally started drifting got paralysis feeling wa like fuck rode wave immediately stopped let happen 5 6 time sharp pain lower abdomen wa diagnosed hernia happened sneak point week ago spending stupid amount time hyperventilating last night caused hernia ache incredibly imagine getting flicked dwayne rock johnson one nut feel like luckily wake girlfriend least get hernia fixed gonna stop abusing paralysis doe anyone else suffer sleep paralysis manage break found recognizing surroundings focusing real e breathing work well,suffer sleep paralysis sometimes let happen,pie ner parker

I'm healing!,"Exactly one year ago I had 10kg less, but my stress levels were through the roof, anxiety and struggling with depression.
I was living with other 4 family members, 3 of which were also sick, one trying to revive from several strokes that had fatal consequences, their wife, the most terrible person I've met, my mom, who had a severe undiagnosed kidney problem and my grandmother, recovering from a cancer surgery.
I am the youngest, so I had to deal with all that, not  able to show emotion so things could appear somewhat normal. 

Today I got my blood sample test results and I'm much better, eating healthier than last year, feeling better and happier. Do I like what I see on the mirror?

I finally feel like I understand healthy relationships,"I recently became single after a 3 year long semi-unhealthy relationship. I'm in my last year of college, and with covid running rampant on campus, I was really stressed about who I would interact with or who I could see. I got really lucky, because I have a close knit group of 7 friends who have not only stayed safe with me, but have taught me so much within the past 5 weeks. They are so willing to lend me their time and ear whenever I need, without any sense of me owing them anything. I've learned how to draw boundaries with people, how to lean on people without becoming dependent on their support, and how to communicate how I feel without fear of upsetting someone. I am just really excited because I assumed these were all things that were unique to relationships or that didn't occur at all with most people you interact with.

"I'm going back to school tomorrow. I have mixed feelings. Fellow students and parents : and you, how do you feel ?","I'm going to school tomorrow, in 12th grade. It feels a little bit weird. I don't live in the US, masks are mandatory here but not really social distancing. We have already been warned that there will be cases in schools, and that if there's a case in a school everyone will be tested under 48 hours. But I don't believe that. I haven't been in school since March so I think it will be a little bit difficult to keep the rythm of school. My parents are teachers and I have a brother (we all live together), so I've accepted the fact that there's a high probability that I'm gonna catch it. I will try to be as careful as possible, that's all I can do.

On the other hand, I'm exited to see my friends and learn new things

In conclusion, I have kind of mixed feelings. Excited and resigned at the same time.

So, for fellow students who start school this week and for those who are already back in school : in which grade are you ? How do you feel about this return to school ? Do you feel secure ? What are the measures in place at your school ? How is your class ? Do you have friends with you ?

For parents : how do you feel ? Are you sending your child(ren) back to school (and why) ? Do you think the measures taken are enough ? How is it going so far (if your child(ren) is/are already back to school) ?

"This could be my last summer ever, and I’m devastated.","I’m going into my last year at university, and I’ve finally found a close knit friend group that helps me escape the world. 

Before this summer, video games were my escape. I’d play most days after school and sports to relax. I haven’t touched video games in 5 months. 

It’s very cliché but when we’re together the rest of the world stops. This summer has been one for the record books. We went on countless trips together.. camping, movie nights, weekend vacations, everything. It was also an absolute bender! I’ve never had more fun in my life. I’ve never been this happy. 

When we graduate next year, I’m scared that the adventures will stop. No one is planning on moving away, but people will be getting jobs and will start to move on with their lives. 

I’m struggling to deal with it now, even though there is a whole year of school left.

I think it's really funny how The Road to El Dorado (2000) has exactly one musical number.,"Edit: The single musical number is [""It's Tough to be a God.""](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igxDzfJ2MPo) It's around the middle of the movie. At no other point in the movie does an on-screen character sing. 

Like, if you're just going to put one in there, then it's not a musical. There are some other songs in the movie, but none that are actually performed by characters. It's just such a bizarre narritive choice to have the movie be so completely not a musical, but then stick a single musical number into the middle of it. I would love to have been in the final script meeting where that got decided, or in the editing room when some producer said ""Take out all the rest of the songs, except that one. I like that one."" 

And it's not like in some other movies where they insert a single musical number as a storytelling device for how over the top a character is feeling, like in 500 Days of Summer for example. And The Road to El Dorado CERTAINLY isn't a Bollywood movie, where inserting a single musical number in an otherwise un-musical movie is a common occurrence. 

I don't think it's necessarily a bad thing. I like The Road to El Dorado! I just think it's really funny and strange, and I'm sure the decision to do it is some whacky story of bizarre editing and ridiculous studio restrictions that we'll never hear about.",Un_Ecrivain,4,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/CasualConversation/comments/iknpv2/i_think_its_really_funny_how_the_road_to_el/,edit single musical number tough god http www youtube com watch v igxdzfj2mpo around middle movie point movie doe screen character sing like going put one musical song movie none actually performed character bizarre narritive choice movie completely musical stick single musical number middle would love final script meeting got decided editing room producer said take rest song except one like one like movie insert single musical number storytelling device top character feeling like 500 day summer example road el dorado certainly bollywood movie inserting single musical number otherwise un musical movie common occurrence think necessarily bad thing like road el dorado think really funny strange sure decision whacky story bizarre editing ridiculous studio restriction never hear,think really funny road el dorado 2000 ha exactly one musical number,un ec riva

I'm going through some things in my personal life, and feel like people are always telling me what I want to hear,  not the hard truth. Having this conversation the other day was SO refreshing,  because it was so honest! When you're chatting with people you don't know,  and probably will never see again,  the truth comes out! And I love it! I wish everyone in life was so completely honest and real with me.

So I try deactivating the account BUT I can't do it for more than a day. Either I'm forced to open it because of boredom or i start thinking about what if someone messages me and a kind of FOMO comes off and I end up getting back.

Today I have been told that I wasn't made for university.,"*Sorry in advance for the very long post.*

So today was my last exam (we have a second chance for exams and it starts around the middle of august until the beginning of september) and it was via videocall. This semester has been really hard for me, I failed almost all my exams in june so I had a lot of them to re-do in august. Today I didn't even want to try for my last exam but it was too late to send an email to the teacher so I just continued working and tried my best not to fail but I didn't really believe in it because I'm very concious that it was okay, plus I already knew I failed the whole year ([here is an article that explains the system](https://ec.europa.eu/education/resources-and-tools/european-credit-transfer-and-accumulation-system-ects_en) of ECTS if you care, it's not very important though).

So I ended up failing that exam and at the end the teacher said that I wasn't made for university, and then that I was probably *""the kind of student who believed they just have to read the course once and then it's done because my course is not as important as maths or chemistry""*. I seriously don't know why she said all that but it hurt, she knew I went through rough times but still did that. I know I am capable of doing it, this year has been harder and I know it because my stress never stopped me from studying and this time it even gave me anxiety attacks.

"Last night, I was going through a case of nicotine poisoning.","My friend and I have a tradition we started 3 years ago where each of us had one cigar for the year. Neither of us are frequent smokers, and I personally don't smoke tobacco at all, so when I say I only have one cigar a year, it's literally one cigar a year. It's meant to be a celebratory get together where we go to a cigar lounge and drink scotch and soda. We meet a lot of other interesting people too, but last night was a night I'll never forget.

My biggest problem with smoking cigars is pacing myself. I get the idea that smoking will keep the cigar lit, and it will go out easily. This was my likely mistake, but what follows after I finish happens slowly. First I become nauseous. It's not unusual for me to get uneasy after smoking in a lounge, but this time the sensation only kept getting worse. No sugary soda or amount of fresh air would get me to sober up.

 Next thing I knew, I felt a knot starting to form up in my gut. The best way to describe it was a constant sharp pain that was only made worse from me moving my diaphragm. Luckily, at this point we were on our way back to my friend's apartment (he's driving), but with sudden movement, breaks, accelerating, turns, and bumps, I felt my entire body reeling in pain. Add on top of that being drenched with sweat and being completely numb in my hands and fore arms. I was in rough shape and I'm a lot of pain, but we made it back.

It took every ounce of strength for me just to sit myself up and just turn to be facing outside of the car when he parked. He urged me to stay right where I was, and as soon as he was gone my instinct told me that whatever was in my gut needed to come out.  It was a good thing I had regurgitated one we had parked so the contents of my stomach were on the pavement and not in/on his car. That surprisingly did the trick as I started to quickly recover from my spouts of pain, although still a bit nauseous and a bit dehydrated now.

The rest of the night was uneventful, thankfully. A few Tylenol, some seltzer water, and a few hours of sleep later I was fully recovered. Looking into what had happened exactly, my main hypothesis is that I may have accidentally ingested some of the tobacco leaves from my own cigar. Otherwise, it's possible that it was from smoking the cigar too quickly. Either way, I'll still plan on another cigar next year and take with me what I learned from last night's episode.",polysnip,7,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/CasualConversation/comments/ikjdob/last_night_i_was_going_through_a_case_of_nicotine/,friend tradition started 3 year ago u one cigar year neither u frequent smoker personally smoke tobacco say one cigar year literally one cigar year meant celebratory get together go cigar lounge drink scotch soda meet lot interesting people last night wa night never forget biggest problem smoking cigar pacing get idea smoking keep cigar lit go easily wa likely mistake follows finish happens slowly first become nauseous unusual get uneasy smoking lounge time sensation kept getting worse sugary soda amount fresh air would get sober next thing knew felt knot starting form gut best way describe wa constant sharp pain wa made worse moving diaphragm luckily point way back friend apartment driving sudden movement break accelerating turn bump felt entire body reeling pain add top drenched sweat completely numb hand fore arm wa rough shape lot pain made back took every ounce strength sit turn facing outside car parked urged stay right wa soon wa gone instinct told whatever wa gut needed come wa good thing regurgitated one parked content stomach pavement car surprisingly trick started quickly recover spout pain although still bit nauseous bit dehydrated rest night wa uneventful thankfully tylenol seltzer water hour sleep later wa fully recovered looking happened exactly main hypothesis may accidentally ingested tobacco leaf cigar otherwise possible wa smoking cigar quickly either way still plan another cigar next year take learned last night episode,last night wa going case nicotine poisoning,poly snip

Why do I not gain any form of satisfaction or enjoyment when playing games anymore?,"Currently I'm 25, I've played games for a very long time. Like a lot of people have. To me, it seems like I don't enjoy games anymore, despite the fact I still want to play them. 

I'm not sure if it's because I'm in the *adulting* world, or what it is. I used to play games for hours on end as a kid. It didn't matter the console. From the Nintendo Gameboy to the PS3 back when all of those were big, shoot, I even played N64, the original Nintendo, the SEGA, etc. 

I had so much fun playing games. Nowadays, I don't get the same satisfaction. Is it because most games require an online presence? The cost of the games? I don't even know anymore. 

My favorite series has and always will be the Assassin's Creed series. The whole Ezio trilogy was by far the best out of the whole AC series to date. 

Now I play games and it's like I don't have fun anymore. Even though I want to play them. I'll sit there, try and decide a game I want to play, waste 30 minutes deciding and then only play for 15-30 minutes. 

Anyone else dealing with the same dilemma? I know I have a wife and daughter, so I spend time with my family and I do work as well. I just wish I could enjoy games like I once did.

Do you ever think of people from you past &amp; wonder what they're up to?,"I'm 28. I haven't lived a ton of life, but I've had some really good friends along the way, and unfortunately I've lost touch with a lot of them. 

I'm married with an SO I love very much, and I'm not looking to spark anything from my past, but there are just times where I am overcome with this need to find out what is happening in the lives of the people I've left behind. These can be acquaintances, friends, exes, anybody. I just often think about where people are. 

I think the biggest thing is that I want people to be successful, even if our relationship (however long or short or platonic it was) wasn't successful. I don't know. I spent a lot of time scrolling through Twitter and Instagram this evening trying to find an old high school friend. Him and I were close, at least I thought we were, but I think he removed himself from all social media. The one account I could find is inactive with no posts on it. I'd love to reconnect, even if just for a day to catch up on where life has taken us. 

I don't like getting older. I dont feel older, just the same old stupid 17 y/o stuck in an almost 30 y/o body. Maybe one day I'll reconnect with some of those lost friends, until then I just continue to be nostalgic about the great things they helped me to accomplish and the encouragement they provided as I went through different chapters of my life. They will always hold a special place in my heart, every single person I've ever met. 

That's it. 

Stay in touch with the people who matter the most, even if only for a chapter, cuz in the long run they're going to be the most important people in your memories.

To start of the story, my bf and I were abroad like 3 or something months ago with my PIL, and stayed at a friend of theirs. It was more on the rural side of the country, and we strolled along the neighborhood to have a look at the houses and gardens. We found a close neighbor that had like 10 or something cats in her garden, and they didn't look like they were cared for properly (cats have a different value there than they do in our home country). Anyways, we noticed too very white, blue eyed kittens and fell in love with them immediately! We stopped by every day to watch them play through the fence. After four days we talked about adopting them and asked our friend to come over with us and translate, to ask whether she would be willing to give them away. Owner was fine with that, and we decided to come back later because they were still to young to get away from their mother. 

Moving forward three weeks, we come back, for the owner to tell us, that she would only give away one kitten, because her daughter wanted to keep the other one. Fine with us! Next day arrives, and we're going over to pick up ours. When we saw them, it was... well.. a little shock. Like 5 of the cats there had a really bad eye infection, including our little one, and the other kitten hasn't seemed to grow AT ALL in these 3 weeks. They looked malnourished, and actually like they've been abandoned. We picked up Odin (already had decided on that name) and drove to the vet. The vet was rather concerned about him, because everything he blinked, alot of pus (?) came out of his eyes, but she said as soon as we're conducting a vet at home, it should be fine. 

When we got back, we talked to the owner again, to tell her what the vet told us (that they should get checked as soon as possible) but she kinda just shrugged and only told us, to take care of his ears, as there is barley any fur and they could get sunburnt easily. We take that advice, but since we're only keeping him inside, we didn't think too much about it.

So the day of leaving we come back to her one more time, to thank her, and see that one of her grown cats (also purely white) has a SEVERE sunburn on his ears. I'm talking black crumbs, probably falling off soon, and really in no good condition. She doesn't care. We pack our stuff and our little Odin and off we go home. 

During the car ride he was really well behaved, only cried when he wanted water (which he got). 

When we got home he was too tired to inspect everything and just layed down with us on the couch. We got home on Friday evening, so we had to wait till Monday to get him to a vet. That weekend was horrifying! He just laid with us the whole time, didn't eat, barley drank. We were really scared that he wouldn't make it

BUT Odin is a fighter! We took him to the vet (she also was concerned) and she gave us everything we need. 

Its been about 6 weeks now that he is with us, and he is growing so much and is very active! He shows us love, I never thought would be possible to get from a pet! His eyes are still a little infected, and the vet said (after many more appointments) that maybe it will never be gone completely because it was so bad when he was young. We're still treating him, and it got way better, so as soon as he doesn't seem to be sick, we're happy. 

Two weeks after we got him, we also got him a little black kitten friend (Freya) because we're not home all day, and after just two days they began to eat out of the same bowl. So, that worked out waaaay better than expected! 

Sorry that this got so long, but I just looked at pictures from six weeks ago (skinny, malnourished little kitten) and today (well fed, active teenager-cat) and I feel so much happiness for that little guy, and that he feels so comfortable in his new home with us and his sister, my heart could explode! I'm really glad we got to keep him with us and that he fought through everything. There's still a journey ahead of us, but I think he will manage. Sometimes I think about the other cats, and the other kitten, and whether he made it, but for now I'm glad, that we were able to give Odin a loving home!",MeeZi3110,0,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/CasualConversation/comments/ikgw6k/precious_little_kitten_brightens_up_our_life/,hello wanted share ha making happy last 1 amp 1 2 month start wanna say first time poster english second language covid 19 regulation violated maybe longer adventure realized long story start story bf abroad like 3 something month ago pil stayed friend wa rural side country strolled along neighborhood look house garden found close neighbor like 10 something cat garden look like cared properly cat different value home country anyways noticed white blue eyed kitten fell love immediately stopped every day watch play fence four day talked adopting asked friend come u translate ask whether would willing give away owner wa fine decided come back later still young get away mother moving forward three week come back owner tell u would give away one kitten daughter wanted keep one fine u next day arrives going pick saw wa well little shock like 5 cat really bad eye infection including little one kitten seemed grow 3 week looked malnourished actually like abandoned picked odin already decided name drove vet vet wa rather concerned everything blinked alot pu came eye said soon conducting vet home fine got back talked owner tell vet told u get checked soon possible kinda shrugged told u take care ear barley fur could get sunburnt easily take advice since keeping inside think much day leaving come back one time thank see one grown cat also purely white ha severe sunburn ear talking black crumb probably falling soon really good condition care pack stuff little odin go home car ride wa really well behaved cried wanted water got got home wa tired inspect everything layed u couch got home friday evening wait till monday get vet weekend wa horrifying laid u whole time eat barley drank really scared make odin fighter took vet also wa concerned gave u everything need 6 week u growing much active show u love never thought would possible get pet eye still little infected vet said many appointment maybe never gone completely wa bad wa young still treating got way better soon seem sick happy two week got also got little black kitten friend freya home day two day began eat bowl worked waaaay better expected sorry got long looked picture six week ago skinny malnourished little kitten today well fed active teenager cat feel much happiness little guy feel comfortable new home u sister heart could explode really glad got keep u fought everything still journey ahead u think manage sometimes think cat kitten whether made glad able give odin loving home,precious little kitten brightens life,mee zi 3110
Running out of things to do,"M, 22
 I  was getting trained in an IT company, and from march till now I have only worked like 12 days. Yes I get paid. I was a cinephile and loved video games in my college days. Now I am running out of things to do, movies and games seem lame. I don't want to work on my skills too, as it seems futile. I tried writing a novel and it was fun for a week. But that's over too. I smoke weed often, but since weed is not legal here and it's my hometown , I have to be pretty discrete. I don't know a lot of people here except some close friends who I meet in evening for short duration. I tried talking to people online too, but it's hard to strike conversations after basic information. I don't even know why I am writing it. This life seems so purposeless now.

Our caterers cancelled an hour before the wedding yesterday and it was fine,"Our caterers bailed at literally the last minute (yes, I am getting a refund). They're a local couple who started a catering business a few years ago and I think, basically, their marriage imploded that morning and he phoned my (now) husband in tears telling him they weren't coming at about quarter to two. The ceremony began at three. 

My first impressions of them were that they were a bit useless but honest and we'd been to an event they catered so I knew they were good cooks and they had good reviews... they *were* completely useless but they were honest about it, so I got that part right anyway. I do feel sorry for them - I really think that their marriage fell apart and he was in tears when he phoned. They've agreed to refund the money but asked for a bit of time as things are tight at the moment and I'll keep an eye on my account but that's a thought process for another day. 

So, we had to arrange food with literally no notice by ringing friends and asking them to run round the supermarket on the way there (remember, the ceremony was in an hour) and just bring what they could carry and they did an outstanding job. They grabbed literally anything they could that was ready to serve.

Telling my mother was honestly the most stressful part because she looked like she was about to explode but I did not have the mental space to deal with that so I just said very loudly that *it's fine now and it's sorted and we're not getting stressed* to which she replied ""no, we're not going to get stressed"". 

She was a caterer for years (but retired from it) and I helped her out a lot, so we basically managed the logistics of it all and formulated the quickest plan in the history of really quick plans... and it was fine. Between her, my friends who ran into the nearest supermarket and picked up as much as they could carry and my other friend who immediately took charge of serving the drinks... it all worked. 

We, miraculously, had bought some paper plates, paper napkins and recyclable plastic forks for the cake and the venue manager (who was doing it on her own!) was literally going through the cupboards for anything she could lend us. She was amazed at how we weren't having a nervous breakdown about it.

At least it was only 30 people, I guess. Plague restrictions meant the numbers had to be low, which was actually okay because we were no longer obliged to invite certain people so it was very much a Greatest Hits of our friends and family. 

We have already had to reorganise the wedding to varying extents *four times*, so getting here has been a bit of a journey, but I am now married and everyone had a good time and it was all okay in the end. 

A slow stream of photos is arriving via whatsapp, email and bookface messenger. Need to go to the bottle bank tomorrow. 

So, if you're planning a wedding and stressing out over chair covers and seating plans and what to feed your guests - don't worry about it. It'll be fine. At least your caterers will turn up. 

And if they don't... at least you'll get a story out of it.

Edit: My brother found this post so I want to also add that he did a really nice job with the flowers and I'm really grateful for his help.

My (very) pregnant neighbour asked if she could have some of whatever I am cooking.,"My super pregnant neighbour knocked on my door and said (paraphrasing) ""can I have a bowl of whatever you're cooking, it smells nice and my pregnancy cravings are going crazy""

Damned right am I feeding this lady. She may have come over feeling awkward for asking, but if she thinks she'd  be leaving without a full plate and a tupperware container of my beef shin ragu she's got no idea how wrong she is.

I felt so proud and accomplished making something that someone had smelled and though ""Well I need me some of that"".

I told her that if there is anything that ever smells nice coming from my apartment, there is a plate for her no questions asked.

Cooking/baking has been my lockdown project, and that poor woman has no idea how much food is coming her way.

EDIT: Wow holy shit, I expected 3 messages asking what I was cooking not 500. Thanks for the awards and all.

A weird amount of messages asking why I'm lying for karma. My account is 3 years old and this is my first post, if If I liked lying for karma I'm pretty bad at it. Slow cook a ragu and trust me your place will smell like it for days, I don't know if its balls or desperation but think if I were pregnant and not just fat I'd feel pretty okay asking neighbours I've met before for whatever specific thing they were cooking.

For the redditors saying I should continue offering food once the baby is here, that sounds like a great idea, I think I'll slip a note on her door saying I'll make some extra portions for whenever she wants them.

Also, **RECIPE**:

Take your beef shin, (crust it) roll it around in course sea salt, cracked black pepper, and dried rosemary, let it sit in the crust for overnight in the fridge. Then take it out and sear it in butter until its browned on the outside and let rest for 30 mins, smother it in olive oil, and lightly cover in foil so steam can escape and roast at 180c for 2.5 hours.

Once it is done let it rest for 1 hour and get started on the sauce: Roast 3-4 vines of picollo tomatoes in salt and olive oil for 40mins. whilst that is cooking finely dice 1 large onion, 1 large carrot, and 2-3 sticks of celery.

Saute the carrot first, cover the pan so you sweat it then add the onion until it all looks soft, then add the celery and 5 crushed cloves of garlic and fry for about another 4 minutes until it all looks soft, then when the pan is still very hot throw in a glass of red wine to deglaze the pan. wait 1.5 mins for the alcohol to evaporate and add 500ml of rich beef stock mixed in with fresh rosemary.

Let it all bubble for a bit on mid heat then throw in your roasted tomatoes and break them up a bit with a wooden spoon, add FRESH basil and some dried oregano, if you can some fresh parsley too, a couple bayleaves and good splash or two of Worcestershire sauce. 

Move onto your beef and use two forks to shred the meat, dont cut it, shred it. then add it to your bubbling sauce.

I like to leave it on a very low simmer for about 2-3 hours until most of the water has been reduced off and you're left with a very thick and rich ragu that is worth the effort put into it.

For the pasta I suggest a fresh tagliatelle or pappardelle because the sauce is very rich and doesn't need pastas that will cling onto the sauce.

This recipe is for about 4-5 servings because its so easy to freeze and fuck going through this much effort every time you want a ragu for one.",OrcaOne,528,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/CasualConversation/comments/ij1pzu/my_very_pregnant_neighbour_asked_if_she_could/,super pregnant neighbour knocked door said paraphrasing bowl whatever cooking smell nice pregnancy craving going crazy damned right feeding lady may come feeling awkward asking think leaving without full plate tupperware container beef shin ragu got idea wrong felt proud accomplished making something someone smelled though well need told anything ever smell nice coming apartment plate question asked cooking baking ha lockdown project poor woman ha idea much food coming way edit wow holy shit expected 3 message asking wa cooking 500 thanks award weird amount message asking lying karma account 3 year old first post liked lying karma pretty bad slow cook ragu trust place smell like day know ball desperation think pregnant fat feel pretty okay asking neighbour met whatever specific thing cooking redditors saying continue offering food baby sound like great idea think slip note door saying make extra portion whenever want also recipe take beef shin crust roll around course sea salt cracked black pepper dried rosemary let sit crust overnight fridge take sear butter browned outside let rest 30 min smother olive oil lightly cover foil steam escape roast 180c 2 5 hour done let rest 1 hour get started sauce roast 3 4 vine picollo tomato salt olive oil 40mins whilst cooking finely dice 1 large onion 1 large carrot 2 3 stick celery saute carrot first cover pan sweat add onion look soft add celery 5 crushed clove garlic fry another 4 minute look soft pan still hot throw glass red wine deglaze pan wait 1 5 min alcohol evaporate add 500ml rich beef stock mixed fresh rosemary let bubble bit mid heat throw roasted tomato break bit wooden spoon add fresh basil dried oregano fresh parsley couple bayleaves good splash two worcestershire sauce move onto beef use two fork shred meat dont cut shred add bubbling sauce like leave low simmer 2 3 hour water ha reduced left thick rich ragu worth effort put pasta suggest fresh tagliatelle pappardelle sauce rich need pasta cling onto sauce recipe 4 5 serving easy freeze fuck going much effort every time want ragu one,pregnant neighbour asked could whatever cooking,orca one

Why do people who are older than me say that I can’t be tired just because of my age?,"I don’t understand this at all, and maybe someone who can recall a similar situation when they were a teen who is now an adult can help me understand this.

Anyway, a random person that I paired up with asked me if I was tired and I said yes. They just laughed and said there was no way I could be tired at my age (16) since I “wasn’t even in my 20s yet.” Is this true? Does being tired become much much worse? 

Do I truly not have a perspective on what it means to be tired? Because I’ve fallen into depressions before and felt like I could fulfill an eternal slumber if my environment allowed me (parents and responsibilities). Why do adults feel the need to invalidate what I find to be true about *myself?*

But I still struggle a bit with physical contact. I can have a great date, but as soon it is nearing the end I stutter and stumble over my words.

I got complimented for the first time ever today,"I’m a 19 year old guy and other than my family I have never gotten a genuin complement from someone. Today after work I my family ordered Chinese food and I went to go pick it up. I got there a little early so I had to sit and wait about 15 minutes for it to be ready. About 5 minutes after I got there 2 girls, probably my age, walked in and it looked like they were waiting too. I saw one of them wearing a Fear of the Dark Iron Maiden shirt and I was pretty surprised because they didn’t look like the type of people who would like that stuff. Most people who do are much older than me. Naturally I said I like your shirt because cmon, who doesn’t like Iron Maiden. She said thank you and said she’s had plenty more. I asked her if she knew about the new album that could be coming in 2020 and she knew all about it. Our food came at about the same time and we were leaving so I held the door open for them like a gentleman and she said thank you and said “now that I’m closer i can see you have pretty eyes”.

"As a male, I’m so tired of the lack of unique clothing available.","As a male it’s insanely frustrating to browse women’s clothing and see all of the unique styles they have. From the draping, silhouettes, layering, and asymmetry, to the colors, neck lines, and details. There are so many cool and unique options.  

Then I look in the men’s section and it’s all the fucking same.   

Crew neck or vneck  
Straight cut or slim cut  
A sea of solid color patterns and primary colors  
Little to no small details  
No draping  
No asymmetry  
You want to layer? Here, wear this plaid shirt unbuttoned over a grey tee shirt. If you want to get really crazy with it, swap out the tee for a long sleeve Henley and cuff the sleeves on the outside .......  

I’m so tired of having to buy clothes from expensive specialty stores just to find something unique. 

Men deserve more variation.

My teenager made me so proud tonight with a simple gesture,"I have 4 boys ranging from ages 3 to 14. Tonight the 3 year old was very tired, which of course makes him resistant to bedtime. As I was carrying him past my oldest's door (which is perpetually closed) he asked to see his big brother. I knocked and asked my oldest if he would talk to his baby brother. This aloof, too cool for everything teenager got up and held his baby brother and comforted him, rocking and talking to him until he was calm enough to accept his own bed.

"After 30 years of being open, my family’s restaurant is closing tonight.","My family has owned a fine dining italian restaurant since before i was born. Most all of my childhood memories are in that restaurant. Everyday after school i’d go do my homework at the bar, i’d follow my dad around the kitchen and help with little things like making salads, and i will never forget making my first pizza at 4 years old. Whenever it stormed really bad and we lost power my family would go and sleep on the floor in the dining room — it was always a safe space. It was always somewhere for us to go, something for us to do, something that needed constant watering and attention. It’s been my family’s livelihood for my entire existence. It’s kept my belly full as well as my heart. It’s my father’s lifelong work and it’s made me respect him sooo much after 30 years of being there to cook for 14+ hours a day. I don’t know who i’d be without this restaurant. It’s shaped me in ways that i couldn’t possibly explain over a reddit post. It’s made me confident, brave, not scared of a little heat, and i’ve built incredible relationships with a staff that i’ve been so lucky to work with for so long. 

I started taking it seriously when i was about 15. I was a busgirl at first. And then i was a hostess. And when i got a little older i became a server. I wasn’t very good at that one, especially after spilling red wine on one-too-many older women and embarrassing myself beyond compare. I realized at 18 or so, that like my father, i was a cook. I’m 24 now and i’ve been cooking alongside my dad everyday since i realized i had a knack for it. It’s been beautiful, exhausting, exhilarating, very mentally and emotionally taxing — just an overall whirlwind of emotions every single day. I even made the crazy decision to drop out of college to run the restaurant full-time. I love it though. I love working with my family. I love making people happy and seeing them enjoy the food we work so hard to make. 

Tonight is our last shift ever. Things were going so well over the holidays this past winter but ever since covid hit, it’s been a different story. We had to close to the public for 3 months. And since we’ve been open with limited occupancy, we’re not pulling in those great numbers that we once were. We can no longer afford the rent at our building and had to make the tough decision to close our doors for good. But besides that, it’s time. My parents are in their 60’s. My dad can’t do it anymore. His health is starting to drastically fail because of all the years being constantly on his feet. and he doesn’t want me to have the same life that he did, never being able to give any part of life besides work real attention. My mom and dad are ready to retire and i don’t blame them. 

I’m nervous about tonight. After all these years, this very well might be the last restaurant shift i ever work. I don’t know what the future holds for me, but i don’t think i have any interest continuing my cooking career elsewhere. I decided that without the restaurant, there’s not much keeping me in our town so in October i’m going to take a big risk and move across the country. I’m terrified. I’ve been terrified every day leading up to today. It’s hard to imagine what life is going to be like for me after we close our doors tonight. I’ve just never known anything else. 

I thought it might feel good to tell this story to some faceless strangers. If you read this far, thank you. 

Please continue to support your locally-owned restaurants. The families who own them put a lot of blood, sweat, and tears into running them. Tip your servers well. Thank the chefs if you run into them. Enjoy good food for the rest of your life and eat it with passion. Cheers and buon appetito.

EDIT: the response from this has been absolutely INCREDIBLE. thank you so much for this amazing outpour of love. the shift just ended. i’m sitting in the office alone and thinking about it all, reading these amazing messages from people all across the globe. you’re all wonderful and if it’s any consolation, you’ve made my heart feel so warm. i feel a bit in shock and ready to drink some tequila and enjoy the rest of the night with my coworkers in true restaurant fashion. i’m going to try to respond to all of you in due time. thank you so much. 

2. since this blew up i thought i’d shoot my shot and say i’m planning on moving to Pittsburgh in october. i don’t have a job lined up so if anyone has any openings, let me know! i’m a hard worker and terrified to move with no plans. i just know it’s time to get out of South Carolina. also if you live in pittsburgh and are looking for a new friend, also message me! i don’t know anyone there and would love to meet some of you Yinzers.

3. a lot of people saying they don’t understand how we don’t have enough money to stay open after 30 years. you need to understand that my parents are old. they do have money put aside. but we moved into a newer, bigger location 5 years ago and our asshole landlord doubled the rent 2 years ago. my parents have been putting money from their own pockets into the restaurant for the last year or so. they could keep it up for a few more years, sure. but then they’d lose all their retirement money. the future of restaurants, especially fine dining, is very uncertain right now. my parents would rather retire now and be able to live off their profits for a few years, than put all their remaining money into it for the next 5-10 years and then have nothing. it’s clearly a big decision we’ve been going back and forth on for the past few months. we came to this decision. i respect them for pulling out now at the end of our 5 year lease instead of risking it all. they deserve this. they deserve retirement. it’s time for them to rest and enjoy their time together.

4. so many people are asking why a random place like pittsburgh. i don’t know. i’ve been obsessed with PGH since i was in early highschool and just haven’t been able to get it out of my head. i like the bridges. i like the neighborhoods. i like the hills. i like the parks. and the cobblestone roads. PNC park is the most beautiful ballpark in the country. i love the pride pittsburghers have for their city (something that i never quite felt from the town i grew up in, regardless of the restaurant). i think it’s the most beautiful city in the united states. my favourite artist in the world, mac miller, is from there. it’s a city but it’s not this huge sprawling metropolis like chicago, or NYC, or philly, or LA. i want to be cold. i want to meet strangers with funny accents and have them show me the secret spots in the city. i want to fall in love with pittsburgh like how the people who have lived there their whole lives love it. why not pittsburgh? it seems like the perfect place for me.

This coronavirus things has made me realize people would be a lot happier and explore their passions and interests if they didn’t have to work so much.,"Just live streams of people at home getting in touch with their instruments again, walking their dogs, etc.

People actually seemed to be hanging out with each other, even if it’s just playing my heart will go on or blowing a spitfire ball from the balconies.

I get some people are mad or concerned because of cut hours , or just plain laid off , but if they , and everyone , had the means to the basics of just surviving and being alive it makes me yearn for that society where everyone is happy.

Pre- coronavirus I realized a lot of us work out butts off for very little reward.

"I’m a lunch lady at an elementary school school. They just cancelled school for two weeks, but food service workers will still be reporting to work.","At first I was mad that I would still have to work when everyone else gets two paid weeks off. But then they explained that the reason food service workers will still be expected to report for work is that we have a lot of kids in our district that qualify for free school lunch. For a lot of these kids, the food they get at school may be the only meals they get during the week. We have to keep feeding these kids, not only because they deserve to eat, but also because if they aren’t eating, their immune systems will take a hit and they could be more at risk for COVID-19. 

Even though I would love two weeks off to rest, I feel proud to be a lunch lady and to be feeding these kids who need it!


Edit: Wow, wow, wow! I really didn’t expect this post to get so much attention! Thank you all so much for your kind words and encouragement! I posted this with the intent to let people know that kids from low-income families will be fed, at least in many places that are closing schools, because I know it’s been a topic of concern for a lot of people. I certainly didn’t expect to be called a hero, it’s a little overwhelming and I’m not sure I deserve the title. I’m doing my job. I love my students, every day I see the same kids come in, I know most of them by name. I’ve had little kids who have had a hard day come in with tears in their eyes but light up when they see their favorite lunch being served. I’ve given many a high five to kids who let me know that they tried a new food yesterday and liked it. I’ve tied so, so, SO many little sneaker shoelaces. 

Originally this job was just a stepping stone, a job to make money because I fell on some hard times. I fell out with my parents and left their home on bad terms, lost my previous job suddenly, and worst of all dropped out of college because I couldn’t afford it. I was going to school to become a kindergarten teacher and when I saw the job opening for a lunch lady, I figured it was worth a shot. Better than unemployment. Not only has it been so much more rewarding than I ever imagined, it has really cemented how much I want to continue my education somehow to become a kindergarten/1st grade teacher. My love for these little ones, even on the worst days, is overwhelming. The thought of them going hungry hurts my heart and soul, to the core of my being. So, of course I will do my best to feed them when their parents are struggling to make ends meet. 

Thank you so much for all of you who have shared your stories with me of how the lunch ladies and gentlemen have touched your life. I’ve smiled and cried so much since I posted this, I’m truly touched by the response.


EDIT #2:
Well, this post sure got more attention than I expected it to! I'm really happy to see so many people sharing stories about their experience with lunch ladies and cafeteria staff. It's a great reminder of why we do what we do. I've noticed a lot of people have been asking questions, so let me answer them the best I can!

-I'm in Virginia, USA. Chesterfield County, specifically. 

-While schools are closed, kids can get their meals without having to go into the schools or be exposed to potential illness, we are doing a drive-up, curbside pickup system to minimize exposure. I have heard of other places also doing a delivery system so families without transportation can still receive meals.

-I know that it is appalling that in America, a first world and developed country that is home to some of the wealthiest people on the planet, children are still going hungry. It's appalling that there are parents having children they can't afford to feed and clothe. Right now, neither of those things are my focus. My focus is not to judge these parents or delve into the politics of how this has been allowed to happen. My goal is to make sure that no child in my district is going hungry because schools are having to close due to COVID-19. 

-If you want to help in your own community, there are some options you can look into. First of all, reach out to your own local schools, see what they need. Ask them how you can help. Reach out to food banks in your area. Check in with sources like Feeding America and see what's being done in your area to help out.

-Enough people have reached out to me and asked if I have a gofundme, or have talked about starting one for me to go back to school and achieve my dream of being an elementary school teacher, so I went ahead and made one. Please, nobody needs to feel obligated to give me anything, but I have learned not to question kindness and generosity.
