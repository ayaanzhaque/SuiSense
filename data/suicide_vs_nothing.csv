"New wiki on how to avoid accidentally encouraging suicide, and how to spot covert incitement","We've been seeing a worrying increase in pro-suicide content showing up here and, and also going unreported. This undermines our purpose here, so we wanted to highlight and clarify our guidelines about both direct and indirect incitement of suicide.  

We've created a wiki that covers these issues.  We hope this will be helpful to anyone who's wondering whether something's okay here and which responses to report.  It explains in detail why *any* validation of suicidal intent, even an ""innocent"" message like ""if you're 100% committed, I'll just wish you peace"" is likely to increase people's pain, and why it's important to report even subtle pro-suicide comments. The full text of the wiki's current version is below, and it is maintained at [/r/SuicideWatch/wiki/incitement](http://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/wiki/incitement). 

We deeply appreciate everyone who gives responsive, empathetic, non-judgemental support to our OPs, and we particularly thank everyone who's already been reporting incitement in all forms.  

Please report any post or comment that encourages suicide (or that breaks any of the other guidelines in the sidebar) to the moderators, either by clicking the ""report"" button or by [sending us a modmail](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2FSuicideWatch) with a link. We deal with all guideline violations that are reported to us as soon as we can, but we can't read everything so community reports are essential. If you get a PM that breaks the guidelines, please report it both [to the reddit sitewide admins](http://www.reddit.com/report) and to us in modmail. 

Thanks to all the great citizens of the community who help flag problem content and behaviour for us.

###Summary###

**It's important to respect and understand people's experiences and emotions. It's never necessary, helpful, or kind to support suicidal intent. There are some common misconceptions (discussed below) about suicidal people and how to help them that can cause well-meaning people to inadvertently incite suicide. There are also people online who incite suicide on purpose, often while pretending to be sympathetic and helpful.** 

###Validate Feelings and Experiences, Not Self-Destructive Intentions###

We're here to offer support, not judgement.  That means accepting, with the best understanding we can offer, whatever emotions people express.  Suicidal people are suffering, and we're here to try to ease that by providing support and caring.  The most reliable way we know to de-escalate someone at risk is to give them the experience of feeling understood. That means not judging whether they should be feeling the way they are, or telling them what to do or not do.  

But there's an important line to draw here.  There's a crucial difference between empathizing with feelings and responding non-judgmentally to suicidal thoughts, and in any way endorsing, encouraging, or validating suicidal intentions or hopeless beliefs. 

Anything that condones suicide, even passively, *encourages* suicide. It isn't supportive and does not help. It also violates reddit's sitewide rules as well as our guidelines. Explicitly inciting suicide online is a criminal offense in most jurisdictions. 

Do not treat any OP's post as meaning that will definitely die by suicide and can't change their minds or be helped. Anyone who's able to read the comments here still has a chance to choose whether or not to try to keep living, even if they've also been experiencing intense thoughts of suicide, made a suicide plan, or started carrying it out.  

In [the most useful empirical model we have](https://www.apa.org/science/about/psa/2009/06/sci-brief), the desire to die by suicide primarily comes from two interpersonal factors; alienation and a sense of being a burden or having nothing to offer. These factors usually lead to a profound feeling of being unwelcome in the world. 

**So, any acceptance or reinforcement of suicidal intent, even something ""innocent"" like ""I hope you find peace"", is actually a form of covert shunning that validates a person's sense that they're unwelcome in the world. It will usually add to their pain even if kindly meant and gently worded.**  

###How to Avoid Validating Suicidal Intent###

Keep the following in mind when offering support to anyone at risk for suicide.  

* **People who say they don't want help usually can feel better if they get support that doesn't invalidate their emotions.** Unfortunately, [many popular ""good"" responses are actually counterproductive](https://www.speakingofsuicide.com/2015/03/03/what-not-to-say/). In particular, many friends and family tend to rely exclusively on trying to convince the suicidal person that ""it's not so bad"", and this is usually experienced as ""I don't understand what you're going through and I'm not going to try"".  People who've had ""help"" that made them feel worse don't want any more of the same.  It doesn't mean that someone who actually knows how to be supportive can't give them any comfort.   

*  **Most people who are suicidal want to end their** ***pain,*** **not their lives.**  It's almost never true that death is the only way to end these people's suffering. Of course there are exceptional situations, and we certainly acknowledge that, for some people, the right help can be difficult to find. But preventing someone's suicide doesn't mean prolonging their suffering if we do it by giving them real comfort and understanding. 

* ***An unfixable problem doesn't mean that a good life will never be possible***.  We don't have to fix or change anything to help someone feel better. It's important to keep in mind that the correlation between our outer circumstances and our inner experience is weaker and less direct than commonly assumed.  For every kind of difficult life situation, you will find some people who lapse into suicidal despair, and others who cope amazingly well, and a whole spectrum in between. A key difference is how much inner resilience the person has at the time. This can depend on many personal and situational factors. But when there's not enough, interpersonal support can both compensate for its absence and help rebuild it.  We go into more depth on the ""it gets better"" issue in [this PSA Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/25igd7/whats_wrong_with_it_gets_better_what_if_it_doesnt/) which is always linked from our sidebar (community info on mobile) guidelines. 

* **There are** ***always*** **more choices than brutally forcing someone to stay alive or passively letting them end their lives**.

To avoid accidentally breaking the anti-incitement rule, don't say or try to imply that acting on suicidal thoughts is a good idea, or that someone can't turn back or is already dead.  Do whatever you can to help them feel cared for and welcome, at least in this little corner of the world.  [Our talking tips](http://redd.it/igh87) offer more detailed guidance.

###Look Out for Deliberate Incitement.  It May Come in Disguise.###

Often comments that subtly encourage suicidal intent actually come from suicide fetishists and voyeurs ([unfortunately this is a real and disturbing phenomenon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Francis_Melchert-Dinkel)). People like this *are* out there and the anonymous nature of reddit makes us particularly attractive to them.  

They will typically try to scratch their psychological ""itch"" by saying things that push people closer to the edge.  They often do this by exploiting the myths that we debunked in the bullet points above.  Specifically you might see people doing the following:

* Encouraging the false belief that the only way suicidal people can end their pain is by dying.  **There are** ***always*** **more and better choices than ""brutally forcing someone to stay alive"" or helping (actively or passively) them to end their lives**.

* Creating an artificial and toxic sense of ""solidarity"" by linking their encouragement of suicide to empathy.  They will represent themselves as the only one who really understand the suicidal person, while either directly or indirectly encouraging their self-loathing emotions and self-destructive impulses.  **Since most people in suicidal crisis are in desperate need to empathy and understanding, this is a particularly dangerous form of manipulation.**  

Many suicide inciters are adept at putting a benevolent spin on their activities while actually luring people away from sources of real help.  A couple of key points to keep in mind: 

* **Skilled suicide intervention -- peer or professional -- is based on empathic responsiveness to the person's feelings that reduces their suffering in the moment.**  Contrary to pop-culture myths, it does **not** involve persuasion (""Don't do it!""), cheerleading (""You've got this!"") or meaningless false promises (""Trust me, it gets better!""), or invalidation (""Let me show you how things aren't as bad as you think!"").  Anyone who leads others to expect these kinds of toxic responses, or any other response that prolongs their pain, from expert help may be covertly pro-suicide. (Of course, people sometimes do have bad experience when seeking mental-health treatment, and it's fine to vent about those, but processing our own disappointment and frustration is entirely different from trying to destroy someone else's hope of getting help.)

* **Choices made by competent responders are always informed by the understanding that breaching someone's trust is traumatic and must be avoided if possible.**  Any kind of involuntary intervention is an **extremely unlikely** outcome when someone consults a clinician or calls a hotline. (Confidentiality is addressed in more detail in [our Hotlines FAQ post](http://redd.it/1c7ntr)). The goal is always to provide all help with the client's full knowledge and informed consent. We know that no individual or system is perfect.  Mistakes that lead to bad experiences do sometimes happen to vulnerable people, and we have enormous sympathy for them. But anyone who suggests that this is the norm might be trying to scare people away from the help they need.

Reminder: Absolutely no activism of any kind is allowed here. Any day.,"If you want to recognise an occasion, please do so by offering extra support to those who've asked for it, and by being a good citizen of the community, mindful of our tips and guidelines.

Edit:  In response to multiple requests, I'm adding a definition of activism here:  ""campaigning to bring about political or social change"".  That's straight out of the OED, we aren't making any special interpretation of it. **Any post that is primarily about raising awareness or changing perceptions is activism according to the dictionary definition and thus a violation of the community rules.**

Some examples of the most common types of activists posts we were here, all of which are totally inappropriate:  

* Advocating for changes in laws around suicide

* Advocating for change in the mental-health system 

* Advocating for changes in cultural norms or common perceptions around mental-health.  These are often related to specific days devoted to specific causes, e.g. World Suicide Prevention Day

Keep in mind that our mission here is individual peer support.  Any post that's not a request for personal support regarding current experience related to suicide is probably a rule violation unless it has the ""Mod Approved"" flair.",SQLwitch,124,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/d2370x/reminder_absolutely_no_activism_of_any_kind_is/,want recognise occasion please offering extra support asked good citizen community mindful tip guideline edit response multiple request adding definition activism campaigning bring political social change straight oed making special interpretation post primarily raising awareness changing perception activism according dictionary definition thus violation community rule example common type activist post totally inappropriate advocating change law around suicide advocating change mental health system advocating change cultural norm common perception around mental health often related specific day devoted specific cause e g world suicide prevention day keep mind mission individual peer support post request personal support regarding current experience related suicide probably rule violation unless ha mod approved flair,reminder absolutely activism kind allowed day,sql witch

"8 years ago I posted here, wanting to die. My life is so much better now.","When I was 15-16 years old, I posted here in my darkest moments. I couldn't see any reason to keep living. I thought I was nothing special and the next 8 years seemed like an endless slog. You can look through my post history if you want. 

Since then, I graduated college and graduate school. I have traveled the world. I swam with bioluminescent algae in Indonesia. I've hiked among alpacas in Peru. I learned to speak Spanish fluently and connected with people around the world, and in my own country, who speak Spanish too. I've published my writing i  multiple publications. I have fallen in love and had my heart broken several times. I realized I'm gay, came out, and I'm with the most amazing woman. I have a career that I love where I help people every day. I can honestly say that depression may be a lifelong struggle for me, but it is possible to recover and develop tools to cope with it. Every day is a manageable challenge now. Every day I am grateful to just be alive. I am SO GLAD that I didn't kill myself 8 years ago. I never would have known how beautiful my life could become.

I wasn’t supposed to live past being a teenager,"The stability in my mental health comes and goes and right now it’s particularly bad. I have suffered from mental health issues since I was a child, and it was particularly bad in my teenage years.

I’m in university now, I do my work, get decent grades, but I don’t know what I’m doing. I don’t enjoy anything, my program is okay but I don’t see my future like so many people do. I struggle to make real connections with people, I am so emotionally unavailable and have hurt so many people leading them on and being unable to commit to them. I also barely enjoy sex and am traumatized from being sexually assaulted after a graduation party. I am wasting away my young adult years now, and soon enough I’ll regret not doing anything with my time. Therapy has never worked for me.

My suicide note,"I don’t know when I will pass. I don’t know how many people will know or care. I only want this to say to my parents and siblings and all relatives: I’m sorry. I’m greatly sorry. I will miss you all. But, I cannot continue the journey. 

I wasn’t blessed with looks, brains, talents, or really anything. My passions fizzle out and every ounce of optimism is but a coping tool for misery. I cannot continue down this road. All of those who pass me by, I know I wasn’t worth your time, but just know how blessed you are. With looks, brains, talents. 

Deep down maybe it is just a series of self inflicted devilish mistakes in manipulation and childhood traumas of sexual and psychological abuse. I blame myself wholeheartedly for all my actions and I blame myself for the actions made against me. I am a wretch. I am terrible. 

The only thing I can die with is hoping to meet a loving God. Or perhaps that I was a lonely god. One who created a world from loneliness. One who dreamt it all up. But, with all the suffering and pain and lost desires, God may have forsaken me. And if this is just a Dream then i made one terrible dream. 

I don’t really want to die. But I need to. It’s time I must be going. Mom, everytime you see anything that reminds you of me. Know that I’m sorry. I’m truly sorry.

I can't keep doing this,"(Venting, throwaway account for privacy.)

My mind is blank. I cannot think. I don't want to eat. I don't want to try anymore. I've been trying for almost 30 years now. It hasn't gotten better like everyone said it would. It's just been a series of ups and downs, a rollercoaster that never seems to end. I fucking hate it.

My partner's grad program fucked us over with direct deposit again, so now all our bills are gonna be overdue. Again. We barely have food in the house, and neither of us have had the mental energy lately to cook what we do have. I could pick up more shifts to work all weekend for pennies to try and slowly pay a tiny bit of everything off, but I won't be able to make enough to pay everything. I'll work myself to the brink of death again just to barely get by, smoke to get through the day, and drink to fall asleep at night. Or I could just end it all.

My partner knows I'm mentally ill and tries their best. They go above and beyond any efforts I've ever seen, including my own parents. I don't want to leave them behind. I feel so guilty for feeling this way. But I just can't keep going like this. I want this to be over. And there's no end in sight.

"I thought I was getting better, but I was just lying to myself","Social media is great fun. Just found out that a lot of my friends are hanging out without me tonight, so that's been real fun.
Not a day goes by where I don't think about doing it, but I always think 'Maybe your friends can help. Maybe you can get better.' I've just been lying to myself.
I've been at the edge for a long time now, but I'm just exhausted at this point. I just can't.

I don’t want to do this anymore,"I have been struggling for a while now. 
For as long as I can remember, I’ve always wondered what’s the point of being alive. 
I’ve had good moments, but they have never lasted.

Then I met you. After being alone and lonely for years, I fell in love with you.
You’ve made me happy, you’ve made me sad, you’ve given me confidence, you’ve made me feel awful. 
You’ve played with me. 
You’ve made promises you never intended to keep.
I’ve made choices so we could be together.
I’ve pictured a whole life for us.
And then you’ve changed your mind.
You’ve managed to destroy me. 

I shouldn’t have let you destroy me. I was weak in the first place. 

What’s the point of being alive and being alone? I don’t have you anymore, I don’t have friends. I have work and that’s all. And work gets boring. You don’t live just to work. 

I just feel like I’m ready to give up. I don’t believe it can get better anymore, because if it does get better, it’s only going to get worse afterwards.

I know that you were in a very dark place yourself and that you have since deleted your account (you had mentioned it was a throw away) but I just want to know if you are still out there and if you are still 'okay'.

I know you browsed this subreddit a lot and you always checked up on other people and talked to a ton of others, now I want to check up on you.

What is the point of living?,"8 months ago, the love of my life left me. I put everything I had into salvaging the relationship, but in the end even offering to uproot my whole life for her, it wasn't enough. I sunk really low, but I had a friend who helped me through it and did everything in his power to help me out. I went to theropy for a bit but found it far more stressful than useful, so I turned to self help books. I started to think more positively, have a bit, more confidence in my self, and felt like I genuinely self improved. That countied until a few days ago. I got rejected by someone I really cared about, and it didn't go well.

After farther reflection, I haven't made progress on any of the goals I set to fix myself, even though I put in all my effort. My little confidence I gained is shattered. For the last few days, I have though about sueicde a lot, to the point where I don't go into work anymore because there is no point. That friend I had has moved up in life, to the point where I feel if I reach out to him I will just be a burden anyways. I am not close to my family at all, and if they knew I was depressed they would tell me to suck it up. I don't believe in religion, it's likely we live in a computer simulation so nothing will matter if I go.

birthday blues,"I turn twenty-two soon and things are falling apart. I know I have it better than a lot of people— I have so much to be grateful for. I try to remember those things and keep them front and center. It’s a big year for me and there are so many due dates, deadlines and things to do— But I can hardly bring myself to get out of bed. I just don’t know what the point is, what the end goal is. I feel the only things really keeping me here is my sweet little cat and my mother. I just can’t shake this strange feeling that I am an outsider in everything I do and everywhere I go. I am tired of it and I just want it to stop. 

I feel guilty for existing. It’s like imposter syndrome but for being a person. I feel as though I don’t have the abilities needed to make my dreams come true, to be genuinely loved by someone, to be resilient enough to withstand the heartache I feel now and the heartache that is inevitably to come. I feel too old to still be self harming and feeling like a ghost. I feel like I don’t exist already, but somehow I’m still here.

Little ways to revitalize your routine.,"Recently, I've realized just how important variety and freshness is in everyday life. I know that many of the tips I will list below are not possible when you are in a particularly dark place, but I thought I'd mention them anyway — perhaps something will be of help to you. Here are a few things that help me keep overwhelming bouts of anxiety and ideation at bay: 

* Push yourself to wake up a little earlier. Stretch slowly with deep breaths and take a walk around your neighborhood as the sky turns rosy-yellow. Try to appreciate the new day; think of something, anything, to look forward to. Return home for a  warm shower and freshly-laundered clothes.
* Sleep a little bit earlier. Wash your sheets and buy a few soft blankets to make your bed into a cozy sanctuary. Allot time for reading or journalling to clear your mind.
* Allot time to cook simple, lovely meals. Steam fresh vegetables, cook some rice, or cut up a fruit salad of apples, bananas, and citrus. Eat mindfully and drink plenty of water. 
* Buy a well-bound journal and a good quality pen. Write down achievable to-do lists, make calendars, note groceries, thoughts, haikus —  anything. Put your thoughts in ink; appreciate daily observations. 
* Reorganize your space, or at least a little section of it. Listen to a nice podcast as you do so. Put your sheets and pillowcase into the laundry. Clear out your shelves and drawers, sort through everything, and replace it all neatly. Light a lovely candle and add some fresh flowers. Open a window or two.
* Buy or borrow a book on any topic which sparks even the slightest interest. Crocheting? Botany? Medieval history? Delving into a new topic just for the sake of it is worthwhile.
* Embrace non-competitive hobbies. This is incredibly important in a product(ivity)-obsessed society which devalues craftsmanship and pure interests. Activities like the following enrich your daily life and force you to set aside some time away from mandatory tasks: needle-felting, gardening, writing (poems, books, articles, blogs), painting, photography, wood-whittling, typography, graphic design, etc. Ensure that whatever you choose, the hobby involves holding the  fruits of your labor in your hands. You do not have to be ""good"" at it –  this is not a career choice. Watching yourself grow and have fun with  it is success in and of itself.

I hope you are doing well — I'm glad you are here, reading this.

I am the most destructive person to myself and the ones I love. Everyday looks the same, I go to school, I work, I procrastinate, I stress, I cry, I sleep, I repeat. Every. Day. Is. The.

And school makes it IMPOSSIBLE for me to enjoy literally fucking ANYTHING. I NEVER in my whole life felt this depressed, even though I survived an suicide attempt a few years ago, that doesn’t compare to the depression I am feeling right now and it’s scary. After all these years of therapy I am doing even worse. I just want to lie in my bed and fall asleep and never wake up again.

"Feeling like there’s no point, scared of the future.","I just feel like it’s always something with me. I’m not doing anything big or exciting or impactful. I’m turning 25 in a few days, I’m married to a good man who loves me but we’ve struggled with communication and compatibility so we’ve been in therapy working on it. It’s hard work. He’s worth it, I love him, I’m in love with him, he’s my best friend and partner, but I didn’t think it would be this hard. Nobody talks about how hard being a couple is, it’s all “it shouldn’t be hard with the right person” and that makes me feel like a failure. I feel like a failure in everything in my life. I can’t keep a job, I’m currently unemployed and have no skills or qualifications in anything that is even remotely interesting to me. I hate not contributing financially and we’re struggling. We can barely eat right now, it’s humiliating. And it’s my fault. I struggle with infertility, all we want is to start our family. I can’t even do that. I never finished college and I have the debt to remind me every day. It’s not going to get easier. I’m an adult. Nothing significant is going to change and make things easier. I’ll never have the life I dream of, so what’s the point?

I’ve overcome so much with anxiety and OCD. But it’s still here and it really burns me out sometimes. I keep thinking about my future and how scary it is to age. I’m not afraid of dying, but I’m afraid of ceasing to exist if that makes sense. Who will be there at the end? Will I get sick? Will my husband? We could be in accidents, I could lose him to something traumatic, anything could happen. How do people live their whole lives? Becoming 40 feels so unrealistic.

Despresso,"Hi, I am having a v intense realization that I’ve been depressed for a very long time. Though you wouldn’t think that if you met me. Every day I slap on a smile and ask myself, “what kind of beauty am I going to see today?” and I allow life to flow. People say I’m so nice and so happy, so fun and charming. I had gotten so good at it I had even convinced myself for the passed 10yrs that I’ve been happy. Truth is though I don’t think I’d know happiness if it hit me in the face. 
I think I’ve been depressed since young childhood, coming from a wildly dysfunctional military home, being constantly bullied, I turned to sex drugs and alcohol at a very young age in order to cope. Now I’m 25, in a big city, feeling more isolated than ever. I work two jobs, I was going to university but decided to drop out to do a trade. I decided to be poly because I felt so lonely in monogamous relationships but poly has been nothing but heartache. I live with a close friend who doesn’t clean at all and constantly has his girl friend over even tho he works nights and she has her own apartment. I don’t know how to set boundaries because no one has ever respected them. I’ve been in and out of therapy (currently out but I guess almost back in). I’ve been assaulted and abused. My cat has never cuddled me. I don’t know how to make deep connections with people or how to keep friendships. Then I think about the state of the world and feel so helpless and hopeless. There is no point. I fantasize about dying every single day, I think about ending my life every single day. I am so incredibly miserable, I’m so incredibly tired.

I think I will be alone forever,"After being in such a long, unhealthy and abusive relationship, I have been dating again. 

At first I was optimistic. At this point, after so many dates that went nowhere, I don't think I will ever find someone to be with for the rest of my life. I haven't felt like I really clicked with anyone. The men who seem to have the right qualities aren't interested in me.   

Nobody normal is interested in dating a disabled person, even when it's an invisible disability. Even being attractive can't overcome that. I have no career because I got sick. Nobody wants to deal with that. 

I'm tired of seeing everyone else in happy marriages with families. It just reminds me that I'm not good enough and won't ever be. I'd rather just die than be alone for the rest of my life.

I have a lot of great qualities and a lot of love to give. Just no one to share any of it with. I feel like today might be a bad day for me. Hopefully I can keep myself from ending it all.",lonelylavender,6,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/fec9vu/i_think_i_will_be_alone_forever/,long unhealthy abusive relationship dating first wa optimistic point many date went nowhere think ever find someone rest life felt like really clicked anyone men seem right quality interested nobody normal interested dating disabled person even invisible disability even attractive overcome career got sick nobody want deal tired seeing everyone else happy marriage family reminds good enough ever rather die alone rest life lot great quality lot love give one share feel like today might bad day hopefully keep ending,think alone forever,lonely lavender

It’s not okay.,"The other day I realised that how I felt wasn’t just my pain it was my mother’s too. 

I haven’t felt suicidal for about a year now, in fact after recent medical problems all I’ve wanted to do is live a normal life. I have always been a sad person, naturally and I suppose this can take a toll on the people around you but it was only the other night that I saw just how much it could. 

Every night my mother stands outside my door and says “Goodnight love you sweet pea” to which I ALWAYS reply. Except this night I had a headache so I forgot about staying up later than my parents so I could check all the doors were locked. Instead at around 9 I went to sleep. About half an hour and a half later when my mum was going to bed I woke to see her standing at my door. I was half asleep so I said “I’m trying to sleep” and she apologised and went to bed

The next morning I questioned her on why she stood at my door and she said “Every night I say goodnight and it’s not just to remind you it’s for me to check you’re still alive but last night you didn’t respond and I went to go to bed but I stopped went back an said goodnight through the door again and you didn’t answer so I opened the door and thought oh she’s asleep but then as I walked a way a voice in my head said you were dead so I stood at your door waiting to see you breathe. 

The point is even though I moved on and that I haven’t felt depressed for over a year my mother still does every single day. No mother should have to worry like that. It’s not selfish and I’m not saying that I’m just saying that it’s not okay.",Lorelai-Diormand,1,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/febvty/its_not_okay/,day realised felt pain wa mother felt suicidal year fact recent medical problem wanted live normal life always sad person naturally suppose take toll people around wa night saw much could every night mother stand outside door say goodnight love sweet pea always reply except night headache forgot staying later parent could check door locked instead around 9 went sleep half hour half later mum wa going bed woke see standing door wa half asleep said trying sleep apologised went bed next morning questioned stood door said every night say goodnight remind check still alive last night respond went go bed stopped went back said goodnight door answer opened door thought oh asleep walked way voice head said dead stood door waiting see breathe point even though moved felt depressed year mother still doe every single day mother worry like selfish saying saying okay,okay,lorelai dior

There is nothing left of me,"This is my first ever post on reddit. A friend of mine said I should post here and I’ve been finding every excuse not to but I am afraid that I have nothing left so why not? Here goes....I’ve literally given everything I have to my marriage and I’m not getting anything in return. We have 4 amazing children together  and they are everything to me but often times I feel like it’s only a matter of time before they realize I’m not worth their time and they too move on from me. I found out my wife was cheating on me and for some reason I still wanted to work things out with her. Well fast forward 4 months later and things are happening with another guy. Every confrontation about it is basically flipped and I’m made to feel like this is all my fault. I’ve never cheated on her and I’ve never thought about it a single time. I’m feeling so low that I don’t want to be here anymore. I feel like a stranger in my own home. People tell me to think of my children but what good is that when you truly believe they will be better off without you? I’m not worth trying to make a marriage work so why would I be worth it to them? They didn’t even choose me. I attempted suicide before, just before Christmas. My sister-in-law found me and called 911 and I ended up in a hospital for a week. I promised I would never let that happen again but I just can’t help the thoughts coming back.

Suicidal thoughts. Please help if you can.,"For a few months it's been overwhelming. I've lost multiple friends in the last two months alone due to how I act. I dont think I'm exactly wrong, but I only kept about 2 to 3 friends and now they just wont contact me. I feel insignificant contacting them because I've only gotten a response once or twice. I'm falling out of my work schedule, every night thinking of how I would end myself until i realize I'm thinking about it. The past six months have been so hard on me, and I'm only 20. I know i have many years more to live but it feels so hopeless as i think that I'm gonna die one day, why keep feeling like this forever? I feel like I have no hold over my life, I cant stay in one place for long, much less keep a steady job. In the moment I just say fuck it and quit and move on to another, I dropped out and am an alcoholic. I cant clean because it feels hopeless as well, everything just piles up until I'm at this point, and this time i dont know if i can move on. My dreams are repetitive and of the same person, and i cant shake that no matter what i try. Right now just seems like the time to save my family the pain of doing it later and just ending it.

I'm going to be a bad mom anyway so I may as well die.,"I had a baby recently and regret ever getting pregnant so much. My PTSD is back after giving birth full force and my life is unlivable. My body is ruined. Maybe i'm stupid but I didn't know it would destroy my body or I would have aborted. And I know that's horrible and sounds super vain. But it's not vain. I don't care how i look in clothes or what other people think of how I look. I just need to feel comfortable in my body and like it belongs to me. And I don't. As a result I can't not wear a bra even in my own home because I have so much anxiety about it. Even if it's just me and the baby at home. So i'm always uncomfortable. If someone rings the buzzer i jump and scream. I can't let my partner see my body at all. The thought sends me into a panic attack. So we can't shower together, I sleep fully clothed, I have to go to a different room to change and close the door. No sex ever again. I know he's just going to hate me one day and leave anyway because me being so messed up will drive him away. I can't live my life like this. I can't be a mom like this. 

I'm waiting to talk to my therapist again on Monday to explain it all and see if he can help with the PTSD. I have ppd too but that's not even a big deal. I have had PTSD and depression all my life. I can cope with some moderate depression. But these body issues I will never be able to get over. 

I'm waiting to see how my body ""settles"" but that's going to take 6 months to 2 years. If I can't live with it i'm going to kill myself. I can't live the rest of my life like this in agony every day. It's only been 2 months but I don't know how much longer I can wait.

because of this i fell off on my school work last semester and failed more than half of my modules which means my sponsor cutting me off, but i cant afford to pay on my own.

Feeling like I'm just passing time until I die,"By nature of my mental health conditions, I'm someone who doesnt really have any aspirations in life and even if I did I wouldnt have the energy or stability to achieve it, as has proven to be the case in the past. I wouldnt say im depressed but more just apathetic and accepting of the thought that nothing will change, that this is as good as it gets. I've experienced all that I've wanted to experience so what more is there to do except wait to die? 

Im not interested in marriage, children or any type of career. I just spend all day sleeping, eating and watching TV which is getting boring after doing it for several years. It wouldnt be so bad if I could enjoy some of my solitary hobbies that I used to enjoy but now I just pick something up and then lose interest within a few minutes. It just feels like I'm delaying the inevitable at this point as I dont know how many more years I can put up with doing the same old crap until something other than myself kills me.

I feel guilty for thinking it but I just wish that my 2 family members that I'm close to would die just so that I can't feel guilty in my last moments about leaving them with grief. Then again, I know it'd be a relief for them in a way knowing that I wont be hopelessly trying to survive without them in this life. It's becoming easier to see the potential positives to me killing myself compared to the negatives. 

What's worse is that I'm transgender and have completed my transition (F&gt;M) but rather than it being a lease of life, its become more like a 'phew, at least now I can die in peace' type of situation. So theres a peaceful element involved now which makes it all the more tempting.

At the end of this year i planned to kill myself but i dont think im gonna make it.,"For the last 7 years ive had horrible stomach problems, i throw up atleast 4 days every week, i feel nauseous constantly, i have a ton of pain in my stomach, and after all these years ive gotten so malnourished and worn out that every part of my body is in pain. Ive seen numerous Gi specialists who have all told me that im in perfect health, despite their best efforts nothing they have tried has ever worked. The last specialist i saw basically told me that everything had been tried and there was nothing left for him to do, he gave me a few meds to try but they didnt help at all. Ive been seeking help with my mental health for over 5 years but in the end everyone ive seen has either dismissed me immediately or kicked me out after a year of not helping. The last time i tried to get help i ended up getting seen for maybe 5 minutes then told i had mild depression and given a recommendation to take back to my GP. The final nail in the coffin was yesterday when i went to see an ENT after over a year of waiting, ive had what i thought was sinusitis but just like every other doctor he told me i was perfectly healthy and that he couldnt help me. Honestly the ""sinus infection"" was the one thing i thought i actually understood but now that even that isnt real my mind just feels shattered. I thought i could atleast make it through the year, hopefully see another specialist and try even more tests but now i just cant see the point. All its going to bring is more frustration and depression, i feel like i should just do everyone a favor and kill myself. Everyone would be much better off without a piece of shit like me around, i know my parents would be upset for a while but in the end they would be far more happy if i was gone.

Committing Emotional Suicide,"Hello, I genuinely want to die. It’s been like this for months now (it somehow only grew worse), and I really thought antidepressants would magically cure me, but I haven’t been feeling much of a difference.

I can’t kill myself because of the emotional toll it would have on my family, so if I can’t do that, what can I do?

I think the next best thing is to commit “emotional suicide”. Living each day being practically dead, yet somehow alive. I’ve been trying so hard to get better, but every fibre of my being wants to die.

If I lived each day being a zombie, with little to no emotions, I think it would be better than feeling constant dread.

I don’t even know anymore, I just deeply loathe myself, but I don’t know what to do. I’m even supposed to be at school right now, but I felt extremely shitty, and couldn’t even manage to muster up a shred of self-esteem to present myself at school.",starry-night-230,5,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/fec6gn/committing_emotional_suicide/,hello genuinely want die like month somehow grew worse really thought antidepressant would magically cure feeling much difference kill emotional toll would family think next best thing commit emotional suicide living day practically dead yet somehow alive trying hard get better every fibre want die lived day zombie little emotion think would better feeling constant dread even know anymore deeply loathe know even supposed school right felt extremely shitty even manage muster shred self esteem present school,committing emotional suicide,starry night 230
Is it really such a bad thing?,"Hey, this is really weird for me and I wouldn’t normally do something like this but I don’t really know what else to do. Ever since I was a little kid I have thought life was pretty pointless and I kinda just wanted to die. As I grew up it gradually got worse and at this point I seriously just want to kill myself. I don’t have a bad life or anything I have just been searching for so long and I’ve never found a reason to want to be here. I have always had a problem making friends, I am always there for people and I love being able to help people, people just don’t like me. It could be a perception thing tho. In any case, I just spent two years with someone who I believe to be one of the most amazing people in the world, I loved him so much and genuinely thought I would spend the rest of my life with him but he broke up with me. He told me he was never happy with me and it broke me. I have met millions of people and I don’t believe I will ever be happy with someone like I was with him. I can’t be happy without him and he can’t be happy with me but to be his friend and see him happy with someone else would tear me to pieces. Everyone says I’ll move on and be happy again but it’s been months and it still feels fresh as the day it happened. The only reason I am still here is because of my mom. She guilt trips me into not committing suicide even though she has also always been suicidal. She also doesn’t believe in therapy and thinks making your bed will make the depression go away. The idea of killing my self isn’t scary to me and I know the people in my life will be sad but I am not enough of anything to anyone for it to be a big deal. Idk why I’m posting this, guess I’m just wondering what other people think about it.",Sp0ng3bl0b,0,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/fegrkj/is_it_really_such_a_bad_thing/,hey really weird normally something like really know else ever since wa little kid thought life wa pretty pointless kinda wanted die grew gradually got worse point seriously want kill bad life anything searching long never found reason want always problem making friend always people love able help people people like could perception thing tho case spent two year someone believe one amazing people world loved much genuinely thought would spend rest life broke told wa never happy broke met million people believe ever happy someone like wa happy without happy friend see happy someone else would tear piece everyone say move happy month still feel fresh day happened reason still mom guilt trip committing suicide even though ha also always suicidal also believe therapy think making bed make depression go away idea killing self scary know people life sad enough anything anyone big deal idk posting guess wondering people think,really bad thing,sp 0 ng 3 bl 0 b
"It’s Friday, and you need to read this.","Today’s the day to get out of bed! Get off that couch, or get the hell out of that chair, y’all. Start by sitting up wherever you are right this second. 

Right now, I want you to take a deep breath in through your nose, and slowly breathe it out through your mouth. Take another deep breath in, this time focus on the roof of your mouth and your tongue; relax those muscles, let your tongue fall away from the roof of your mouth, and breathe all the way out. Repeat this breathing technique, focusing further on your lungs and your rib cage. Feel each breath slowly touching your nostrils, pulling downward into your chest, filling your lungs. Consider your posture now, letting your shoulders roll back and your neck pull up as your lungs fill with fresh air. 

Your body is likely sore from sleeping too much, or not enough, and I know that story all too well. 

You’re alive today, and I challenge you to stand up, stretch the body your mind has been neglecting, and get into the shower.

Boyfriend had suicide plan,"I've never posted before but I feel at a loss and can't seem to find anything online similar so figured I'd post. 
Bit of backstory my boyfriend (5 years) had called me while I was at work on Monday saying that he was checking himself into a mental health hospital. I knew roughly why he would be there but it was still such a shock to me. It wasnt until a few days later that he opened up to me and said that he had made a plan and chose out the weapon but decided after his therapy session that he didnt want to do it anymore. So it's a weird in between spot. While he didnt necessarily attempt suicide he was damn close. Closer than I ever could have imagined.
I had just started a new job with a bakery about a month ago and then this happened. I've had a hard time coping with everything and so I told my boss I probably wouldn't be back until the following Monday. Fast forward to Friday I get a call from one of my friends who helped get me the job and she's saying that my work team is trying to be understanding but that they think and my friend thinks I'm being immature and irresponsible for not going to work. My friend even went far enough to say that maybe I wasn't strong enough for my boyfriend since I couldn't find it in myself to go to work through this. 
I guess I'm asking for advice. My friend said my work is talking about cutting my hours since now I've shown I'm not reliable even though before this happened I had never so much as shown up late before or called out. What would you do? I feel at a loss because yes I realize I should be working but I don't know how to face my work after this especially knowing they are annoyed with me.",smendy517,1,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/feg91y/boyfriend_had_suicide_plan/,never posted feel loss seem find anything online similar figured post bit backstory boyfriend 5 year called wa work monday saying wa checking mental health hospital knew roughly would wa still shock wasnt day later opened said made plan chose weapon decided therapy session didnt want anymore weird spot didnt necessarily attempt suicide wa damn close closer ever could imagined started new job bakery month ago happened hard time coping everything told bos probably back following monday fast forward friday get call one friend helped get job saying work team trying understanding think friend think immature irresponsible going work friend even went far enough say maybe strong enough boyfriend since find go work guess asking advice friend said work talking cutting hour since shown reliable even though happened never much shown late called would feel loss yes realize working know face work especially knowing annoyed,boyfriend suicide plan,mendy 517

everything is awful and I can't afford to be alive,"Howdy. I don't know why I'm posting like it's going to do anything for me but whatever. This is gonna be pretty wordy. A fella out here fighting the long fight. Everything's shit. Everything's been shit since I was like 11. There hasn't been a day in at least 5-6 years that suicide hasn't crossed my mind. I've managed to stay pretty functional. Less so now. I can't do anything. I'm used to having bad days. I'm used to that. But for the longest time my bad days were maximum 17 hours in bed then I get up to piss or something. It's different now. My bad days are 31 hours in bed no food or water. I don't go online, I don't talk to anyone, I just sulk. Everything's gone to shit. 

My family is big against any sort of therapy/mental illness sort of talk. I was too. Last year in August I broke down and started therapy because I knew I was slacking. I decided If not to change my mood, then to at least change my behavior. It helped for a while. Cut to December. I'm off my shit. I break down again and resort to meds. I've always been against meds for myself so idk maybe that adds some perspective. I felt like meds were the equivalent of me giving up my personality, becoming the masses. Pretentious I know but whatever. Meds don't do shit. I've had so many appointments with my psychiatrist to change my meds or the dosage but nothing has worked and it's been too long. 

I decided to go into an outpatient program in February. Things were really bad. I started disassociating very intensely. I can't feel my body move, I can't control my motions. It's one of the most terrifying things I've ever experienced. I went through the application process and got accepted into outpatient care. I was finally going to get thorough help. Confidentiality had been broken, relationships irreparable but I was going to do what I needed to do. The day I start I find out my insurance doesn't cover it.

I am so fucking tired of being too poor. I'm tired. It's so fucking humiliating to not be able to take care of yourself because you can't afford it. When I grew up everyone thought I was gonna be the kid to escape this shit. To break the cycle and actually make something of myself and be content. I was smart, I was bilingual and inventive and passionate and I learned about how to best fight my circumstances. I really thought I had a chance. But I don't.

There's no escaping the cycle of poverty. It comes back to bite no matter what you do.  My grades suffered because I didn't have a computer, or internet, or because I was losing my apartment or whatever the crisis might've been at the time. My grades are shit now, like a 1. something gpa. I can't get a scholarship and to be totally fucking honest I'm not sure I'd even graduate high school. I'm a financial drain on all my guardians. My mom won't buy me food, my dad is trying to not lose his other kid, and my grandma (who raised me) is forced to live with my dad and pay off the house because he can't afford it and knew he could leech off of her. I can't work because I'm already failing all my classes and I'm supposed to fix that.

The worst part is being aware of my situation. I can't afford to be healthy. I can't afford to be educated. I can't afford to be happy. How fucked up is that? I don't try and paint myself as the victim of this dumb ass capitalist society but come ON. It doesn't matter how I play the game. It doesn't matter how hard I try and be better. I can't pay for it. If I keep going, then in 10 years I'm gonna be a deadbeat working three jobs in some toxic relationship just like every other adult in my life. 

I can't have a life. I can't pay for it. If I kill myself that's like max a $7000 funeral. I have about a thousand and my family probably wouldn't spend that much anyway. Hell, if I can get rid of the body they won't even have to deal with that. No more food expenses, no more school expenses, no more health expenses. They can sell my shit, rent out my room, i don't care: I'll be fucking dead what do I need all this shit for? I can't keep up. Every time I turn a corner there's some new crisis to be dealt with. I can't keep doing this.

Relapsed,"Ive been going pretty good for some time.  
Got a flat, got a job, stayed clean for an almost year (except cigs and beers why I try limit as much as i can).  
I even had established morning routine before job like exercising and meditations. I were even writing daily journal which helped me a lot with memory and thinking. Exercising proved to be excelent whenever my attention started to go jumpy. I was going to sleep at exact time and woke a exact time same. It wasnt exactly perfect but it was better then before.   


And then i dont know  what happened. Guess its the freaking weather and loneliness along with overthinking that got me back into this moodiness.  
I guess I kind off hoped my father and mother would be freaking proud of me to stop dragging people into the same hole i was in and using.  
that they would be proud i found the job and keep it , that i try  even through i have health complications. But none of it happened. They each have their own families and im just a waste with no one to talk to except for my therapist and girlfriend. And I dont even know how to grateful to at least have someone since they dont understand how I am feeling.  
I just sit home trying to live someones else life inside comics and playing the same game over and over again even through i hate it. Trying to find a way to get away with assisted suicide because I cant do a shit right.  
Most depressing thing I realized is that it doesnt really matter how much i try to change myself. People instenctively hate me. That it doesnt matter if i try to live ""normal"" life. it still sucks. It doesnt matter if am clean or not , since no one cares. Everywhere i go theres this black cloud of my negativity transfering my bad ""mojo"" onto other people. Im burden to my gf since im most of the last month only sad piece of shit that cant do nothing to make this life better. Im burden even to her friends who took a pity on my cause im depressed shit.  
It doesnt even matter if i would die. No one cares a one piece of shit. All gonna be friends till I had money and drugs , they called adn talked about their problems , but now when im down theres no one.  
Im just waiting till dignitas answer me with mail so I can start preparing to leave this shitty hole called reality.   
Ive been trough so much.. Be it Abusive childhood, Abusive ex, Depressions since I was 11, Bullying, Drug addiction , anxieties, agoraphobia, so called ""desilusions"", Fake friends who destroyed any bit of my ability to trust a different human being, Being forced by a girl to almost having sex when i was 6, Constant Isolations ,School failures, being scapegoated, being hospitalised , tried to kill myself 3 times, Being left on my own my whole life with no support from my so called parents who just made everything worse. I cant get over it.   
I keep hearing all those bullshits like ""just change your thinking man"". How the heck am i supposed to change something that has been hardwired into my head for years when i was still a child.  


Id love to make comics, Id love to make music but i cant do anything else except for reading and playing over and over again , cause i have no energy to do anything. Worst part is I can hear laughing all the people I know. And even worse part is I know no one will answer this post again , cause theres just no other way than to ends this miserable piece of shit thats called my life.  
I hate all those people who think Assisted-suicide/Euthanasia shouldnt be avaible to people with mental illness. It is like saying ""people with cancer doesnt deserve to die a calm way.""  


All my life i was trying to be better.. To help people around me.. And it cost me dearly.  
It really brought me down when I realized it doesnt matter. It doesnt matter i tried to save my mom from alcoholic, It just made things worse for me. It doesnt matter I tried to cheer people [up.It](https://up.It) doesnt matter Im clean. I dont know how to form this sentence , so ill just say it doesnt matter how hard I try. It always come back and i have to start again. But im tired of reabulding and rebuilding again and again.

Nobody gives a crap about me.,I’ve lost all my friends over the past year. Got dumped by me gf last year. Nobody checks up on me. Girls don’t even wanna talk to me. I’m so lonely.

I’ve prepared but I’m rethinking,"So I made this account so I could post without being known. I’ve prepared for my end in a way. I’m the only caretaker for my mom and it’s exhausting. I’ve given up having a childhood a long time ago and all my major moments in life from periods to dating has been done on my own. I have a lot of siblings but all are married and were gone before I reached high school. My dad was always in a sense abusive, mostly if I did something wrong in his eyes I was yelled at, slapped, etc. even now. Just yesterday he got frustrated because he got a phone call about work and in his frustration he grabbed the nearest thing and threw it at me. Which caused my hand to be bloody. I have a boyfriend, well had, who’s the absolute sweetest and the other day I broke up with him. I wanted him to not be hurt when I make the choice to go. He was the only goodbye I needed to make. I’m just so tired. So worn out. I want to stop being a burden and a drag down. If I’m gone my dad can finally know I’m not a disappointment because then I wont be alive to be one. Then this morning a video popped up, it was talking about there’s still a chance to get past this. If I go through it’ll be my 5th and last attempt. I think my boyfriend (ex) has figured out I’m going to do it. He keeps begging me not to. I want to do this to stop hurting people, I want to stop feeling hurt. I can’t seek help because in my culture from church and everything that means that you’d be completely turned away by the whole community. I’m just unsure of where to go.

I don’t see the point.,"I don’t even know what I want from posting this, but I am at my limit. There’s too much going on in my life to deal with and I feel like it would just be a burden to explain at this point. The main thing is, I can’t handle it. I’m 19 and in college and I can’t find a reason to get out of bed anymore. I don’t find joy in anything, not even drawing, reading, or video games. I hate being alive and the only thing that’s kept me here is my boyfriend. I’m starting to resent him because of it and I despise that. I don’t know what to do. I went on a long walk and took a break from writing this and I’m still as lost as ever. I couldn’t even think straight, my mind just jumps from useless thing to useless thing. It’s like it doesn’t stop. I stopped taking my medicine and that’s obviously contributing to how I feel, but I felt hopeless before I stopped taking it too. Everyone treats me like I’m lazy and I’m not trying hard enough.

"Reasons Why (trigger warning: rape, self harm, sexual assault)","- Chronic pain from TMJ (I can’t even eat, eat mushy or liquid foods), can’t talk or sing much anymore, just lay in bed and sleep to escape pain 

- Chronic sinus infections (I can’t breathe, always feel like I’m about to sneeze, eyes swollen shut half the day)

- I try to be a kind person the best I can. I’ve never yelled at a stranger or friend or boyfriend. I’ve never cheated. I’m not clingy. I support everyone with everything they do, and I give people hundreds of chances to change. I make food for people. If someone has a problem, even a random person who hasn’t been the nicest, I will talk to them and try to give them solutions. I try to put out good karma into this world. I know I won’t be here much longer, so might as well make a positive impact. I try to not be stepped on either though. 

- Chronic inflammation and skin conditions (acne, eczema, every pore on my leg is purple and inflamed, eyelids are always inflamed and crusty and often swollen completely shut, family thinks I exaggerate these symptoms and that I just naturally look swollen and red or whatever)

- Zero friends. Not exaggerating. Not one friend. Never had a close friend before. I’ve had depression ever since I’m 10. I text some people occasionally but no one I’m close to who I can share my feelings or hang out with.

- Was raped. No one acknowledged, and when they did realize, told me to be more picky with my sexual partners. I couldn’t have been more picky. I was passed out.

- Not in school (even though I had a 4.2 GPA and 1550 SAT). Was homeschooled 10-12th grade high school. Went to liberal arts college in another state has manic/psychotic episodes had to go back home. Started community college but parents pulled me out during my depressive episode.

- No trust in men. I can never have a normal relationship. Besides being raped, I had men bombard me with videos of porn stars and detail why I wasn’t as hot as them, inspect me for flaws, take advantage of my past trauma as part of their kink, lie to me about being married, tell me that the only reason they like me is because I’m psycho or dumb, etc. I shouldn’t have been dating during this bad time. During my Klonopin withdrawal period, I had a panic attack and a guy just drove away.

- OCD thoughts nonstop. I’m scared of even thinking certain thoughts. I’m convinced certain thoughts or not having certainty thoughts will jinx my future. I’m scared I’m a sexual deviant (even though I have no libido and am a straight vanilla female with only 2 sexual partners ever 3 including rape). I’m convinced I’m becoming a hermaphrodite, or that I’m actually transgender. Weird thoughts.

- Eating disorder. Scared of being fat, also scared of being skinny. I just want to look ill. I don’t want to look like a girl that men fetishize. Look small and thin and pedophiles will want to rape me. Look curvy and I’ll be objectified. I can’t stop bingeing and purging. I was underweight then a guy was checking me out now I want to become fat.

- Mom harassed me for my nude photos. She imitated how I took the photos, this is what drove me to attempt suicide. She showed them to my dad and sister and now everyone thinks I’m a slut and my sister tells my cousin about how I sleep with many men on the first date. 

- Blatant preferential treatment for my sister. She gets her laptop fixed, I don’t. She gets haircuts, I don’t. While I was getting a seizure from Klonopin withdrawals, my mom was shopping for a custom coat for my sister for hours and when I told my mom what happened she said something like “oh that’s not nice.”

- Hundreds of people know my diagnosis and think I’m crazy. My sister had a fundraiser for mental illness to help her get into a good college and to make it more inspirational she shared my health information with many people who now treat me weird.

- Everyone outside our family like extended family and family friends also are super patronizing and treat me as this person you want to be cordial with but also not get close to and are super patronizing 

I need someone to talk to so badly. I’ve felt this way for so so so long. No one cares. I feel invisible. I swear I can tell aloud that I want to kill my self and no one would care. I wish someone could ask me if I’m ok. I’ve asked other people so many times if they’re ok can’t remember the last time I’ve been asked that.

Anyone else totally fucked?,"I wanted to die starting in Jan 2018, but things have only gotten worse.

In summer 2018, those fucks on the Suicide Prevention chatroom called the police when I expressed suicidal ideations, so I was kidnapped and sent to a series of hospital-prisons with junk medical staff. I lost my job due to the hospital stay - and my apartment, car, and dog shortly followed.

Can't get a decent job because my resume is now all fucked up and I have no connections, and I refuse to go back to miserable jobs that pay horribly. I'd rather die than do that for life.

I am about to be sued on $4K debt, and then yesterday I was handed a $6.5K medical bill for treatment that would have been 100% unnecessary had I still had insurance and was able to go to regular check ups.

You fucks on the Suicide Prevention line made my life demonstrably worse. You destroyed the mechanisms that kept me going as an independent and self-sufficient human. Now I have nothing and am in a far worse position (logistically speaking) to be dealing with any of this.

Right now I'm sort of just waiting until where I'm currently staying kicks me out, which should be soon. After that, it's time to die.

I am this close,"I maintain this cheery personality but in reality, I'm just barely getting along. No one cares about me, and I don't want to attempt suicide (for the third time). The first two attempts sucked, and I hate myself everyday for even trying. The first time, I lost nearly all of my memories from the past (retrograde amnesia), so I couldn't recognize most people that I knew. The second time was at a hospital and I was placed on suicide watch. Needless to say, my parents were/are scared ASF.

I use drugs to cope. Weed, Adderall, lean, alcohol, Xanax, Ambien, and LSD.

"Pooh, Piglet, and Eeyore","There's this thing that circles around my feed every once in a while, about how Eeyore is feeling low so he stays at his house instead of going out with Pooh and Piglet, so Pooh and Piglet go to his house, where Eeyore says he's not been hanging around with them because he's sad and low and not much fun to be around. So then Pooh and Piglet sit next to Eeyore and don't say anything, they just lend him their presence, with love and without judgment. And then, although he doesn't feel better, he \*does\* feel better.

I've got people like that, people who have straight up offered just to sit with me, who don't care how low I am or how un-fun I am to be with, they just love me. But the thing is, the thought of having someone just sit with me while I am dying inside -- I mean, I seriously can't even bear it. As much as I would be willing to do that for someone else, I simply cannot accept being on the receiving end of it.

Just cant seem to get ahead in life.,"I've always been a negative person in life.

Anyways the job is awesome, and I thought the homeless people would be hard to deal with, but no, it's no them, it's the coworker's that act like high school kids talking shit about the other coworkers. So I stay neutral when people say things about other people. We have this worker, and she's real mean to the  people. It's like you'll ask yourself why is she doing this kind of work if she hates people? She i feed this lady who gets to the shelter late, and the coworker gets mad at me since it was late.. she calls me a pushover, then I tell her, ""I'm not a pushover I just have compassion. And that makes her mad! So, she says sorry at first. Then wants to have the last.word with me. So, she goes off on me, and I go.off on her. She lies and says I threaten her, and I get sent home.

Is it selfish of me to want my friends to check up on me?,"I'm in my junior year of college and lately my depression has been getting to the point where i can't help but constantly think about either dying somehow or outright killing myself. I can tell that i'm isolating myself from all of my friends. I rarely answer texts and if i'm invited to go out, i either don't respond or make up an excuse. Lots of people have told me they miss seeing me but no one has considered asking me how i'm doing. I feel like i'm being selfish by wanting them to ask me how i am rather than going to them and talking about how badly i'm struggling to just go about my everyday life. I also don't want to go to them with this kind of thing because it's a pretty heavy topic to just bring up out of the blue and i don't want to scare anyone.

Life sucks and I think there's something wrong with me.,"Ever since I came to the States for college, I've just been in a depressive state of mind. School killed my passion for what I wanted to do with a shit ton of work and almost no free time to myself. I want to change schools/take a gap year, but I am unable to do that due to financial reasons. I don't have friends in school. I have classmates, but they feel more like coworkers who are just concerned about themselves and their own career, more than friends. My family doesn't feel like a family; it's a nightmare where everyone hates each other. 

I used to be a very optimistic guy with very little pessimism. But now, I feel like my pessimistic side has taken over me. I *think* that there's an inner voice that tells me that I should go ahead and kill myself because it's an easy solution to every single problem I have. I also noticed that I'm not being my original self anymore. I lose patience way faster than I used to, I get upset more easily, and so much more. I feel like I've lost my own self. I don't know who I am anymore. Everything seems pointless and nothing motivates me to work hard and live life anymore.

BUT I know I shouldn't act on suicide. I understand that it's wrong and selfish. And my reasons to suicide are not reasonable AT ALL. I keep telling myself that I'm just in a rough patch of life and it's just a small hill that I'd have to climb over. 

School, on the other hand, is just a lot of work. The stress piled up from the amount of work, family issues, financial concerns, **and** my depressive shit thoughts does not help at all. Further, my procrastination absolutely fucked me over this semester. I'm going to fail my classes and probably have to retake them. My parents are going to be crazy mad at me, yet I don't care for some reason. My concerns aren't at school, but at life itself.

I don't know what to do. I don't know what I should do. I can't tell if I became a lazy person and now I'm trying to justify my laziness or if this is just my body's response to a lot of stress accumulated over the years.

I hate the state of mind that I am in. I hate that I think too much.

Without a stable living situation and losing hope,"Just over a week ago I left a really shitty situation with parents who have treated me pretty awfully for years and I am finally free - however, I'm homeless. I have been staying with friends and I spend some time in crisis accommodation provided by my psychologist after I finally opened up to her about everything they have been doing to me, and it's just been really hard.

I'm having trouble getting the legal documents I need to secure a stable living situation, in my country so much of that is reliant on parental confirmation even though I am a legal adult, and I met up with my mum today to try and talk things out with her but I got brutalised and put down and just made to feel really worthless all over again. She couldn't even not be cruel to me after meeting for just one day after not seeing eachother for awhile, so I have decided to go no contact.

I feel really helpless. I feel like the systems in place quite literally fuck you over if you have abusive families, needing their birth certificates to verify things. I feel like it has been made near impossible for me to live independently without them but I know I can never go back because they have put me through so much trauma and so many things I know to not be okay and they have no remorse, and I'm never going to put up with that ever again.

Just in case...,"I'm an 18 year old with severe depression, anxiety, ADHD, borderline personality disorder and DID at a point in my life. But I'm slowly recovering.

I have always felt like I never belonged to this world, because I am ""too imaginative"" and ""too kind"". I behave ""not like how people should"". I'm mostly well-liked, but I know they think I'm a weirdo. Everyone does.

It's final exam time for us, and I have to secure good marks, otherwise I won't be able to enter any good streams in a good college. It would be the end of my future. My family is in a financial crunch, but they give up everything for me. I am dead-set on helping my friends get through their depression and suicidal tendencies, but I'm failing at that. I have had three attempts, but I was saved by a person, who himself was alexithymic (I think) and suicidal. He still is, and he says if he doesn't do well, he will commit suicide.

I don't know what I'm gonna do if I don't perform the way I should. But I certainly know that I will die if he does.

In case everything goes wrong, I'll leave. There's no other way. The day of my death is nearing. It's just 3 months away.

✅21yo ✅no school ✅ family hates me ✅ alcooholic,"Me : 21yo french garbage
My parents made me go to engineering school, far from their home in paris, after 3 years of preparatory in maths and physics . I immediatly hated the school, i  did a few entreprise visit with my class and i knew i didnt want to be an engineer. I d rather kill myself than becoming one engislave. I made really good friends in this city tho, even if i wasn't going to school anymore  at one point i was still very happy because of them.

So i told my parents i wanted to stop engineering school, that i wanted to get a job until next year when i will go study something i always dreamt about, becoming a doctor. I went back home for holidays, 3 weeks ago.

I have rough background story with my parents, i'm always in conflict with them and until last summer they always solved conflicts by hitting me or insulting me, saying horrible things that made me hate them. They did make me sleep outside for a few days when i was still a good student in preparatory class, they made me bleed several times, my dad with a sharped stick of wood and my mom with her nails.

I told them i wanted to get a job in the city i was studying, far from home, because i could be near my friends. I told them being home with them was torture, that it was making me go insane and suicidal. I'm still at their home rn, i have a job, but i still want to go live in this city, with my friends and my girlfriend who lives there and to get a job there. Nobody talks to me at home, they took my computer and my credit card. I cant go out, i cant see any friend nearby, i cant do anything or enjoy life. 

They want me stay here, no discussion possible. They make me want to kill myself, they repeating every time i talk about my friends that they don't care about me, that they think i'm a looser and  a piece of shit because i stopped this school.

I want to go to this city next week, but i dont have my appartment anymore. I don't know how to convince them to pay the rent for just one month, the time for me to get a job and be independent.",Drivax,17,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/fdzh7r/21yo_no_school_family_hates_me_alcooholic/,21yo french garbage parent made go engineering school far home paris 3 year preparatory math physic immediatly hated school entreprise visit class knew didnt want engineer rather kill becoming one engislave made really good friend city tho even going school anymore one point wa still happy told parent wanted stop engineering school wanted get job next year go study something always dreamt becoming doctor went back home holiday 3 week ago rough background story parent always conflict last summer always solved conflict hitting insulting saying horrible thing made hate make sleep outside day wa still good student preparatory class made bleed several time dad sharped stick wood mom nail told wanted get job city wa studying far home could near friend told home wa torture wa making go insane suicidal still home rn job still want go live city friend girlfriend life get job nobody talk home took computer credit card cant go cant see friend nearby cant anything enjoy life want stay discussion possible make want kill repeating every time talk friend care think looser piece shit stopped school want go city next week dont appartment anymore know convince pay rent one month time get job independent,21yo school family hate alcooholic,riva x

I want to tell my story. I want to be understood. I want to be remembered. Death is stalking us. Suicide or covid-19.  Car wreck  or cancer. Go out in a blaze or just simply die in  your sleep.   


I have suicidal ideations but i'm not sure if they are real or that it is just I see death  stalking me. Why kill myself?  No need.  Death is using the clues that i leave everywhere so that it can find me. 

&amp;#x200B;

It is blind. Death is blind. It just creeps around touching and feeling things until it finds it's prey and then it simply  taps you on the shoulder. Your left shoulder. Then it will whisper it's secret to you.  When you know death's secret, then you are dead. Everything beyond that is a secret.  It is the only secret in the history of the world that has ever been truly kept.    


The dead unswervingly serve their master.  No secrets told .  Death cannot be betrayed.  It cradled you before you born and  will hold you once again when you die. 

It isn't evil. It just IS. Everything just IS. 

I hope i am brave when I  finally feel that tap on my shoulder.  I want to greet death like an old friend because it is.  Death is our mother. It loves us unconditionally and will deny no one of it's love.  Oblivion is just fancy word eternal peace.   


We all want peace.  We want the  vibrations to subside and   when  the blur finally stops , we are left   with the secret we were told.  That secret that tells itself.     It wasn't such a  secret after all.

Anyone who wanna talk about it?," 

I am sorry for any error, english not my first language and I'm very anxious right now. It's a long story and it's kind of confusing, but here we go.

I am depressed since ever, I don't know when it started or how it started, the only thing that I know is that I am depressed since I was a kid and things is getting worse and worse. I was in big crisis in the last two years, life was not what I was expecting to be and things are so complicated, I tried, tried and I am still being fucked by things. So my cousin lives in another country and I asked her if I could stay with her for 3 months until things get better and I can organize myself to live here. So I moved here one month ago and I am trying to build things to live here. Maybe another country, another life maybe things get better, I don't know, I am trying.  
When I asked her if I can stay in her home she was really kind and supportive, it was in august/2019. Then I got here last month and she isn't nice at all. She wakes me up on purpose, she says bad things like ""I can watch my tv cause you are sleeping on the couch"" (the couch is ""my bed"" now). She insinuated that I should find a place for me since the day I arrived here. I try the most to help with things, I clean the house, I wash her clothes, I go the supermarket, I buy the food, I cook the food, I try to be outside the most so I give her a space. And still she's acting bad towards me. I don't know what to do since I asked her to be here for 3 months and after one month things are bad like this. The thing is that I feel so lonely right now and then I tried to talk with her yesterday and she was so mean, she say things like ""people are lonely"", ""grow up that life is hard"", ""cut off this depressed shit"" and others things really mean. The she got out and get really really really drunk with her friends and when she got home, she was another person, she was fun, making jokes, making me laugh, we watch a movie together and I was so fucked up with all the shit that I didn't sleep at all this night. Then she wakes up and starting a argument with me cause the dishes are dirty, but it was her, she used this last night when she was drunk, I tried to talk with her and she just said something like ""I hate that you here"". Now I am really confused. I know that I am not the asshole at all, but will I be the asshole if I kill myself now? I don't wanna kill myself because of her, I just wanna end it all cause I am so full of this shitty life.

I want to die because I am actually useless,"I got no talent whatsoever. I got nothing I want to do. I tried hard to search for what I can do and what I'm good at, just to find out I'm actually hopeless. That I have no fucking talent whatsoever. No motivation for anything as well. I'm a huge disappointment to everyone around me and it hurts. I love my friends and family, I want them to be proud of me, but there is nothing about me to be proud of. Until recently, I have tried my best with everything. Studying, socializing, classes I was taking, everything. I had the motivation of making my parents and friends proud. Of being a useful human being so they can love me. So I can be loveable. I lost that motivation recently. When my parents said that I am not good enough, said my younger sister is better than me and laughed. I got pissed and told them I was trying my best and they told me that I wasn't and that my result grades were the evidence. (I got 2 B's in math and social studies by 0.1 and 0.2 difference each, otherwise all A)They called me dumb and that they regret spending so much money on me if I was going to be this way, not working hard and not getting the best results. They said that I was acting depressed for no reason and I am whining about my life because I am spoiled. To break me completely my father said he is losing motivation to go to work and earn money because I am wasting it. Then my mother said I disappoint her. It is my fault that I couldn't get straight As on everything and I admit that I could have done better if I pushed myself harder, I admit that I should have done that but those words did hurt a lot for me. At that point, I still wanted to impress my friends but then my parents told me they won't want to hang out with me if I keep this up and continue being dumb, useless and not helpful. That made me feel like every effort I'm making is useless. Nobody ever told me I was doing a good job, my parents didn't compliment me whatsoever. I am done. I was diagnosed with depression and even then my parents never took me seriously saying that I lied. I want to be a loveable person and be loved. These days I have no motivation to do anything. I just want to die. May sound like I am whining, but my parent's validation were all I want and what I lived for until now.

Does anyone feel like the Universe has chosen you especially to make you suffer?,"First of all, sorry... I’m Brazilian and my english is broken.

I'm 26 years old, I think I'm beautiful and I look younger, but I've been in severe depression for over ten years because of family losses and my borderline disorder, and I think I was born mentally ill. I was hospitalized in 2016 and 2017 and under psychiatric treatment, but I think that I have no cure. 

I stopped going to university, I stopped working, everything goes wrong, but last year I thought everything was going to change. I met someone and helped him, gave him house, food, love and my family accepted him, but he made it worse, made me go through hell, left me at the rock bottom, and then this year he left, he left me!! Now he is living a happy life and I that helped him.. well I’m living in chaos. 

THAT'S NOT FAIR!  WHY EVERYTHING GOES WRONG IN MY LIFE?

Maybe its for the best that I don't live anymore,"I am almost 40, on disability morbidly obese and can't lose weight no matter how hard I try.   I am almost 40, with nothing but a 500 dollar laptop that my neighbor gave me that is falling apart and only worth around 70 if that. a pair of shoes that are falling apart and hurt when I walk in them. about a dozen worn-out socks and a few shirts and pants all black. mostly sweat pants and two pairs of blue jeans and a worn-out wallet that is falling apart on me. 

I am on disability getting less than 800$ USD a month and have no educational background no GED was homeless for over 8 years and have bad teeth because of it. some need fixing and one needs a new crown. I wasn't taught dental hygiene until I became homeless and even then brushing and flossing was the least of my worries. it was more of getting food and trying to survive. 

I spent the past few years trying to get my GED and failed even with tutors and teachers and study groups found out I have learning issues that make it hard for me to get my GED and I basically have to go from the 2nd and 3rd grade to 12th grade in every subject.

I have no family, no friends. I am utterly alone in this world. Bought a car two years ago was my first car and was planning on living in it but got scammed out of 3k. been trying to save again for another car to live in but been unable to. 

Renting a bedroom from an elderly woman with bad health and she is going in for surgery today if she doesn't make it I will be homeless again nowhere to live and unable to survive being homeless this time. My body has arthritis in my lower back, rheumatoid arthritis in my knees and feet. there's days that I just can't get out of bed because of it hurting so badly. there is no way I can survive being on the streets again.

I feel like complete and utter crap especially compared to everyone else and now realizing how worthless I am in life and maybe it is for the best I just don't live anymore. I have nothing in this world to live for other than myself and even then I don't care to do that anymore. nothing in my life will get better. 

I applied for HUD housing and was supposed to move into my own apartment after 7 years of waiting on the list for over 40 hud housing I got accepted to one but I couldn't make it there as I had no money to get there or for first months rent, downpayment, or to have the lights turned on. 

I spent the past ten years trying to better my life but only to get knocked down every time I get up. For example. saved 3 to 4 years up to 3k and bought my first car then got scammed by the dealership. Resaved money up to 900 dollars then needed two teeth pulled which cost 450 each after tax which drained my 900 I had saved last month after almost a year of saving. Then I got called up for my first apartment ever and couldn't get there. 

Two years ago needed eye surgery to remove a cataract in my right eye and now need it done in my left eye but the Dr refuses and now Texas is doing this Real ID stuff where you need a star on your driver license and in order to do that I need an eye exam and I will most likely fail it and lose my driver license because of the cataract in my left eye so there goes the driver license and there goes getting a car to live in. 

Spent years trying to get my GED only to fail it every time I try. spent the past eight years in the dating scene only to get rejected by women over my weight and told I am worthless and have nothing to offer a relationship or just downright mocked at and laughed at over my weight.

I got the cataracts in my eyes from taking Androgel testosterone medication because I have very low testosterone and I am on thyroid meds because my thyroid is basically dead and when they gave the max dose I lost 45 lbs in 8 months with absolutely no changes to my diet or daily routine but then gained it back a year later..

I just literally can't take anymore of this crummy life and to the point of thinking death is a lot better than this and it is better to be dead than keep failing or being knocked down every time I try to do something with my life. 

I also suffer from CPTSD = Complex post traumatic Stress Disorder. I didn't serve just from things I been through in my life and childhood. I also suffer from Severe chronic depression, Severe social anxiety, severe abandonment issues, paranoia and learning issues. I have been diagnosed with them all. 

I have looked up issues with autism and self diagnosing that I may be borderline autistic as I have some of the same issues in that spectrum.

What the fuck am I still doing here?,"So... I've wanted to kill myself for the longest. I've even made several failed attempts. I've prayed to God for death. For Him to take me in my sleep. And every morning after that, when I wake up, I cried because I still exist. I have grown to ultimately hate myself. I feel like the most trash ass human being...

When I try to express this to other people, it will either be met with the ""tough love"" reprimand, or I end up pushing that person away because of my negative energy.

I don't even know myself anymore. I don't have any more passion for things I once did (cooking, massage therapy). I attempt to develop motivation, but my depression and anxiety will team up with the PTSD I incurred from being robbed. When I notice negative self-talk, I'll try to change my thought patterns, but it always ends up back at ""The world would be better off if you were gone."" But I'm too much of a coward to try and take myself out again...

I just want to be happy, man. I want to be who I was before I figured out I was raised in CPS, who I was before being orphaned, who I was before being the state's property and another statistic.

Actually sat down to write the note....,"I've had SI since I was like 8 years old, and I'm 34 now. I've thought many times about what I would put in the note, who I would address it to. Would I write multiple messages, or only one? 

Tonight I actually opened up wordpad and started composing it. I'm just so tired. I'm so tired of feeling like every day is a fight just to exist. I'm so tired of fighting self-destructive impulses and not winning, I'm so tired of feeling guilty because I'm using up the Earth's resources. 

I *know* my husband would be a happier person if I'd just grabbed some balls and taken care of this years ago. He could find someone who actually contributes to his happiness instead of having to support me through my never-ending nonsense. I stood in the way of his chance to establish a new relationship a few years ago. I should have just packed my things and gotten out of his way, but I was selfish. I'm so fucking selfish. If I really loved him I would have let him go to find happiness, instead of expressing my own emotions and selfishness and guilting him into staying with me.

I'm aware that I'm not adequately considering his agency in this evaluation, but I'm also aware of his background. Religious guilt, familial obligation, he's the one who wanted to get married, etc will all contribute to his feeling of responsibility. 

I've almost posted here so many times, but I've always talked myself out of it in the past. I'm not calling a hotline and taking up resources from someone who might actually benefit from them.

I'm also too chickenshit to actually do anything about it. I'm terrified to wind up locked up again (have done a stint in a psych ward at 18 and being strip searched is not something I'd ever wish on ANYONE). I just know I'd fuck it up somehow and not actually complete killing myself, and then I'd be stuck even more miserable.

I don't really know where to begin but suicide is something I have been thinking about constantly. I don't want to wake up, I don't want to be anywhere or with anyone, and I don't even want to sleep anymore and that's the only thing that would numb my depression (because I wasn't awake to feel it). I feel so incredibly lost and I can't help but to want so badly to end it all. I keep wishing something would push me over the edge enough to give me the strength to finally kill myself. Everything's just so dark and honestly I could go on forever but my brother-in-law just walked in and I have to pretend like I'm okay again so I guess I'll stop there. 

I'd just really like to hear the thoughts others have, if this resonates with them, and maybe some suggestions on how to finally let go and give myself that peace in ending everything.",suicideandmusic,8,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/fe9i30/im_lost/,recently joined reddit therefore never done lost honestly need share thought group place feel like really know begin suicide something thinking constantly want wake want anywhere anyone even want sleep anymore thing would numb depression awake feel feel incredibly lost help want badly end keep wishing something would push edge enough give strength finally kill everything dark honestly could go forever brother law walked pretend like okay guess stop really like hear thought others resonates maybe suggestion finally let go give peace ending everything,lost,suicide music

I suffocate 24/7 and wake up constantly throughout the night - Empty Nose Syndrome!?," 

I had an open cosmetic rhinoplasty 4 months ago and since then I've been experiencing symptoms that have been fairly debilitating for me. A few weeks post-op I noticed that my air flow was different in each nostril and there was a slight pain in my left but I chalked it up to swelling.  

Now, 4 months later there is no more pain but I feel like there is a blockage in my left nostril and I can't sense airflow at all in either nostril which is keeping me up at night.  

I'm on sleeping pills which is barely helping me get a few hours throughout the night. I'm really scared and did not expect to go through this scary journey - all I wanted was a refinement. How would I know if I have empty nose syndrome or if I should wait longer to see if my issues are resolved naturally? 

Please help anyone who has gone through something similar or knows someone who has gotten better as I've become a shell of myself.. going from perfect breathing to feeling like I'm walking around with a bag over my head all day is devastating and the real kicker is I'm not even happy with the cosmetic result but at this point I just want to breathe again,,,",amymarie1996,7,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/feb96w/i_suffocate_247_and_wake_up_constantly_throughout/,open cosmetic rhinoplasty 4 month ago since experiencing symptom fairly debilitating week post op noticed air flow wa different nostril wa slight pain left chalked swelling 4 month later pain feel like blockage left nostril sense airflow either nostril keeping night sleeping pill barely helping get hour throughout night really scared expect go scary journey wanted wa refinement would know empty nose syndrome wait longer see issue resolved naturally please help anyone ha gone something similar know someone ha gotten better become shell going perfect breathing feeling like walking around bag head day devastating real kicker even happy cosmetic result point want breathe,suffocate 24 7 wake constantly throughout night empty nose syndrome,amy marie 1996

Feeling empty,"It's not that I hate working but... no, it is precisely that I hate working. I just can't come to terms with the thought that I'm going to waste a huge part of my life doing things I don't like to do. 
For what? I don't see the point on working hard and achieving all these career goals if the only time I'm going to have to myself would be after I retire — IF I'm ever going to retire and not just drop dead in my 50/60s. 
I'm 27 and I have no idea how to live this life, my supposedly only chance at sentience. I'm depressed due to a lot of things: physical health problems, not being able to find a job that I'm going to at least tolerate, feeling generally lost in life.
I hated all the jobs I've been at, ALL OF THEM. It majorly contributed to my suicidal tendencies and I quit my last job with this awful premonition that if I'm not going to quit asap, I'm going to kill myself. 
My family doesn't understand because 'Everybody's gotta work for a living' (the usual), they kind of resent me now for being like this. I'd gladly drink all the Kool-Aid of this world and be a relatively happy working drone at this point in my life, but my mind just isnt wired that way.
I'm tired of constantly feeling depressed, guilty, angry at this world and myself. I feel absolutely alone, even thought I know that I'm not alone in this type of thinking.

Is a title even needed anymore,"For the context, I'm 20 years old, soon to be highschool graduate. So here is what's going up in my mind right now. 

No matter what i write up here it's surely happened before. What is there in being your own individual if your entire life is just a copy paste of someone else's? My decisions won't matter in the long run, because my life is to insignificant. And year by year I feel my presence getting weaker and weaker
 Sooner or later in gonna start working in some industry i don't want to work in and I will feel happy. But I don't want to be happy from something like this. I want to accomplish something but don't have the drive to do it. I want to be special but I'd rather watch YouTube than learn or train something.
My school will be ending in 2 months and I feel weirdly nostalgic thinking about it. Maybe I'm proud of my achievements, which I don't even remember, or maybe I'm happy I'm in a situation I have brought myself into. Maybe I feel like my movie is ending and i need to plan our Mr finishing move. 
Like I said, I will be finishing highschool and I feel like it's an appropriate ending for me. Get a certificate, be happy from getting it, and ends it all. It will be fulfilling.

I Don't Know Why I've Been Thinking About Suicide So Much Lately..,"I know I'm not gonna kill myself, but that doesn't distract me from the fact that I want to. Over these past few weeks, my suicidal thoughts from last year had resurged.. I feel like an absolute failure; an absolute burden to those around me. Every day, whenever I hear someone laugh, I instantly feel as if they're making fun of me. I feel like nobody really likes me... as if all my relationships are fake with others. When people make fun of me, I just let it happen. I either laugh along or smile like a fucking idiot because I don't want to cause any more problems for the person. I feel as if each time I say something, I ruin someone's day. Just today, I said something I shouldn't have... and now I feel like absolute shit even though I apologized after realizing how shitty it was for me to ask that. I don't think he accepted my apology anyways. My grades aren't bad by any means, I have B's and A's in hard classes, but I feel like I'm just crunching under the pressure. My parents hate my grades and all my friends around me seem to just be doing much better than me. I really just think I'm a failure and will never do good in life. I feel like people hate me and view me as a burden. Each time I try something, I never turn out to be good at it. I feel as if I'm bad, or simply average, at whatever I do. I'm not creative, musical or smart. Do I really deserve existing if I can't make a single difference in this world?

&amp;#x200B;

As a result of all of that, when I got home today, I looked for ways I could kill myself and even planned how I'd do it. I don't want to, yet I still went that far.

I don't want to feel like this,"I went out casually with someone who died from suicide weeks after he found out I was seeing other people before I even called things off with him. Back then i didnt think it would be wrong because I thought i made it really clear that while I liked him, we weren't exclusive.

Sometimes the self blame and guilt get so immense and overwhelming and I want to go, too. Sometimes I'm terrified that if it was really my fault, it would come bite me in the ass one day. That thought intensifies the urges to tap out, because I think it would take the blame with me.

It also scares me whenever I remember that analogy about glasses being full, and what if this is how my glass spills over? How do I empty my glass?

"Well, here we are","21. University student. Stressed to the max with zero support system whatsoever. I was homeless before college (and in college) and moved across the country right after high school, cutting off contact with my abusive family. Been suicidal most of the time since being in college and in high school but still here. Came out and got a girlfriend, still nothing got better. We were homeless together for a while and experienced a lot together, been with each other for over two years. She’s an alcoholic though and because it’s a progressive disease things got worse over time and began to hit a low October/November 2019. Anyone who’s got experience with an alcoholic loved one knows how awful it gets. I never thought things could get so much worse, but then I never thought I’d be a suicidally depressed 21 year old and I also never thought I’d date an alcoholic. It has a way of destroying your soul unlike anything else you’ll ever experience, and I’ve been abused since I was an infant. I put aside my own sense of self, my own needs and well being to focus on hers while my heart got ripped out, stomped on, and spat on repeatedly. I’ve been thinking about offing myself for a very long time. I don’t see an end to the suffering I’ve experienced in my lifetime. My girlfriend started her journey with sobriety two weeks ago (at least I believe, don’t know what to really think these days) and it feels like while she’s making leaps and bounds with things I begged her to do for months I’m stuck behind and can’t get my mind out of the gutter from when things were really, really bad. I know things take time but I’m tired of waiting for when life gets “good”. I used to think happiness was a personal choice and I still believe that a little bit, but with all the garbage I’ve experienced in my 21 years I’m mostly just of the opinion that some of us are dealt horrible hands in life and doomed from the start. While I “have” people in my life who care about me I will never have the kind of person who cares about and supports others to the extent that I do. And maybe that’s a good thing, because doing so has made me lose everything about myself. But now my glass is empty and there’s nothing to pour into it. I’m tired of struggling every day.

I'm so ugly I want to fucking end it!,"I'm 24  and still have terrible acne. I used to not hate the way i looked up until high school, but then I got hit with the acne. Huge cystic acne that left scars all over my face and is super painful. I used to look at myself in high school the mirror and say "" I hate myself and want to die"" as a mantra. I was holding onto the hope that it was just a teenage phase, and that I would get on with my life after. Now its been years and years and I still get new zits and cysts every day. It's painful, and they pop and bleed everywhere. I've tried all of the acne treatments except accutaine which my doctor recommended against for reasons in my medical history. To offset the acne I grew my hair long and made it my main feature to distract from the disgusting acne. It became such a large part of my personality that all my friends at the time called me goldilocks. 

Then recently ago I started balding really quickly. My hairline is going way back, and I'm starting to lose hair on my crown. Looking at old pictures of my dad it's all gonna be gone in a few years. I can't stand to look at myself in the mirror. My face is red and pocked and covered in acne and the one and only thing that I liked about my appearance is slowly falling away. I'm some sort of freakish middle age man/ greasy teen hybrid. I used to have moderate luck is the relationship department back when I had my hair, but noone will even look at me now. My hair was the only thing I was ever complimented on. Now I'm treated like some monster that noone wants in their pictures or their life. 

I've been trying to not off myself for a while now. My family would be devastated and that's the only thing that is keeping me from doing it. My brother is getting his firearms licence and wanted me to come with him, but I had to refuse, because I know if I had a weapon it would just be a matter of time.

My entire life has hit the reset button and I’ve entirely given up hope,"This is quite the long story but i just needed to vent. 

TW: drug use

September 9th Of 2018 was the worst day of my life, on that day my father had passed away unexpectedly from a blood clot in his lung that the doctors knew about but never put him on medication for. That day, my entire life had changed and since then I haven’t been able to recover. While yes I was depressed much before this and had been struggling with suicidal thoughts and tendencies since I was 8, my father death had made it all so much worse. I had started to get on anti-depressants, get counseling, and come out to my mother as trans not long after this because she had discovered I was trans. None of these treatments helped much until late November after I had attempted suicide and realized how cared for I was by family that had visited me in the hospital, then I really started to work hard for them to get better and to make sure I could get to the day when I could start hormone replacement therapy in about a year. Not long after that incident I traveled to New Mexico to visit family and my mom fell in love with a hole here and felt the need to reconnect with the family that lived there so she had decided to buy a home here and make my family move, which I can’t fully blame her for wanting to get out of the state we lived in (ny), it reminded her too much of my dad. When I first heard this news I was depressed about it but slowly become more accepting as I got much happier and healthier. I got to a point where I no longer felt the need for medication and cut back on therapy before moving to New Mexico, but those months of hard work all crashed when I got here. When I moved I had honestly lost everything I had known and have been stuck with a family of alcoholics who always start stupid drama over small things. I feel as if I can’t even do anything without someone starting shit about something I’ve done when I’m around them. But anyways soon enough I start school, I’m fairly excited about it but quickly that excitement dies out and is replaced with absolute misery. The school I currently go to refuses to let me use the mens bathroom and makes me use the women’s one because of my biological sex, keeps all of my accounts and name on the attendance as my birth name despite the fact I don’t identify with it, and dress coded me for piercings and dyed hair which they had never mentioned would be a problem when I went to register for the school not even a week before the school year started. So on my first day I get dress coded for things I was never warned about and told I had signed a paper that states I fully read through the dress code and agreed to comply with it (which I had actually gotten two weeks later during school hours). Bullshit, right? Well it gets worse. The only kid willing to talk to me was a drug addict who had done cocaine in front of me and offered me some, while high he almost choked himself to death and chucked a desk at the girls in front of us which was quite fucking terrifying. Almost a month after this event the same kid breaks my pencil sharpener and takes the blade part out of it, leaving the class shortly after to go to the bathroom. Of course I tell the teacher and she gets the counselor to get him, and he gets sent to a mental hospital for a week or so and transfers schools. So while yes, he may have been an absolute crackhead he was still the only friend I had so I was very bummed out and felt alone. Months pass and I feel more and more depressed as days go by, I start contemplating suicide once again and try to get my mom to get me a therapist (which she still hasn’t done). And of course on top of all of this kids at school find out I’m transgender and I’ve been getting dead named, picked on, and asked extremely personal questions  since then. Because of this discovery made by my classmates I’ve started to also gotten rape threats and death threats in which I feel there’s no point in reporting since the school cannot even comply by the laws and let me use the bathroom I feel comfortable in. Well I have started to make friends I still feel all alone and hopeless for things to get any better for my life, I’ve been trying so hard to get my life back into shape and actually gave loving here my best shot but I’ve failed myself and been failed by so many others, I see no point in continuing on since things keep getting worse and I’m not sure if I can hold on that much longer. The only reason I’m still here is because I know there’s people that care and I don’t want to put them through the same pain I went through when I lost my dad.",Throwaway12034056078,0,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/fe9qvi/my_entire_life_has_hit_the_reset_button_and_ive/,quite long story needed vent tw drug use september 9th 2018 wa worst day life day father passed away unexpectedly blood clot lung doctor knew never put medication day entire life changed since able recover yes wa depressed much struggling suicidal thought tendency since wa 8 father death made much worse started get anti depressant get counseling come mother trans long discovered wa trans none treatment helped much late november attempted suicide realized cared wa family visited hospital really started work hard get better make sure could get day could start hormone replacement therapy year long incident traveled new mexico visit family mom fell love hole felt need reconnect family lived decided buy home make family move fully blame wanting get state lived ny reminded much dad first heard news wa depressed slowly become accepting got much happier healthier got point longer felt need medication cut back therapy moving new mexico month hard work crashed got moved honestly lost everything known stuck family alcoholic always start stupid drama small thing feel even anything without someone starting shit something done around anyways soon enough start school fairly excited quickly excitement dy replaced absolute misery school currently go refuse let use men bathroom make use woman one biological sex keep account name attendance birth name despite fact identify dress coded piercings dyed hair never mentioned would problem went register school even week school year started first day get dress coded thing wa never warned told signed paper state fully read dress code agreed comply actually gotten two week later school hour bullshit right well get worse kid willing talk wa drug addict done cocaine front offered high almost choked death chucked desk girl front u wa quite fucking terrifying almost month event kid break pencil sharpener take blade part leaving class shortly go bathroom course tell teacher get counselor get get sent mental hospital week transfer school yes may absolute crackhead wa still friend wa bummed felt alone month pas feel depressed day go start contemplating suicide try get mom get therapist still done course top kid school find transgender getting dead named picked asked extremely personal question since discovery made classmate started also gotten rape threat death threat feel point reporting since school cannot even comply law let use bathroom feel comfortable well started make friend still feel alone hopeless thing get better life trying hard get life back shape actually gave loving best shot failed failed many others see point continuing since thing keep getting worse sure hold much longer reason still know people care want put pain went lost dad,entire life ha hit reset button entirely given hope,throwaway 12034056078
Where do I go?,"I've tried every path possible to stop my pain. Counseling so far seemed like it failed. I'm trying extremely hard at everything but the universe likes to play a reverse card and send me back to the put I just came from. I'm just constantly losing and whenever I do win it's only for a millisecond.

I'm literally extremely humble and nice but in a way I can't be used and the universe still trashes me for it. I'm trying just so hard.

People say it's going to get better but how it's been going only downhill and I'm doing nothing to cause this.

I always feel fake, empty, and soulless but all I want I to feel feel and be full of emotions, but the world I've seen is built to destroy me and continue to get me farther from that.

How many of us are here because of sexual abuse?,"So many people have experienced it, and so many more *don't even realize* that they have. We were too young to remember, or we think that one thing that happened doesn't count, or we are in denial that that's what it truly was. But our body remembers. Our bodies and our souls, they carry the heaviness of the pain that we can never seem to put down. I believe that most of the times people want to end their lives, even if they are doing it slowly through addictions or passive behaviors, it's for this reason. 

Whether we were manipulated, tricked, forced, brutalized, lied to, used and discarded... all of these actions cut deep, to the very core of our being, and it feels like there's no way to ever move past them.

i find comfort in the object i wanna harm myself with.,"today was really rough for me, as i've struggled with my gender identity for almost 2 years now. my boyfriend says that he'll love me no matter what, even if i decide i'm happier as a girl instead of a boy like i've convinced myself. we're both trans and afab, but i'm having my doubts. he told me today that he'd never leave me, but that only made my depression spiral back down. i've talked to him, and he told me all these coping mechanisms, but they never work.
my one ""coping mechanism"" is having the knowledge of the thing i want to hurt myself with is within my reach. i have a utility knife that i wanna use for my own safety in college, but for now i really wanna cut myself with it.

My mom told me to kill myself,"She was yelling at me about school stuff in the car. I usually stay calm and let her get it out of her system but today I snapped and told her that I’m suicidal, hoping that she’d calm down. She did not. She belittled me for it while I tried to keep myself from crying too much. I tried again, telling her that I want to kill myself and asking if that’s what she wants. Her immediate response was “You know what? Do what you fucking want.” 

I’m so tired. I’m sixteen, this isn’t normal. I defend her at every turn, even now in group chats with friends calling her abusive while I’m sleeping over at a friend’s house because the thought of returning home makes me feel like I’m gonna puke. 
I had a vivid image of my dead body covered in blood with a note saying that line of hers and a smiley face. I also want to see the look on her face when I walk up to her with a knife in my hand and tear my wrists open. I want to damage her as much as she’s damaged me. 

I’m not as depressed as I normally am, surprisingly. Just tired. She came by with a bag of extra clothes for me and I think she found an empty pack of cigarettes in my closet because she took a shirt of mine that was under it (I hide it between layers). My friend went out to get it for me because thinking about talking to her face to face made me anxious. She blamed him, to his face, for me wanting to switch schools; that he scared me out of my current program. 

I’m not actually going to kill myself or anything, as much as I want to. It’s too short notice for me to make any final preparations. But I think if I hadn’t called my friend I’d have broken my self harm clean streak and cut down to the dermis again or maybe even deeper. 

The icing on the cake for all this is that I got called selfish by my mom for not coming home. Her boyfriend’s mother passed away recently (we live with him) and her funeral is tomorrow. I have selfish timing apparently, and I’m not even the one who started this whole thing in the first place. I’ve cried so much that I don’t feel any strong emotions anymore. All I have right now is sadness, but it almost fades into me being tired. 

I also have guilt. Not because of this but because I have an important group project due tomorrow and I was supposed to make a poster. I obviously wasn’t able to complete it. People’s grades are going to suffer because I’m too weak to just walk inside the appartment and sit through some yelling     

I just don’t deserve to live, I guess. I’m a massive letdown to everyone in one way or another. People would be much happier with me gone, my parents are divorced and though my dad would be upset about losing me at least he won’t have to put up with my melodrama anymore. My mom won’t have to stress herself out over me being too tired to put effort into school, there wouldn’t be any strain on her relationship with her boyfriend anymore because of me. My classmates won’t have to worry about bad grades because of a flakey group member. My boyfriend can get someone who won’t ruin his mood all the time just by talking about their feelings. My family doesn’t have to worry about me being a disgrace or anything, if a member dies by suicide they’ll likely just get pity rather than dirty looks after I inevitably become a junkie. 

The only one I would really feel bad for is my dog. I don’t see him often, every few months or so. But he loves me about as much as I love him. I don’t know how I could ever explain to him, in a way that he’ll understand, why I’m leaving and not coming back. Why it’s not his fault, the extent of how much I love him, how good of a boy he is. That’s just something I’ll never be able to do for him. 

Vent over. I need to get some sleep but I don’t think I’ll be able to get up in the morning.

It was a very triggering song for me and I sniped my skin after a year long clean streak ( if you’re confused because I’ve been gone for four months I didn’t cut in that time) and gained a handy dandy addiction. I used anything I could get my hands on, then one day my dog was biting me really hard and I went on the floor crying thinking about how everyone hates me even my dog. Then I really wanted to die every day. I have the same schedule every day, wake up and snooze till I make my lunch, I never eat breakfast, switch t-shirts, bike to school and say hi to the crossing guard, go to each class feeling like garbage and cutting in pe and English, biking home feeling like a failure, eating and being apathetic, doing my homework till I pass out (so like two pages in) waking up and doing more homework then going to bed at 2 then waking up and doing it all again.

I don't want to exist,"The summer of 2019 I started developing severe OCD after suffering from mild, unnoticeable OCD for many years. I just feel so tired of things, so bored of living, but I can't commit suicide.

I know that there are people who care about about me, like my parents, and the shit they would have to go trough if I commited suicide is unbearable for me to imagine.

But I just wished I didn't exist, that I never was born. I wish I could vanish from this world, be gone like the wind.

I often wish I would die in an accident or disease, because maybe that would be less painful for the people around me then if I would commit suicide.

I have stayed home from school for about 2 months because of illness related to the stress, not stress from school, but from my mental health. I feel crippled.

One day I woke up and was completely emotionally numb. I couldn't feel happiness, sadness, anger or any other emotion, but it got better. But I really wished it wouldn't have gotten better, it was ""amazing"", I couldn't either feel anxiety so all I felt was blank.

I would tie a rope to a life jacket and confine myself to a tree so I don't drift along the current to a spot where someone would find me. Death would occur within a couple of hours of being in the water, and unconsciousness would happen before then. This method is easy to pull off because it doesn't involve highly intense pain, and I can get out if I really want to.

The problem is that this isn't going to work soon, due to the warmer seasons approaching. I have to quickly decide if I want to die. I'm afraid that if I don't act now, I'll regret it and have to endure life for another year, but I'm also not 100% set on death just yet.",libertysailor,0,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/fe6461/running_out_of_time/,method suicide selected hypothermia river near house 40 degree water fahrenheit 4 degree celsius night one would see would tie rope life jacket confine tree drift along current spot someone would find death would occur within couple hour water unconsciousness would happen method easy pull involve highly intense pain get really want problem going work soon due warmer season approaching quickly decide want die afraid act regret endure life another year also 100 set death yet,running time,liberty sailor
I think not killing your self because it would make other people uncomfortable is complete bullshit,"I want to die simple as that. I don’t want to do this anymore.

When I told people that they called me selfish. “People love you” “think about your kids” “if you do it I’ll never visit your grave”. Why would it take for me to die for people to start showing love for me? Honestly my kid will be better off without me. They don’t deserve to have such a fucked up mom. And I’m not being buried.

My life is worthless.,"Every day now for years, it's been exactly the same. Wake up, attend online school, get scolded by my teachers and parents for my poor grades and how slow I am, spend hours doing homework I struggle with, be overwhelmed and stressed about my life, cry and contemplate dying, go to bed, and repeat. On the weekends I'll either just sit in my room all day watching YouTube or nap all day because I can't even find the energy to get out of bed and  do anything. I can't even find the will to finish my homework. I don't enjoy anything anymore. I don't have any skills, talents, or interests, and I can't even get a job since I live in the middle of nowhere and I'm terrified of learning to drive. I don't even really know anything about the real world. I'm just a husk of a  person who rots in isolation in my room all day fantasizing about being dead.  I am so desperately alone and I feel like a absolute worthless moron. My entire life I've literally never even had one friend. Every time in the past when I was going to public school and tried to make friends with people I always fucked up and made myself look idiotic  because I never understood how to talk to people and form connections  with them. I can't even make online friends. No one cares about me, not even my own parents. 

I  just am so tired of trying to survive each day of hell by myself. I  don't see how life can get any better when I'm already incapable of  achieving anything. It doesn't help either that I'm so scared about the  future. I don't know what I want out of my life, and even if I did, I'd have no idea how to get there with how far I've fallen behind everyone else and how unmotivated I am. I'm scared of fucking my life up even more than I already have. Maybe it'd be easier at this point for me to just drown myself to prevent having a depressing future where I'm suffering even more.

Death without pain.,I've been depressed and I seem to be getting increasingly depressed each day. I want to die so this can stop but I don't want to die because I know that it hurts and would cause my family pain (specifically my sister because I was the one who was able to talk her out mid-attempt and my father because when he was around my age he lost a close cousin to suicide). I want to know if there's any other ways of solving this because I'm aware of how final suicide is but I know if I try talking to someone about this in real life I will just say things to be considered fine so I don't have to cost my parents money for therapy.

[TW] I am 16 and have attempted suicide 4 times; bullying about my appearance is making me consider it again,"I generally steer clear of making posts of this nature since I don't like discussing my personal life on social media. That said, this is something that I feel I must be open about in order to come to terms with it. To contextualise, I'm a 16 year old girl and I'm originally from Eastern Europe, but I now live in the UK. This may be a very long read and I'll be sure to TL;DR.

I was diagnosed with autism at the age of 4. I'm not 'low functioning' (for lack of a better term; feel free to suggest one) per se, but to other people, it's pretty obvious that I am developmentally disabled. I have poor fine motor skills, struggle to articulate my thoughts and am extremely susceptible to meltdowns when not on birth control (I'll explain this later).

For most of my early childhood this was largely not a huge issue in my life. I received good support and people were usually empathetic towards my struggles. However, things started to go slowly and then eventually very dramatically downhill once I got my period age 10.

My parents noticed that I had menstrual cycles that were on average around 21 days in length. Initially, they weren't too worried and assumed they would eventually become more regular as time went on. They didn't. They became shorter, and when I last calculated them, my cycles lasted 18 days on average. This messed up my hormones and I became extremely depressed. This depression peaked around my period. I don't mean that I got typical premenstrual symptoms; in the days leading up to my period, I would self harm, have suicidal thoughts, experience very violent and dramatic mood swings, become extremely sensitive to sound and texture and lose interest in my hobbies and friends. I suggested possibly having PMDD but this idea was dismissed by my parents and doctors.

I first attempted suicide when I was either 13 or 14 (but definitely no older). I didn't inform my parents of this, but only because I didn't want to upset them or make them feel like they had failed me as parents, because they definitely didn't. I then attempted once more aged 15.

During this time period I was prescribed the combined oral contraceptive pill. Theoretically, I am supposed to 'tricycle' them, or in other words, take three months' worth of packs and then take a break. I did this until the second most recent attempt in October of last year. This was the first one that I told anybody about and you may not be shocked to hear that it happened whilst I was on a 'period break'. I went to A&amp;E the next day, where I waited for seven hours before being seen by a therapist for twenty minutes who told me that I seemed to have things 'under control' and took no action except refer me to another therapist, who I had one appointment with where I heard the same thing. It was my mother's birthday that day and I have not forgiven myself for making her spend it in A&amp;E. She stayed mostly collected throughout it all but I could tell she felt very upset and shaken. Since this, I have stopped taking breaks and now do not have periods at all. This is massively helpful but my situation is still not great.

It's partly for that reason that I didn't inform her of my most recent attempt in December. It was also because I was due to fly to Canada the day after the attempt and couldn't bring myself to jeopardise the trip. I considered calling a suicide hotline once I was in Montreal but ended up not doing it, mainly because when I looked up numbers to call, I couldn't find one in Quebec that offered English counselling, but also because my mother discouraged it because of what we would be charged (please remember, she didn't know that I had attempted suicide).

I'm in Year 11, which in the UK is the final year of high school. I'm currently caught up in revising for my GCSEs, which I'm doing OK with from an academic perspective, but struggling to cope with mentally. I'm also being bullied; less than in previous years but still in a way that fucks me up even though I pretend it doesn't. I used to be targeted for my personality and mannerisms, which I've given up being upset about since I've accepted that I don't carry myself typically. Recently, though, they've shifted to targeting my appearance.

This may make me sound shallow, but as a 16 year old girl, having my appearance mocked and scorned is completely crushing. A few months ago it was never something I gave much thought and I never felt insecure about my appearance outside of typical concerns teenage girls have. People call me 'ugly' and laugh at me to my face. I've never been in a relationship of any kind and, at the risk of sounding like an incel, this does not give me hope for the future and makes me question if I am physically attractive to anybody. It makes me feel arrogant for having ever thought that there was nothing wrong with the way I look. And I'm starting to spiral emotionally because of it. 15 year old me would have laughed at the idea of me being so insecure about my physical appearance, but for me, it was one of the few things I had genuine confidence and pride in and now it is being taken from me.

I feel very shallow and fragile for feeling this way. I'm 16 and have four attempts to my name and it's embarrassing. I hate that I'll never really be able to disassociate myself from that because this isn't what I want to look back on in 10 or 20 years time.

Possibility of reincarnation putting me off but making me feel even more trapped...?,"I think about suicide most days. When I visit my 92yr old grandmother in her care home I wish I could be there, waiting to die - how peaceful it must be to know you will be released from all this suffering very soon? 

I consider myself a spiritual person and have been heavily into yoga, meditation and psychedelics and learnt about Buddhist philosophy which is what has formed my beliefs about death. Most people find this a healing path but for me the transcendental experiences I have had have felt like such a homecoming that I haven’t wanted to return to reality. I have never felt at home in myself and often feel like I desperately want to “get out of my body” in which I feel trapped. I have always felt I was born into the wrong body/life. I’ve also believed from a young age that I will die from suicide or a reckless accident. I unsuccessfully attempted age 25 and have had some other near misses. 

The thing I am struggling with is I believe that if I kill myself my soul will return back to the source but I am worried it will be turned around and put right back into another life of equal amount of suffering to mine as my soul won’t have evolved at all. I don’t think I can escape it unless I evolve by overcoming my struggles. I’ve had an eating disorder for 17yrs, as well as BPD and Bipolar. I guess this is the cycle of Samsara and the continual dukkha/suffering which is part of the human condition. 

When I think about this it makes me feel trapped and is going some way to put me off the idea of suicide, but at the same time I feel like I’ve exhausted my energy to try and overcome it all in this life - I’m exhausted in my battle against this ED, it feels completely hopeless.  Perhaps if reincarnation does happen at least I could try overcoming some other set of struggles?

How?,"I just want to be happy. I haven’t been happy for the last four years. The last time I felt that sensation in my brain was my freshman year of college. I was talking to a girl and I could feel the dopamine in my head. That was the last time I felt happy. I’ve been chasing that feeling ever since. The friends have helped make me feel whole. When I’m alone I don’t know what do. I repressed these feelings for a long time. I started watching Bojack Horseman and the feelings came back. Am I a whole person? Am I took messed up too feel love again? I ask myself this every day. When I’m drunk I am able to let these feelings out. I don’t want to be dependent on alcohol to feel this way. I want to talk about my feelings, but I don’t want to be less of a man. Jessica has made me decently happy, but I still don’t feel this way. I don’t want to be dependant on her either. When I beat off I only can finish when I think about personal emotions. I can't even cry anymore. What does that mean? Am I better? I don’t have decency on alcohol. I have stopped for a while and I still feel this way. I don’t know if it is because I’m lonely or because of how messed up I am. When your mother tells you that you should have been a miscarriage you reevaluate life. At the age of thirteen. Is that really an age when you should be questioning your existence? I don’t want pity, I just want to feel normal. When I look at myself I question my life. I have accepted death, but I have also noticed the finite life you have. Once you live, you die. That is scary to me. I just want to cry, but even while writing this I can’t. There are people worse than me, but the way I think about it is, have wasted my life? College is full of life. I haven’t lived one. I wish I was dumb and could fade into the crowd, but I can’t. All I think about is my deathbed and how it won’t be anything. I die and that is it. I’m gone. In high school, I had the same thoughts, but my stepmom said that I’m young and I don’t understand. I find myself having the same thoughts. Maybe nonexistence is fine. I just want to lay in bed and drift away with my mind until I do die. I’m afraid of the loss of thought. Once you're gone your gone. Nothingness. I’m scared. I just want that feeling one more time, but how does happiness happen? Relationship, family, or accomplishment? The future scares me and I don’t want to sit here on shitty earth and have these feelings at fifty. How do people become happy? I’ve lost the feeling and don’t know how to get it back. Once we die that is it. Am I going to die and feel nothing? Is a relationship enough? Or am I broken? I almost want to pass away not think. What does it all mean? Are we just bacteria that evolved enough to think?

My little sister is suic*dal,"Ever since my little sister was in the 3rd grade, she's been extremely unhappy and alone. She had strange rituals where she would obsess over locking the doors (pointing to the OCD she has today) and was the unspoken black sheep of the family. My older sister and I already were aware of her depression, and took her to a counselor (who didn't do much for her). We saw her cutting herself, but were too afraid to approach my parents as they are African. It wasn't until last year, my little sister of eight years old walked into the bedroom and saw my sister h\*nging herself on the back of the door. Luckily we got her in time, and she was admitted in the hospital. After a week or so, she came back beaming and happy. She has a therapist who she ""adores"", and is on medication. Everything was going smooth until she relapsed into her ways, and I caught her in another attempt. She's attempted. around 20 times now. My mom has had to quit her job to watch her. My sister claims she is doing fine, but just the other day I checked her phone and she was searching suicide methods. I have many after-school activities and no one can watch her around the clock. Someone please help me, I'm beyond the point of stressed and I have no determination. My grades have decreased this year because I spend so much time looking after her, yet, she ignores me and complains how people bother her. I'm scared to go to sleep, because sometimes she roams around looking for ways to hurt herself again. How am I supposed to help a teen who doesn't want to help themselves?! I'm in my junior year of high school, (my most important year) and I am completely hopeless. I love my sister so much, I can't even imagine not having her.

"Please don't ignore this, I am going through some stuff right now.","I can't fucking stand looking at myself in the mirror, my face is round and my cheeks are too chubby. It's a fucking baby face and I see kids younger than me who are able to have defined jawlines, clear skin etc. But no, not me I have moderate acne and I have psoriasis which is starting to flare up. I try to look after myself, but it gets fucking hard getting out of bed and actually looking after myself when I wish that all of this would go away. 

They say I look like my Dad, as if it were a positive aspect, even though he left me when I was a baby. So what? I'm supposed to be grateful for looking like someone who not only was a deadbeat, but also that I should be grateful that I have to look bad for something I couldn't control. I just want to get plastic surgery ASAP. The only reason why I'm working so hard (or at least trying) is to get enough money to fix this shit. I feel so anxious that I feel like when people talk to me, it's out of pity. Why would you talk to someone who looks ugly? My personality doesn't match my body; I can be aspirational, confident at times (shocking right?) , and empathetic. But then I'm a 6'2, slightly chubby piece of shit and whilst that could potentially be fixed, why the fuck is it so hard for me. I swim about 1.5 - 2 miles a week and I eat okay and I can't lose weight. And if I were to get plastic surgery etc., I know that my family would disapprove it, despite that my siblings look so much better than me, seriously. It's not even my family, but my mum, how would she look at me.

But on the other hand this can't happen any longer. It's like my reputation is based on looks when I'm so much more. I want to cry but no one would care because *where's the reward when it isn't a cute ""depressed"" girl to help?* I get judged for being nice, as if I were trying to get some. Could any of you give me your thoughts on plastic surgery. It pisses me off how I would get criticised, like I'm forced to stay this way but others who are naturally fit get to have a good life. I just can't keep going on.

I remember one time I was talking to someone and felt like I wanted to cry because I was thinking ""no one would ever see me like the way they see other people "" (i.e. romantically). I wanted to die, like I always have. But I cannot for certain personal reasons. Hence I am trying to choose the other method: work really hard and if things don't change I **will kill myself regardless of my morals &amp; the consequences etc.** But please, don't comment the bullshit of ""you'll find someone who loves you for your personality"". That is pity and that fucking beats me to the ground. I had a mini panic attack but I tried to contain it to write this. Opinions would be appreciated.

I don’t know.,"Dear Reddit, 

Hello everyone here :) 
I’m a 16 year old female. I’m not feeling too well right now. I’m getting these thoughts and suicidal feeling again. They come back occasionally. Right now, I’m eating with my beautiful mother, laughing with my dad as he says my mother is a wonderful cook. I broke down last night when I finished reviewing and studying from my classes. I studied hard for a test I had today, and I felt good about it! Right now, I’m eating as I type this. This day? I thought it would be bad, but it was okay, turning to bad. I’m In a relationship. I love this boy so much. I’ve been happiest with him since years ago. Im a sophomore in high school by the way. I’ve trusted my boyfriend so much and he’s always been there for me. Today however, I felt something was wrong. He didn’t really speak with me. But it’s okay, I’m probably just overthinking it, I want nothing but pure happiness for him. Whether he finds it with someone else or me. I’ve always helped others, always had a smile on my face and I’ve always wanted nothing but happiness for everyone. I’ve only want happiness for everyone else. I want them to feel good and appreciated by atleast someone when they do something. I’ve always supported through anything and I’ve never judged. I’ve been kind to everyone. I appreciate everything that’s given to me, but it’s been a few months I’ve been feeling these usual suicide thoughts. They come often. It’s been a year since I’ve been like this, trying to hang on and move on from it. Whether I see happy moments, times where I love this view. Or others where I’m not sure how I’m feeling.

I felt pressured by my mother. Verbally. I hate trying so hard at school, and failing. What’s the point? I’m going to fail anyways. I’ve always done my best in everything and I’ve always tried to stay happy and look the positive way. But I can’t anymore. I’ve always thought, what if I can just end it? Would anyone really miss me? I think about it, imagining my parents. But, would I really make a difference? Will I go to hell? Religiously talking, I love god. But I’m sorry, I feel like I’ve lost faith in myself. I don’t see it anymore. And every night, I pray, to have a good day, to see my parents, my friends. To stay safe. I want to die, but I don’t. But I want to attempt, but I’m afraid. What if I fail? Would my family be ashamed? 

I think about it daily, and I feel like the only reason I’m
here is for my love. To be there for him when he needs company, to be there for him when he can’t find the light, to be with him when he can’t be happy. To support him through the good and bad. No matter what, no matter the past. For my dad, who’s worked really hard every single night for me and my family. For my friend, who needs support from his friends and family. For my dog, who always listened to me when I felt alone, knowing he wouldn’t understand, but knows I’m upset and let’s me cry on him when I don’t have anyone else.  

I don’t know, I feel like tonight could be it. But I don’t want too I just wonder, would it even matter?",zer0life233,5,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/fe2stx/i_dont_know/,dear reddit hello everyone 16 year old female feeling well right getting thought suicidal feeling come back occasionally right eating beautiful mother laughing dad say mother wonderful cook broke last night finished reviewing studying class studied hard test today felt good right eating type day thought would bad wa okay turning bad relationship love boy much happiest since year ago im sophomore high school way trusted boyfriend much always today however felt something wa wrong really speak okay probably overthinking want nothing pure happiness whether find someone else always helped others always smile face always wanted nothing happiness everyone want happiness everyone else want feel good appreciated atleast someone something always supported anything never judged kind everyone appreciate everything given month feeling usual suicide thought come often year since like trying hang move whether see happy moment time love view others sure feeling felt pressured mother verbally hate trying hard school failing point going fail anyways always done best everything always tried stay happy look positive way anymore always thought end would anyone really miss think imagining parent would really make difference go hell religiously talking love god sorry feel like lost faith see anymore every night pray good day see parent friend stay safe want die want attempt afraid fail would family ashamed think daily feel like reason love need company find light happy support good bad matter matter past dad worked really hard every single night family friend need support friend family dog always listened felt alone knowing understand know upset let cry anyone else know feel like tonight could want wonder would even matter,know,z er 0 life 233
I can’t forgive myself,"I don’t know how to keep going. I drove away the person I loved the most in the world. I never loved someone like this. But I lied and told him I was completely over my ex. I wasn’t. He said he would leave me if I did. So I lied. And later he found texts. I broke up with my ex for him. But he found us talking about our relationship. I still love you, I told her. He was heartbroken. You cheated on me, he said. I insisted no, it was breaking trust, but you can’t say cheating. I apologized so much. I changed so many behaviors. I couldn’t make it up to him. He finally came to me, didn’t talk to me two months, and said, you cheated on me, you manipulated me. I’m done. He did many things that hurt me during the whole time we knew each other. He left me and came back so many times. It got worse and worse. But it’s not an exchange. No matter his actions, I should have done better. I lost him. He was right. It took me so many months to understand what he really meant. I thought of this every day. Now I get it. I destroyed him. I loved him so much. But this was so disrespectful. I’ll never see him again. I’ll never get to love him again. I did such a bad thing. He’ll never care for me. I need to die. I know everyone will convince me no. But I do. I can’t move on. I can’t forgive myself. This is the person I love with all of my heart. I would do anything for him. I ruined my one chance with him. I ruined it! We can’t be together. I miss him so much. There’s no end to how this hurts. Finally I understand that I deserve it. I don’t want to stop myself anymore. I can’t talk to my friends. They’re so sick of it. I talked to them millions of times. I talk about this every day. I can’t move on. There’s nothing anyone can say. I’m as bad as he said. I’m everything he said I was. I’m an abuser. I never understood it before. I abused him! How could I have done that? How could I not have seen it? How could I not have begged for forgiveness? I hurt him so bad. He wanted to kill himself, it hurt him so bad. I deserve it! To feel like this! I can’t forgive myself. I can’t solve this. I can’t get what I want out of this. He’s so far moved on. It’s over, it’s done, I can’t get over it. I want him back so badly. I miss him so much.

Killing myself tonight,"I've been intensely suicidal since I was about 7. There are so many things that make me this way, and I'm seriously going to snap soon. I can't take it anymore; my dad screaming and threatening to whoop my ass all the time, and my mom smothering me to the point that I don't think she'll ever see me as something other than her sweet little baby. I was almost self harm free for a month, but of course I fucked that up and cut again. I hate myself so fucking much, and I hate myself more for even trying to get help and support from anyone. People have told me to my face to kill myself, yet I don't blame them at all. I'm just a fucking selfish asshole even though I don't even think of myself as human. Every single minor inconvenience makes me want to slit my wrists, which of course, only makes me feel absolutely fucking terrible because there are so many people that have it worse off than me. My dad threatened to beat the shit out of me again, though he didn't do it, and I think that's what's really pushing me over the edge. He's a tall, very muscular guy at 6'4, so it isn't like I could defend myself anyways. I want to kill myself so bad, just to end the world's suffering. I'm such a fucking burden, and it's like everything that comes out of my mouth is just more reason to rid them of my existence. My mom is insanely over protective, always insisting on ""tucking me in"" and kissing me and laying with me. And while that is a lot nicer than being literally beat by your mother, she FORCES me to kiss her. Once, I refused, and she pinned me by my wrists to my bed. I put on such a thick facade that sometimes I don't even know who I am. Nothing I do is actually myself, I'm just pretending for everyone else's sake. People are actually stupid enough to care about me to an extent. Sometimes, I wish it weren't like that, and that they wouldn't be affected by my death. The person that they think they know and love doesn't exist, and nobody knew me before I was how I am. It's not like that matters now; I was just a kid. I'm such a fucking idiot. I hate myself. I'm sorry that this isn't too long, and I'm sorry that it's jumbled around, I've been crying for about three hours and I'm at my wits' end. I love my girlfriend more than I've ever loved anything, and I'd hate to leave her alone when I'm dead, so this post was just to maybe help me get everything out of my head and be a fucking sensible person. There's so much more to say, but right now I really can't think of anything.

I was by no means not suicidal before the relationship or during the relationship but now I’m out of it, I feel cold, alone and suicidal a lot more. Something about being held and comforted by someone who I actually loved was peaceful. I’m a very heavy guy (16 stone heavy) so I’ve always found Bad luck in relationships. Due to this and the countless bullying I suffered due to my weight, I’ve been very depressed and suicidal, and when a person comes into my life, I just get attached to them easily. I just feel like I’m worthless, like I don’t deserve the happiness I want to have.

I think its time,"I'm posting here because its anonymous and frankly I just wanted to speak my piece before I end it. I feel awful inside, everyday trying to mask the pain with busy work, or arrogance and charm towsrds others to distract myself. I've felt empty for quite some time. I finally opened up to my wife about these thoughts a year ago and she blamed me for how that made her feel knowing I want to kill myself. She left me some short time after. Since then I've had about 6 months of time to really digest my thoughts and feeling. I feel an incredible depression each day and then feel even worse when I think about my children having to deal with my death. For a long time that deterred me from suicide, now it seems more like a valid solution to my pain and a way for everyone to move on. I dont want anyone to find my body which clearly describes suicide. On the contrary I'd like to frame my death so the narrative suggests a noble death and therefore easier on my family. Of course my children love me, but it's been an incredibly long time since I've felt love or purpose. I feel like a paycheck, a slave to everyone else's needs, a pawn in someone else's game. I'm happy that I experienced love, excitement, danger, success but I feel now at the age of 35 the good days of ignorant bliss are behind me.

I am suicidal but I can't kill myself because of laziness.,"I really don't know if this is the appropriate sub-reddit for this but I find it really funny when I become suicidal. 

The intent to kill myself is very strong and it reaches the point that it creates a heavy feeling in my brain and renders my progress with my mental health null.

I realized that depression isn't a one-time thing that can be cured with constant means of pharmacology.

I am now in this state of wanting to kill myself (again) but is too lazy to get a knife downstairs.

Tell me why not and I'm being serious,"I'm a 53 year old man and my life has sucked on so many levels. I've been married and divorced 3 times and several LTRs over the years, including the one I'm in now (over a year and we live together). I've got 5 kids, one just turned 13 last week. She wants nothing to do with me, nor does 2 of her half-sisters, who aren't even nearby (I called DFCS after we split because there were (literally hundreds) of roaches in the apartment in which we lived and she would so nothing about, among other things (like the time her autistic son found her loaded, insecure handgun), but those details are just stuff since I'm now a pariah. 100% would call again. So anyway, no contact with the youngest 3.

But what I'm really struggling with is, ""Why not?""

I know all of the typical reasons involving everyone else, that they'll be hurt, it will affect them horribly, etc. But what about me? Why not? My girlfriend really doesn't like me tbh. (she said I'm the rudest person she's ever met and I believe she means it, even though I've never been told that I was a rude person in 50 years.

But for me, aside from how it affects others, why the hell not? I have no religious faith, because I just don't. If you take away how it affects others, I just don't see a reason to keep living anymore. My job sucks, my girlfriend doesn't even really like me apparently, and I see my parents once a year for 2 days or so and my only brother I haven't seen in 7 tmyears even though we get along.

My hearing sucks, I'm constantly having to ask people to repeat themselves and that frustrates all involved. And even when I don't, I have really loud tinnitus. Neuropathy, ADHD, constant joint pain (not debilitating but always there), frequent memory loss (my gf had to show me pictures of our 3rd date at a steak place because I didn't remember it all and that's not uncommon).

So, why? My current relationship is probably ending soon anyway. For me, what's the point? I don't want to hear about how it affects others because that just adds more guilt to what's already been a pretty shitty life and kinda makes me want to stop that guilt too because I wouldn't have to feel it. I know it's selfish and suicide is indeed probably the most selfish thing I can do. I get that.

Anyone else just don’t enjoy life or I’m the only one? Like I don’t find anything interesting or I just don’t care about anything?,"I’m about to turn 20 soon, and lately I realized I don’t even enjoy living.

Everyday I wake up, I don’t even want to get out of bed I just want to lay there. When I do get out of bed I just hate doing anything. It doesn’t matter what I’ll be doing I just rather be dead all the time so I don’t have to do anything? Maybe I’m lazy or something but I just hate doing stuff? I rather just be dead lol, so I can just be in peace.. 

I’m on antidepressants and they help but I still don’t enjoy life, there’s more why I don’t enjoy life mostly cause I can’t hold a job, or keep any friends or even talk to anyone. I just feel like a fucking ghost.

Been thinking about just ending up, but can’t get enough courage to do it.

Life got better for a short while after that but it didn't take long for me to lose everything what seemed worth to me back then.

My Story (depressed steroid user),"Hey. After much meditation, I decided to create this post, both as therapy for myself and to open up a forum of conversation. I am writing this right before I go to work, so I will probably edit it later. So here it goes. I apologize in advance for my rambling. 

I am currently 20 years old and a sophomore  in college. A few minutes ago I typed in “I’m eventually going to kill myself” into google trying to find some forum post to read. Lo and behold an r/suicidewatch post came up from 3 years ago, which led to me creating my reddit account to make this post.

Throughout my life so far, I have struggled from a crippling loneliness. I was mostly a loner in middle school and high school, one of those arrogant assholes who only care about grades, etc. Inside, however, I had a crippling insecurity about my body image. I have a distinct memory from when I was perhaps 10-11 of staring into the mirror and looking at my face, critiquing every last bit. To those I know, this would not make much sense as I have always been told that I am very attractive. I have never seen it, however. My phone, to this day, is filled with photos that I have taken of myself. 

Deep down, I think that my depression is mostly of a natural physiological basis. Up until I was 18 I had never even held a girl’s hand and up to now I have only kissed one (a very pretty Italian girl who left the country soon after). I have spent most of the last 2 years listening to sad songs, driving aimlessly, chain smoking, and watching movies like Her and Manchester by the Sea. Luckily enough, I do have a best friend that I met in HS who struggles with depression as well. He however, has no problem picking up girls do to his charisma that he has developed over the years as a coping mechanism. Together, we mostly drink, smoke weed, and watch “films.” I always make it a point to get drunk or high enough that my entire life, past and future, flashes before me in a sort of slideshow. 

As I write this, I have been using steroids on and off for 2.5 years. I first started after losing 25 pounds (mostly by starving myself) and then developing an ok physique. I thought that nothing else would make me attractive so I made the decision to buy Testosterone Enanthate off the darknet when I was 17. I didn’t give a shit if I died because, in my mind, there was no other way to find a girl to fill the void inside of me. Now, I am very muscular (5’10’’, 190, around 10% bf), yet my void is not filled and I don’t think it ever will be. 
I am on a solid trajectory right now and will inherit a large sum from my grandfather when I turn 25. This adds no meaning to my life, however. I see myself as a sort of Holden Caulfield or Amory Blaine (from this side of paradise). All I want to do is help people and be loved, but I have a crippling fear that I will only feel loved vicariously, by watching movies and reading books. I can’t shake the feeling that I won’t make it past 40 before I eventually kill myself. My father is currently slowly dying of alcoholism from his depression at 50 just as his father did.

Every time I think of this I am taken back to a memory from when I was a senior in HS. I had been talking to a girl for a month or two and my best friend had hid the fact that he was having sex with her. I had never felt so inadequate in my life. I drove home crying and tied my belt around the doorknob and leaned forward. Thankfully I didn’t follow through with it. This inadequacy still consumes me. I just want hope that someday these feelings will subside.",sacha--102,1,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/fe385v/my_story_depressed_steroid_user/,hey much meditation decided create post therapy open forum conversation writing right go work probably edit later go apologize advance rambling currently 20 year old sophomore college minute ago typed eventually going kill google trying find forum post read lo behold r suicidewatch post came 3 year ago led creating reddit account make post throughout life far struggled crippling loneliness wa mostly loner middle school high school one arrogant asshole care grade etc inside however crippling insecurity body image distinct memory wa perhaps 10 11 staring mirror looking face critiquing every last bit know would make much sense always told attractive never seen however phone day filled photo taken deep think depression mostly natural physiological basis wa 18 never even held girl hand kissed one pretty italian girl left country soon spent last 2 year listening sad song driving aimlessly chain smoking watching movie like manchester sea luckily enough best friend met h struggle depression well however ha problem picking girl charisma ha developed year coping mechanism together mostly drink smoke weed watch film always make point get drunk high enough entire life past future flash sort slideshow write using steroid 2 5 year first started losing 25 pound mostly starving developing ok physique thought nothing else would make attractive made decision buy testosterone enanthate darknet wa 17 give shit died mind wa way find girl fill void inside muscular 5 10 190 around 10 bf yet void filled think ever solid trajectory right inherit large sum grandfather turn 25 add meaning life however see sort holden caulfield amory blaine side paradise want help people loved crippling fear feel loved vicariously watching movie reading book shake feeling make past 40 eventually kill father currently slowly dying alcoholism depression 50 father every time think taken back memory wa senior h talking girl month two best friend hid fact wa sex never felt inadequate life drove home cry tied belt around doorknob leaned forward thankfully follow inadequacy still consumes want hope someday feeling subside,story depressed steroid user,sacha 102

I have no real friends who care, and I can't be bothered to do anything right now, I just want to sleep without waking up to see another morning.

"Maybe the world is going down, maybe thats a good thing.","I’m so over it. I’m so over everything. I’ve been getting worse in my isolation, but it yields better results for the world and myself for me to be alone.

Maybe i’ll go insane, but what does it matter. 

My boyfriend does not love me, none of them ever have.

My best friend does not like me that much.

I have so much wrong with me physically and mentally, if society wasnt so accomodating to idiots like myself i’d be dead. I should be dead.

My boss thinks i’m racist because i’m terrible at communicating something. 

Once i loose that job, i’ll have to deal with my dad, who is bad enough as it is to deal with when i do have a job.

Loud noises make me panic, i dont trust anyone, i like to deprive myself of sleep.. if i was anywhere else i’d be dying slowly. Or maybe someone would of come along and put me out of my misery. 

But i dont feel complete without the misery, i dont like to inflict it on others unlike people i know, i just dont feel like myself unless i’m depressed and suffering. I feel greedy if i’m not unhappy.

I listen to everyone, but no one listens to me. When they do, i over do it because i guess i’m just selfish and thats all they see of me. So when i ever open up again, they roll their eyes and leave.

I don't know how to get better,"No one’s really gonna read this, but yeah.  
I’m 15 years old and got diagnosed with depression when I was 12. I strongly dislike talking about my ‘negative’ feelings, partially because of trauma, partially because I’m afraid people will look at me differently. When I finally did open up about it, it didn’t really go well and got immediately dragged to a doctor to see ‘what’s wrong with me’. I’m afraid to open up again.  
Once I got into therapy, literally before the second appointment I send the therapist an email saying I feel much better now and don’t need therapy, because I thought it wouldn’t work.  
I know bottling up my emotions isn’t healthy, but it’s all I’ve been doing my entire life. I do sometimes talk about it online, but that’s all, and even then, I just feel awkward and like a burden to the people that have to listen to me.   
I got held back last year because ‘I didn’t feel like going’ (which is what I told everyone) when I couldn’t get out of bed and tried really hard to not kill myself. I had my second suicide attempt that year. I didn’t want to tell anyone, like my teachers, friends or trusted ones because people know me as happy, bubbly, dumb and annoying, or something like that anyway. I feel like a fucking failure.  
I thought my mindset would change over time, but it never did. This year, I’m doing a tiny bit better, I’m less absent, but I’m still not doing great at school. It’s not really that it’s hard, I just don’t have any motivation at all. I always thought I wouldn’t make it past 15, or would just end up killing myself anyways so what’s the point?  
But I want to stay alive for some of my family and friends. So, suicide isn’t an option anymore. What will I do know? I want to live, but I have no motivation at all. It’s like everything’s just a big joke. I know I should care, but I don’t.

Advice to hold on two more weeks??,"Don't mind the grammar. I'm Dutch.

**Don't read if you are easily triggered. I don't want any of you feel bad/worse.**

Okay, some of you already start typing reasons to stay alive. Y'all are so kind for doing that. I miss kind people. Everyone leaves me 'cuz I'm depressed. And everytime I'm in my deepest point of a 'depression wave', somebody dies. Like life also tries to convince me I should kill myself.

So I heard in August I could go to a mental hospital in MARCH. So at that point it sounded so far away that I gave up and neglected myself. Cuz everyday was hell. And I was supposed to wait 6 months. **But** of course I was thankfull my psychiatrist got me on the list of the mental hospital that is specialised in autism. So I was too scared to really tell I wouldn't survive until then.

I've been severe depressed in october. Didn't really come out of my room except for diner or to go to the toilet. Selfharmed the whole day long, slept when I was tired, not on a certain time so my sleep rythm was ruined. Gained weight. Couldn't concentrate on anything. Like I was in my mind already fading away. I became sure life was giving my signs that I should die. Everything that could go wrong, DID go wrong. And in my deepest point, my grandma died. I still haven't accept it. Her death didn't feel real for days. It was on the funeral where it felt like life punched me in the head. The amount of emotions were so much that I tried to not be in the reality anymore. Thinking about an alternate life. Writing stories and imagining me in it constantly.

I think that last thing gave me a depersonalisation disorder or something. I don't know how it works and I know I can't diagnose myself. But on moments where I have a lot of emotions or when I'm a little stressed, I feel like I'm watching my body experiencing things. Like I'm the coördinator in my head watching through my eyes. I can't really talk or think cuz I feel like my body should talk or think in that situation. I'm just watching what happens and take decisions.

And then late October... I was standing on the edge of the bridge and decided to talk to an old friend, instead of jumping at that moment. (She has DID, and one of her personalities is an agressive one who made me dissociate when she wanted me to kms). You can say she's a bad influence, but she's the only one still standing by me and the only one with the same kind of humor. She has help so the thing that happened last year won't happen again.

Anyway, I became a little happier, started enjoying going outside again. I made friends in a therian community cuz I figured back in August I was a therian too. (whatever your opinion is about 'therians', pls dont post them here cuz this isnt what the post is about)

Idk why, but I knew I was going into a depressed moment again, as I was irritated everyday and selfharming again.... So I landed in the depressed wave again. Or should I say drowning? I don't enjoy anything, every food tastes boring. I can't sleep cuz I cry every damn night. I'm constantly thinking about kms. I'm even trying it, or sort of searching boundaries. Taking pills but just enough to still stay alive. Or standing on the edge of the bridge but not jump.

What triggered my to write this post, was because I heard a cat of mine has cancer and he may not survive another week. The cat that shoved his fur in my face :') so I got a little distracted in a traumatising situation which happened 2/3 years ago. (Can't talk about it now cuz PTSD flashbacks will kill me with this amount of emotions I have now) The cat that walks over my legs, jumps in my neck and demands attention when I'm crying on the floor in the middle of the night. He is like my ESA (not official one) And I'm about to lose him. I can't go through this. I can't lose the last string of the rope that I'm holding on the edge of a ravine. I feel like kms at the moment. I don't wanna die. I wanna be of this pain.

About the mental hospital in march? 18 days until an apointment to talk about practical stuff. then I have to wait another week (I guess?) to finally be there and be save from myself.

But plz give me some strenght, some advice. I know I need to hold on these last weeks, but I can't. Every minute of everyday is torture.

Transgender Wasted Life,"I am in my early 30s, transgender MtF and my life is in ruins.  I have no friends and I don't mean that figuratively, I mean it in a literal sense. Nobody cares about me. I used to have a decent life until some bad decisions and mistakes. I've never taken drugs or been addicted to anything (not that it matters) just trusted some of the wrong people including my parents.   


About four years ago, I moved back home to be with my sick mother. In doing so, I fucked myself over. She died about a year later and I became stuck in the middle of nowhere with no transportation and now surviving off of the 'generosity' of some very religious family.  I am living alone in a small mobile home on my family's property. I am unable to have guests. I am unable to find work because I don't have transportation and other reasons. I have severe depression and social anxiety. I have mild OCD. I haven't been able to be on hormones for the past 4 years. I am not myself.   


Please forgive the rambling nature of this post. I'm just typing as it comes to my head. I have no future. I have no viable possibility of getting out of this and starting my life over.  I live in a mobile home infested with bed bugs. I've slept on the floor for four years without even changing my sheets or blankets. I haven't had laundry detergent in four years. I wash my underwear in the bathtub. The heater has been messed up all winter so I've been freezing. I have one blanket and one sheet. No pillows after they got infested with bed bugs.   


All I've eaten for the past three years are potatoes, macaroni and cheese and balogne sandwiches. I haven't been able to even leave the house in 3 years and the last time was for my moms funeral. I can't even shave my face or legs because I haven't had razers, shaving cream or anything in three years. I haven't had face wash. I've had the same bottle of shampoo for three years. I've had four bars of soap for the past three years... My kitchen sink doesn't work, I wash my one plastic bowl in the bathroom sink.  I don't speak to anyone. I'm essentially already dead. Although I doubt I get 2000 calories a day, the type of foods I've eat have made me gain at least 30 pounds and so none of my clothes fit me. I have one pair of stretchy pajama pants and two tshirts that fit me.  It could be worse, i could be homeless so I've kept this inside for this long but I'm tired. My life is really already over. I'm exhausted. After this month, I won't have internet and I am fairly certain with nothing to do at all, no music etc, I will go insane. So I've made peace with my fate and I guess this is the last month of my life. I don't remember what happiness is. I can't even think of anything that could change my life at this point. There isn't even a dream. There just isn't a point to go on at this point.    


I feel like a failure. I feel sad and hurt. I found one of my mom's journals recently, she mentions she was raped by her father when she was a kid. So that is the energy surrounding me. I'm stuck here, isolated and treated like an animal basically. If I were to die, nobody would care or probably even notice. So thats it. I can't think of anything else to say. But I needed to get it off my chest.

"I'm going nowhere fast, and I'm all alone","I'm 19 and first attempted at age 7. I've basically wanted to die for most of my life. I've attempted several times since then. Most recently I was about to in august but realized just before starting that the mode i selected was physically impossible for me.

I am not in college and am unemployed and looking for a job. I've been looking for months, but I live in an isolated area and don't know how to drive so my options are nonexistant. 

When I was in school, I was active in theater and would ask my closest friends to come to my performances, and they had no desire to support me, even though they knew how much it meant to me, even though I offered to arrange a ride for them and pay for their tickets. I was always the one who had to make plans, and my best friends would frequently cancel plans on the day of. One of my best friends was still in her pajamas when I came to pick her up once, and she told me she didn't feel like going out after all and shut the door in my face. This same friend called me an hour after my 18th birthday party started already to tell me that she would rather not go. 

I haven't seen most of my friends since graduation, and most of those I have, when I run into them in public, they ignore me or pretend not to recognize me. I have a bunch of internet friends I'm close to and have known a while, but they like when I send them funny memes but they don't care about me as a person, and I don't blame them. My family doesn't really care either. They did when I was growing up because I'm the youngest, but now that I'm an adult no one gives a shit. 

My parents had a big messy divorce and the bank took the house as a result, and I had to give up my whole life and everything I've ever known to move halfway across the state with my mom. The whole experience was very traumatic and I'm plagued by horrific nightmares every night. I've been on 3 different antidepressants in the last 6 years, and not one has worked. I have a lot of health problems too, which have only worsened despite my best efforts.

I have no direction for myself. I don't want to go to college. I'm in constant pain. All I can think about is wanting to die. I beg god all the time to let me die, because i can't take it anymore, but I'm still here. What I wanted more than anything was to be in the entertainment business, but I've been refused even ensemble parts in every audition.

Feels like a weight's sinking me down.,"No matter how much I struggle, I always end up feeling awful and get off track from pursuing my goals.

Thinking feels tiring for me, so I tend to spend most of my life in a dissociative fugue state, if that makes sense? I feel anxiety when I force myself to think analytically. 

I also feel like I can't ask for help from anyone around me. I'm mostly a stoic person who's infamous for showing no outward emotion, so people mostly get amused when I'm upset, which enrages me.

Slitting wrist doesn't work; this is a rant. advice on what's good about living?,"I tried it last week, it didn't work AT ALL. Media is a scam. I think for it to work it's gotta be super deep and you gotta bleed for a long while before anything starts to happen.

... My ideal has always been carbon monoxide, but idk how to make that work. Isn't it dangerous (lol) if the house catches on fire if I'm just burning firewood or something in a bucket in a carpeted room? (recommendations?)

But in the process of thinking I was going to die, I did not regret anything at all and even felt peaceful for the first time in a long while. I think it's a good choice for me personally so I need to figure out the CO plan. However, I cut my wrist on a whim and know rationally that I am young and have family and people who I know will be disappointed/devasted if I take my life, so I need to wait until I'm older so that, to put it morbidly, at least my immediate family dies of natural causes first. But it's still very saddening to live, especially knowing death comes so easily (despite my strong survival instincts).

***What do you like about living?***

I'm looking for little things such as ""some beds are very comfortable,"" because ""things will get better"" is the stupidest BS I never want to hear again. Therapy/social workers are also just normal people anyways so don't tell me there's help either. Or share a funny joke. I once called crisis line for a funny joke the lady was like ""wat? wat? do you want to tell me ur problems?""

- Severe depression. No cure and never getting better.
- 30 year old virgin. Still don't know how to make friends or talk to girls.
- Not able to focus myself and get into the field I want...so stuck at crappy jobs.
- About to be fired from crappy job #9 for being late too much. (Late almost every day cause I can't sleep nd can't get myself out of bed in the morning)
- Massive debt due to school loans, car repairs, and me being stupid.
- Bank account at $-111. Could have afforded the make the account positive today if the bank would waive the fees one more day. But they won't so I can't.

Basically I can't manage time, money, sleep, or a social life. So I'm calling it here...game over.

I am one of 10 children slotting in at number 7, I have been emotionally and physically abused by those who were supposed to nourish me. Here’s whats different though so not only did they make my life hell they controlled my life where I was and what I was doing to the extent that I couldn’t even make my own decisions on the little things and still cant. 

Thing’s I have been beaten for just so you get the vibe

·  As a child I would pee in my sleep so I would be woken up by a belt hitting my body

·  As all kids do I would fall asleep on the sofa watching tv, so I would be woken up with a belt hitting my body

·  I once told my dad there was no point in doing something AGAIN because nothing was good enough for him… to which I was beaten with a metal pole until I could no longer use my arms to defend my self and just took blows to the head dripping blood all over the house.

**To summarise I have been fucked up.**

But im trying to figure out how and when this all started at what point did I become the person I am now (Afraid ,insecure ,manipulative and untrustworthy). I give myself these attributes because that’s all I really am. I am afraid of the world horrified possibly I have ran out of classes (IN FUCKING UNI) because I felt as if everyone was looking on me I have this crippling feeling that everyone is always looking at me. Insecure lol I don’t even know what to say I have deleted everything on my social media’s multiple times purely because the anxiety of someone giving a fuck enough to look at them and then the possibility of them finding my pictures funny gives me so much anxiety that I’d prefer them not be there. Am I manipulative yes, but I don’t understand how one can not be manipulative. I like to have things my way of course we all do but I know how to get it done I know how to get responses out of people or to get people to do what I want because I had to learn to. I'm one of fucking 10 children and I showed up in the middle and this wasn’t no brady bunch happy family shit this was controlling, abusive and manipulative and I guess that’s what I became, you are a product of your environment after all. I don’t really know the purpose or direction of this as I have just stopped crying again (its 2:13pm) and decided fuck it imma do this so if I do kms at least maybe one mf’er can know what I been trying to say.

So guys I think im going crazy this is a new development if you don’t mind me starting here, I sit in my room and talk to myself inside my head for hours a day full on conversations (guess this is what happens when you don’t get to train social skills). Sometime’s I cry sometimes I get so angry I don’t even know what to do and sometimes admittedly I feel straight up heart broken as if I have been done a disservice by the world and unfairly I was born into one family instead of another. I fantasize too much and I kind of sorta relate to people from Netflix series. Like Joe the stalker I get it bro you just want to feel a solid love that aint going no where and youll do anything to keep that but in turn you require a few things loyalty being one of them. Fortunately I can say I don’t relate to him with his killing (that would just be another burden in my head to drive me crazier) instead when my heart is broken people just kick the pieces to side and move on. 

Fuuuuuuck im really not good at structuring things I write.

Ok I think the logical thing to do is start with little stories from childhood and work my way to present day. 

I was born in 1998 in Africa and moved to the United Kingdom at a young age not sure how young because I don’t remember. My dad had been previously married and had 5 children from his first wife and at this time only 3 from my mum me and my 2 brothers one a year older one a year younger. It’s said that when I was born they thought I was a fucked up baby, I was going to be disabled or something of the sorts (not in a doctor said it way, but like I was born and they looked at me and said na this aint it way and little would you know my little brother was born just under 10 months later) Fantastic way to start life. So we all lived in one house when we first got to the UK (very vague memory of this shit by the way combination of what I've been told as fact and what I know to be true) So as a kid I have been described as a quiet and timid kid so quiet infact that my older brother and sister (age 12-14) (from a different mother) would pinch me or hit me to make me cry because when I would cry it was funny that I would make no noise.  I was also a huge fan of lion king asking them to watch it multiple times a day with me, everyday. We then moved a couple times memory all blurry and we arrived at the next destination that I remember. We lived in a flat in a small town in England for a couple years, my memories of this place are my   constantly injuring himself severly by playing out, dbz, Toonami, vegeta and ps2. I was a normal kid but I would get fucked up by my dad. (btw im around 4-6 years old) I still remember the time I was called downstairs just to be beaten I think for drawing a rude picture that was discovered after I had just been beaten. Boom boom not too much going on just the entrance to a life of suffering but not too much tbh.  


We then moved to a council house elsewhere just kids and mum because dad had decided its stressful to live with people so he’d rather pay 1k+ rent elsewhere for his own place then help his family. These years weren’t too bad though if anything they were my favourite because he wasn’t around it was just us 3 years in that place from year 2- year 5. He would still drive down though on occasion just to hit us and then return to his home on the flip side of the uk. This was fantastic for my personal growth of course as I learnt that being a father means coming over shouting and arguing with your wife, beating your children and then cutting. And by beating I mean sure we were between ages 7/8-10 but he would hit us with all he had leave belt marks for days all over my body. To the extent the neighbour’s would hear us screaming and would then mock us the next day as we walked to school. He then thought that we were becoming bad children (at the time me and all my siblings were top in our classes thanks to our mum keeping us up to study with her , as well as this at this age we started being forced to go to mosque mon- fri (5-7) and then over the weekends we would go to Arabic school and if we were at home we would play outside in the park so I don’t know how bad we could of really been but who knows.(she was in college so while she did her homework she helped us with ours)). Actually with that being said I would steal from my mum not a lot and not everyday but a pound or 2 here and there just because everyone else in school could afford to buy things like sweets and toys and I would never be able to join in because I had none. I would come home from school and mums not in so id have to sit outside the house for a couple hours people would walk by but I had no friends house to go to like my brothers so I would just sit at the door and wait. My life has been hell maybe its easy from an outside view to say naa aint that bad but try live it everyday you come home aint no body even in, by the time everyone does get in its all at once no time for you and mum to talk no dad asking how was school bruh go to  sleep. To summarize though I was studying everyday 7 days a week and still being beaten along with my brothers but I had a newly born sister and it was time for the move to the big city so fuck it maybe its about to get better.Bruh I forgot and now remembered this nigga would look all 3 of us in the garage for whole days just because and the punishment for leaving would be you get beat and thrown back in there. Think about the mentally how much that would fuck you up you aint even fucking 10 yet.

When we first got to this new city we were quick to discover its rough out there day one we were robbed. They were no more parks we could just go to play at so now I became and indoors kid. To go along with that now my dad didn’t live too far away he was only in the neighbouring town so instead of monthly “visits” it was now weekly. Fair enough to say within a year I had put on I don’t know 10 maybe 15kg I was fat af going into year 7 but in year 6 I was a very thin framed kid. I was depressed and I'm not sure if I knew it but my life consisted of go to school and be bullied to come home and be beaten not knowing where my safe place was I chose solitude I learnt out of sight out of mind (didn’t even work all the time but nigga I tried) My mum became pregnant again… (this was not necessary but I've grown to love the child) so now they are soon to be 5 kids and none of which already receive and adequate amount of love. Just to further paint the character of my father he beat my younger sister who was at the time maybe 3/4 because she took and hid his phone (later revealed he left it in his jacket pocket) NO APOLOGY HAS EVER BEEN GIVEN EVER IN HISTORY FOR A MISTAKEN BEATING. We spent little time in that house but what do ire member being dragged from under a bed to be beaten and being beaten nearly every morning without fail for 1/2  years for bed wetting (punches were not pulled).   


We moved again after same sort of thing really he’d show up for a few days fuck up everyones mood and cut no one wanted him around but no body would say because everyone was afraid of getting beat again. This is the house I lived in when I decided ahh man maybe this life thing isn’t for me went and sat at the window ledge in my room 3rd floor looking down and wished I could just let go. We would be locked in the attic this time the door is genuinely locked we couldn’t get out if we wanted room was what 3x4 meters storage room basically and 3 of us had been locked in there for the whole day. Living in such circumstances created bitch nigga behaviour amongst us as brothers because the beatings were bad you did not want to be beaten it would fuck your whole shit up. So niggas started snitching bruh my own brother came in my room while I was learning to beat my meat took my phone took pictures of what I was watching and then showed everyone while I was sat in the living room… I was then promptly beaten. This the environment I grew up in even in your own fucking room you couldn’t do shit you couldn’t trust nobody and you were very likely going to be fucked up for anything you did. This could include but was not limited to holding your brothers hand while fighting… (that’s gay apparently so you would be beaten). Defending yourself to your parents (Its rude to speak back so I was beaten), Not speaking (its rude to not speak when spoken to so I was beaten). Finishing the milk bruh imagine your 12 year old hungry self wanted some cereal finished it and then gone beaten for it that was my fucking life. Id go to school this fat unloved ugly kid, (I think this is a good time to point out I went to a bad school in a white neighbour hood and as we all know aint nothing scarier than poor white people jk…) but those guys were harsh to me day one of highschool I had a fight why because I was being racially abused, I was constantly racially abused I was not even accepted by my own race because I wasn’t black enough (I am quarter white 3 quated black so skin color dark brown meant I was a paki, I was an Indian I was a terrorist osama bin laden was my uncle so on and so forth) aint no body ever gave a shit about me not a single teacher not no body. And this is where things get fucked up for me this when I started doing dumb shit I started being a prick to my friends not fully understanding what was even going on but just thinking out of I gotta cover my back I gotta make sure I aint no punk but in reality it made me into a punk. But ill get to that later. I still remember everything nice people have ever said to me that I felt was said genuinely though, once the most popular kid in school told me to not let anyone pick on me and just tell them im not Asian although I had tried both I felt his sincerity and very much appreciated it and still think about it to this day. 

I wanna fast forward now to year 11 when shit really hits the fan, I moved to a school which was mixed gender (years 7-10 I was in a boy school) and the introduction of women had definitely caught my eyes (hadn’t seen them in many years since everyday was school mosque home runescape repeat maaaaaaaaaan FUCK THAT SHIT that’s the worst childhood and to make it better slide a couple hundred beatings in over those 3 years and now you might be beginning to get a grasp on who I am as a person. Of course they are little moments when things workout but not really. To summarise I was in love or atleast I felt like I was I did horribly on my exams which at the time I accreted to me just focusing my time on her and not myself and that started the downwards spiral. My little brother told my parents I wasn’t fasting at prom (I have not ever fasted a day since, pretty sure I gave up on religion a long time ago but that’s its own thing) and I was beaten then locked in the house so I could not attend my final meeting for NCS (I had saved up my 5 a week for 10 weeks to pay the 50 to go and now I just couldn’t imagine that feeling I was going to finally be away from this whole home all summer and now I couldn’t why because my dad who had now moved in full time had decided to spite me).  


The summer of finishing high school of enjoyment had arrived my plans to be with my friends had been put to a halt. My plans of going to a top 3 college in the city had been put to a halt. My summer was instead me just sitting in my room everyday the whole summer alone not talking to anyone for multiple days at a time. This is when my solitude became serious I became an awkward nervous rek after this I couldn’t even talk to people properly without overthinking everything id say if summer was 10 days long I was beaten on 6/7 days as well so yh torture house and to make it better I had no friends because we moved so fucking much I didn’t know a single person and couldn’t get to know them because we lived in a jewish neighbour hood and if you’ve ever lived in one as the only black muslim family you aint going to have no friend. But yh returned to college and it was ok except for everyday I would come home and be locked out of my house everyday without fail my dad would sit in the kitchen looking out the window and laugh at me having nowhere else to go so I would sit in the gardens storage cupboard nothing much at all probably just a big wardrobe but It was dry. I would then go to college and repeat this process day by day mentally exhausting my self little by little more once again through in beatings on.4 out of every 10 days and you have the image of what my first year of college was like. My parents decided as a family we should read the quran together (muslim people book not all of it like a page each a day) so I read my page and left and while I was goning upstairs I heard him talking about me so I decided ah im probably going to be beaten let me stay here and wait so I did and soon enough I heard him say “why did he read that page, he read that a few days ago hes looking for the easy ones” so my mum said “ill call him back down and he can read again”, I was called “….. come downstairs and read again” and I replied “Whats the point nothing I do is good enough for him anyway” to which he responded by walking into the kitchen getting a metal pole and coming to hit me with it. The best bit for him it was a detached house so no one could even hear my screams. At first I tried to block with my left arm and then I just couldn’t hold it up anymore so I switched to the right and the same happened so then I was just lying there being beaten by my dad with a metal pole bleeding all over the floor from my head and when he thought he was done he left. This day is the day I lost my shit as soon as I could stand I went and grabbed a knife but was stopped by my mother (I always found it funny how she would always come to stop me but never him). I then called the police when they arrived they was so much blood on the ground floor corridor that she threw shoes over to hide it because it could not be cleaned while he sat there on the sofa smug knowing he had gotten away with it my mum had hidden me from the police and that was that another great day in the life. 

I had become sick of it and told my mum I do not care what she thinks I am tired and I am leaving I will go to foster care if I must but I am not dealing with this shit anymore (I don’t know if its important but I was also 17 without a phone or laptop or any communication with the outside world, if I was in my room all day I was playing badminton against the wall staring at the ceiling or creating fantasies in my mind to rescue me from where I was currently) I told her ill get a job (just received ni number) ill figure it out for myself and what did she do?

She said nothing for maybe a month and then we were moving house so she came in one morning and just told me we are moving pack up so I did thinking we are moving away from that cunt and she had chosen me her son over her manipulative controlling abusive husband… Instead she had rented another place and just dropped me off there would come round maybe every month or 2 for an hour or so and that was my life. Now I was completely secluded and this was the first time I actually tried to kill myself I had a panic attack the anxiety just got to me I took all my sleeping pills at once and boom I woke up the next day… they were all fucking natural herbal things and they couldn’t do shit. Bummer I know. She still doesn’t know about this I continued thinking about killing my self shit I never stopped from that first time till now but It was just thoughts and ideas I had finally tried to and failed. Instead I started smoking weed which would help sometimes but other times like I learnt the hardway it would make me think about my life and whats actually happened and compare it to my peers around me and I would breakdown crying. My life has no direction, I have no family around me (which is ironic in a family of 13(3 parents 10 kids))because we had all been tormented soo much we didn’t know to look out for eachother we had to look out for our selves first. This is why im selfish I cant afford to not be because if im not my own number 1 In terms of in a greedy way like If I don’t look out for ME first no one else will. My mum then told me she didn’t want to continue paying for where I lived and I had to find somewhere else (now that I was 18/19) which is a real bitch because if I had just done what I wanted to years back and left this family of suffering I would have been alright but instead now im going to college everyday thinking about where tf am I going to live. So I dropped out of college to work, I ended up returning to college having to restart living in a city different to the one I studied in working night shifts to then go straight in to class but I figured it out. Got to uni and guess what I don’t know what the fuck is going on. 

Everyone is social and I don’t know how to socialise sometimes I feel as though I stand out so badly that im just not supposed to be there im surrounded by people who life has blessed people who have seen the world people whos parents love them soo much that they even come to watch them train at uni. In my whole fucking life there has never been a single thing I've done which I can say I looked into the crowd and had a single person there to support me. Instead I have been told to dream is free, I've been told your not going to make anything with your life and you are going to be a failure. Honestly I have accepted these as truths now. I don’t even feel like myself anymore I feel stupid as if i took a couple too many hits to the head information doesn’t sink in properly anymore. I'm embarraced in class because everyone else knows what they are doing to some level I have no fucking idea everyone else goes home for Christmas or there family comes to visit. LOOOL my family don’t give a single fuck. I AM ALONE IN THIS WORLD TIRED DEPRESSED AND READY TO GO. I accepted death a little while back, one night I was lying in bed crying and realised I don’t have to deal with this anymore I really don’t I have accepted I will kill myself and I am just waiting for the day in which I get my final little nudge to step of the ledge.

I just want to be at peace.

I also had a girlfriend for a while she cheated on me so I stopped valuing her as a person and just kept her for the other stuff. She even got pregnant and aborted it. I'm 20.

I think I’m going to kill myself tonight,"I don’t really know what to right tbh

I’m a 15 year old trans guy, came out when I was like 11 and waited on the Tavistock (the uk gender clinic) for like 3 years and then once I got there they distarged me cos I don’t have any fucking friends anymore and my step dad was being a prick so that apparently means I don’t know shit about myself, we literally only had like idk 3 meetings. I had been waiting so fucking long for this. I feel so fucking dysphoric all the fucking time I hate my body so fucking much. I just want enough testosterone to at least make my voice a little deeper. And what’s pushed me to the edge is when I went out yesterday literally 5 people called me a girl and my mum and step dad have pretty much given up on calling me a boy and by my pronouns, they always call me a girl/thier daughter and use she/her. And even if I do get to transition this society is so fucking transphobic like just on fucking twitter or some shit and on every post to do with trans folks it’s always so negative like there’s a whole wave of even cis lgbt ppl hating us. Literally what’s the fucking point. I’ve already attempted suicide over this when I was 12 and camhs did absolutely nothing, no therapist or anything.

"I just got fired for comments I didn’t mean to say and ended up upsetting co-workers. It was my first termination in life for that reason. As long as I have that on my conscience, then I think death is better than trying again.","I was called and told over the phone by my employer that “we have to to cut ties” because of some comments, assuming bad jokes out of recall, I wasn’t aware they upset my co-workers. My first reaction led me to punch my fist into a wall in a public area and now my mind is swirling with thoughts of candid anger. This was my first firing and I’m not processing it well. My first thought is why bother apply for other jobs when I have the reason on my conscience? Second, if I do try again, then I better embrace the bias hateful questioning about my termination. Third if I tell anyone, then I will lose everyone close to me. Fourth, if I tell my parents, I will be a shame and burden to have committed such an act.

Life sucks without money.,"It’s just constant fucking stress. I literally would rather die than deal with this for one more day. I can’t even afford my bills. I had to go on a subreddit and beg for money. Luckily someone helped me out. But that is not sustainable. I don’t know what to do anymore. I moved across the country to “start over” and all I did was put myself way behind where I was in life. I had $5000 saved up to move and it’s all gone. The job I lined up before I got here is complete shit. I only get eight hours a week. Eight fucking hours. That’s down from twenty when I first started. And I’ve applied for every fucking job in this town with no calls back. I thought I was doing something wrong until I heard other people from work talking about having the same problem. It’s a college town so every job is a competition with like 20,000 students. 

I don’t know what the fuck to do anymore. I miss being able to go out and do things. Or even just handle my own problems as they come up. My snake had to go to the vet and I had to call and ask my grandparents to loan me money. Its so depressing. I just paid rent and now I have $20.

I want to die,"To be honest, I'm 35 not much good has come of things. I studied hard and undertook an education degree at 25. It ended up making my mental health worse and I quit during my prac placement. I finished with a shitty Arts degree, but ended up with Honors...  It's not that I am unintelligent or incapable... In fact it shows some capability but no one is interested in what I do and I have no contacts so it makes it near impossible to get in to the job market.

I have panic disorder,  I am having panic attacks every day now (sometimes multiple times a day) which makes my life insufferable.  I have to use Xanax to maintain some what of a normal life... otherwise people think I am just lashing out at people (I'm not it's the condition). No one seems to understand anxiety, panic, and agitation. Doctors don't do shit, hospitals do even less. I've gone to hospital asking for help and am just put back out on the street.

I have been given Propranalol for anxiety. I have since told the  hospital I will swallow a whole bottle of Propanalol soon and no one cares if I do... It's the same result that I just get put back on the street even when I do ask for help.

I'm about to be made homeless and I can't support myself due to my chronic anxiety condition (panic disorder). My life sucks and there is no way to fix it.

I've suffered domestic violence and abuse in my family from the beginning until now and now I have finally had enough. I have been told to move out of the house I am living in. I have no reason to try or any interest in trying anymore.

If I will not die by Propanalol I'll simply buy barbiturates and do it once and for all properly. At this point the fear of going to prison for buying barbiturates does not bother me.

Done,"Been suicidal for a few years and today im done.

I haven't had the thoughts for a minute now but today they came back full force and I frankly am just tired of living. Life fucking sucks and Im over it. Tonight i plan on taking my life.

EDIT: final message before I go. Since im going to go anyways, i pulled out my vape (i quit multiple times already) and started going to town. My throat now burns and I feel super weak (head rush from the nicotine) so I plan to relax, and when I can move again, grab my knife and end it all.

I really don't want to live anymore,"I've never talked about this with anyone, but I really don't want to live anymore. Because what is the point? Why am I here? I can't do anything useful in my life until I become an adult, I ruin almost everything, I cut a lot and am always worried someone will see the scars. I get confused when I see people genuinely enjoying themselves and having fun. It blows my mind. How are they so happy? How can anyone love themselves? I don't love myself. I'm fact I hate myself. Because I deserve it. What use am I to anyone? 

The answer is none. I'm not of any use. And you know why? It's because whenever I've tried to be useful I mess it up. So, what's the point? What the point of enduring an existence that I can't seem to enjoy? I haven't been diagnosed with depression, so I'm not going to claim that I have it. But, what other explanation is there? And even if that is the explanation, does it even matter? Does anything really matter?

To whoever read this all the way through, (I know this sounds cliche) thank you for reading my scattered thoughts and emotions. I hope you have a good day tomorrow.

I don't know if I can do it anymore,"So there was this girl that I've known since forever, but years ago I ended up having a major crush on her. After,  me and her started talking more and becoming close friends. We went for a few years of talking for a few months, her pushing away then a few months later texting me out of the blue and repeat. Almost 2 years ago we stared talking again and it was great. Her house every weekend doing stupid shit like watching Youtube videos, music, and Netfix till like 11 at night. We also ended up talking feelings stuff which I never do, like I'm an emotional guy, but I don't show it. But I kinda felt like I was like I was living for the weekends, that and spending time at lunch in school. Like we weren't dating, but we were super close friends and we had talked about how I felt about her, but she wasn't sure how she felt. After hanging out less and less for a few months, we graduated. That night she sent a text about how she felt and that I had pushed to much and we haven't talked since. That was about a year ago. I don't blame her, at the time I was scared of losing her and I just kept pushing. But it hasn't gotten any better I still miss her more than ever. I honestly feel like there is something wrong with me, holding on for so long, and I feel really lost not having her in my life. Part of really wants to try talking to her again, but I'm afraid that will just hurt her more than I already have. I don't want commit suicide, but I really don't want to exist.

My story - from happy to suicidal,"This all come downs to my boyfriend leaving me, in december 2019. Ive had a hard life, with a mother who was a drug addict when i was young, and a father who left when i was two.

I have had all sorts of bad father figures in my life, cause my mom didnt chose the best men. Theyre all dead now. I met my bf in december 2014 (when i was 16), and he left me last december. The 5 years with him, was the best years in my life. He was my bestfriend, and my only friend. I have never been so happy. We had a dog together, which i now had to sell, cause i couldnt afford him alone. I feel like i have lost my whole world, and i now have nothing. Im very suicidal, and has been for 3 months. Ive written my notes to my family, now i just need to find the courage to do it. The memories of my ex haunts me every day. It was the best time of my life. We did everything together. He really was my ride or die. He left because he didnt have feelings for me anymore. Came out of no where. Ive told my therapist about my thoughts, but she doesent seem to take me very serious. I just wish i could stop existing. I dont want to live anymore, and everyday is a struggle. Im devasted about the fact that im gonna put my family through this, but the pain is to hudge.

"Heres my suicide note, Is there anyone who wants to talk?","Goodbye

I wish things could have gone differently, I hate every second of life. I hate every thought that I have, every breathe that I take and every piece of my life. I don’t want to suffer for the rest of my life, but I also don’t want others to suffer for my “selfish” choice. I hated growing up, abused, everyday insults 

for something that I didnt do. I hated going home and then going back to school feeling different and separated from everyone else. I rushed life, I didnt do anything important growing up, I had amazing friends that I love and who also are the reason that I’m still here. I was always told that I didnt know 

anything, and maybe I don’t, maybe this is a foolish choice, maybe theres a hell. I feel like my life is just going into a dead end. I hate college I dont even know what I want to do with my life, I feel like im wasting my time, but at the same time I feel like Im learning more about my self but why the fuck is it 

so hard? I have a chance to go the campus therapist, but for some reason i keep hesitating to call, its like I need someone to push me, but theres not going to be anyone, its just me alone in my dorm room.

But I’m failing at life, really want to die, and am too embarrassed to explain to the people closest to me that I would rather die than proceed with my futile attempts at life. So here I am, on reddit, for some unknown fucking reason. I guess I just need to vent and this seems like the best place because I’m sure no one I know will look here. So here it goes

I’m 23. Live in my parents basement with an amazing girl that I really don’t deserve. Most of my life I’ve been the quiet kid. Most people were scared of me in school because of that, but I’m too much of a pussy to actually do anything. Only reason anyone would talk to me was because I played football and went to school with most of my team. 

From elementary school through middle school I was really fucking ugly. Acne was terrible, huge fucking nose, no confidence. Had like 2 encounters with girls during this time period and I was a hardcore “nice guy.” Those 2 encounters were enough for everyone to realize I’m pretty fucking retarded. So most people avoided me. High school I peaked. (and by peak I really don’t mean much. Just the time that I wasn’t absolutely pathetic) Met the girl I’m with now, got in really good shape and did pretty good in football. Managed to get fucking C’s all throughout though so I got no scholarship for college. 

After high school my parents were amazing enough to pay for my college. 5000 fucking dollars a semester for me to do average my first semester then fail calculus my second semester. After my second semester I let my father convince me that I should go to school closer to home and do electrical engineering. First semester I did average. Next semester I failed fucking Chemistry and lab. Semester after that I failed my chemistry lab again so I had to switch to Computer engineering. Semester after that I failed Pde’s. Pretty much every semester after that I’ve failed classes. Not because I’m not learning the material but because I’m so fucking lazy I don’t do half the homework. Usually my homework grades suck but my test scores are good but not good enough to keep me from failing. Every year my parents keep telling me that they are going to make me move out and pay for my own school, but they keep giving me more chances and I keep royal fucking those chances. Honestly don’t understand why they give me so many chances. 

Anyways, this year isn’t any different. Last semester I took 3 fucking classes (9 credit hours) and failed all three of my classes. Worst I’ve ever done. So this current semester I’m retaking 2 of the 3 I failed and just had to withdraw from one of them and the other I will probably get a C in. I don’t get it. I have a part time job at fucking Chili’s, I live at home, have everything going for me; don’t have to worry about expenses, amazing girlfriend, family that loves me. Yet I can’t fucking pass two fucking classes.

I’m a failure. Honestly no other explanation. I get to tell my mother that after this semester I am dropping out and moving out, therefore waisting 50,000$ of her money. Thing is, if I can’t pass two fucking classes how the fuck an I suppose to live on my own. Other thing is, I wouldn’t be on my own, my girlfriend would be with me which makes everything worse because I would be dragging her down with me. So instead of moving out I have decided I should probably just kill myself. I’ve planned it out for the most part. I have a 30-06 in my room that guarantees my death, I’ve scouted a place out where no one will be able to find my corpse. I haven’t written my goodbye letter because I’m honestly too pathetic to write one and probably won’t even leave one, I plan on depositing all of my money into an account that my girlfriend has access to so she can get out of this house as quickly as possible if need be, etc...

I know my death will negatively impact those closest too me but I’m almost positive my parents will get over it. Honestly my father has given up on me so I don’t think he’ll care much. My grandparents will be devastated but they will get over it.
Only one I’m worried about is my girlfriend. She’s about to start a new job right when I plan on killing myself and I don’t want to ruin that. I’m sure I can figure something out.

At the same time. I really don’t want to die. It still breaks my heart that I have to leave everything behind. My family has two amazing dogs that I would die for, I managed to go out with a girl way out of my league for 5 years that’s about to get a job relevant to her dream career, I have grandparents, aunts, and uncles that all seem to like me, etc...

Guess I’ll just bring a couple bottles to try and get over that heartbreak so I can pull the trigger.

Anyways, sorry to start my own fucking pity party. It was just hurting me to not say or write anything before I die since I’ve done relatively good at hiding my depression from everyone.

Almost,"So I’ve been depressed since about 4. Started cutting around 12, the same time I had my first flashback to the first time I was raped. I made serval attempts since I was 16, never really trying hard enough. But tonight I really really really wanted to do it. I tried cutting myself but the knife I got wasn’t sharp enough... my boyfriend ended up calling me in the middle of everything. So I talked to him about it, I was on hold with the suicide hotline anyways.

I guess I didn’t REALLY want to otherwise it would’ve worked? I’ve always heard of people just cutting, but it ends up going too deep and that’s how they almost die. Don’t know why I’m writing this.. actually I do I want to hear from someone. Encouragement, your story, anything.

guilt,"I've been suicidal in the past and really thought I was better. For some reason started thinking about all the bad/hurtful things I've done to people and within like a week went from feeling generally good to researching ways to kill myself. I feel like a shit person and like there's no good reason for me to live. I just want to stop feeling guilty and I don't know how to do that except kill myself. And I feel like I would kind of deserve it.

I'm scared that even if I make it through this I'm just doomed to being suicidal all my life and eventually I'll be impulsive enough to do it.

Gonna kill myself after prom,"I’ve been suffering from depression and anxiety since like 8th grade. I was molested when I was younger which definitely doesn’t help but honestly I just wanna kill myself cause of my current situation. I just feel so lonely and just downright defeated honestly. I thought I’ve been getting better but realized that I’m actually just regressing in different ways. Instead of being sad about my problems I laugh them off and ignore them leaving them there, instead of being too open with my friends driving them away I now have serious problems not being able to express that I care about people. It’s to the point that apparently (someone else pointed this out) I physically shake when I begin talking about anything wrong with myself. I’m so fucking sick of this you’d think of after 4 YEARS of consistently fighting and trying everything (medicine, mediation, therapy) NOTHING has been accomplished. I always feel like an outsider looking in, never really belonging. Sometimes I think my friends secretly don’t like me and I don’t blame them. How could you like someone who can’t express that they care about you. Never been in an actual relationship, to the point to where when my entire workplace realized I probably wasn’t going to prom so my friend volunteered to go with me which to me feels like a complete pity act as she does have a boyfriend. So I think my current plans are I’ll take this last month to get everything in place, have a great time at prom, and overdose on something (probably alcohol).

Feeling my life is over,"Hey, I created an account because I honestly dont know what I am doing anymore on here. Last year was the worst of my life. My long time GF (4  years) and I broke up. She lives in a different state so I flew there to speak to her and atleast end it on good terms. The day after I started a new job. 

It started well with my manager happy but the next week I had another manager who joined (the person who hired me was sacked). Towards the end of the first month, I ended up having surgery on my back. This is where the issues started, The surgery and the breakup really affected me physically and mentally and I kept making errors which were easily avoidable.  Eventually it got too much for them and they released me.  

It took me 3 years to find the job in my field which I graduated in and i honestly thought it was what I was looking for. Unfortunately, I got left with no job and now no partner. 

I have a job now - in my field but not exactly the same (if that makes sense) but it is really going nowhere. My manager is good and is happy  with my performance but the organisation does not allow for any growth. The person who I replaced is younger than me and is already far ahead in their career than I will. To top it all off, I live in a small town and it will be hard to hide the termination.

Boyfriend's classmate jumped off a 6 story parking garage yesterday,"He wrote a note and everything. Nobody knew a thing, he was so successful, athletic, smart, social. He was friends with everyone. All my boyfriend can say is how depressing the air at school is, how low everyone is, how it just hit everyone. This person took their own life. They're gone.

All I can think about is myself. How many times I've attempted it and failed. How much of an asshole I am for wanting to put that suffering onto others, and yet how much I want my death to impact people. I feel like I'm not suffering bad enough if I don't kill myself. At the same time, I'm convinced suicide is no longer even an option taken how many times I've survived.

This other kid was so strong, so brave and so powerful that he was able to leap 6 stories up to his death. He wrote an elaborate note. He kept his mouth shut about his inner turmoils and nobody knew a thing. On the other end is me, I've done nothing but fail at everything including trying to kill myself, and I feel like my only personality trait is my trauma. Everyone knows I'm depressed, because I can't help but overshare. I feel like I burden loved ones with my thoughts and feelings. And I can't do it.

I need help.,"I can't count how many times I've tried reaching out on reddit, each time to no avail. I have no idea where else to go or what else to do. I hope someone can say something that is helpful in the slightest for once.

I can't afford to see an actual psychologist or psychiatrist. I recently discovered a place in my city that offers free counselling for certain people. After a few weeks of consideration and paranoia I finally sucked it up and went there to inquire. I almost felt proud of myself for taking that step. Then I found out there's a four month waitlist.  Fuck that. I can't wait that long. I need help now.

I live in a broken, poor city with little opportunity. I can't afford to move away. I was neglected by my parents as a child and abused as a teen. I never had a true parental figure. I have no idea what the hell I'm doing with my life. Thoughts of suicide began when I was eleven years old. I've tried to hang myself once with a belt but it broke. I have no true family aside from my grandmother. The only friends I have are long distance ones whom I met on the internet years ago and only talk to every month or so. Every romantic relationship I've been in has gone to shit by my own actions. I've developed a strong hatred for most of the people in my life as well as myself.

Overwhelming thoughts of suicide and the pain of loneliness severely hinders my ability to get anything done. I try to sit down to work on things but it just doesn't happen. I just can't. My memory has gone to shit. I can barely remember much of my childhood anymore and I probably won't remember much of what you say to me 20 minutes after you say it. My focus is non-existent. I've been having a lot of difficulty reading because I just can't focus on the words. I am currently unemployed and job-searching is horrible. My resume is pathetic. I didn't graduate high school. I hardly eat anymore and when I do it's usually cheap unhealthy food. My good habits slipped and now I hardly brush my teeth. I haven't been to the dentist in over a year but I can just feel the cavities. I lost the one thing that kept me trying to move forward. The one thing that gave me hope of a future. Now I can't see myself anywhere in the future.

There's nothing for me here. I feel so alone. Everyday I fantasize about pulling out the big chef's knife and driving it through my throat one or ten times. I just don't have the desire to go on. I know that not everyone is supposed to make it. Not everyone can make it. I genuinely feel like I am one of those people. But a small part of me still wants to live.

Im 14 and struggling a lot.,"Ive been depressed for a couple of years now, ive been suicidal too for the past 3 years. One of the main reasons is my family. I’m an outsider to them, i chose that i don’t want to be religious or what they wanted me to be. They tried to mould me into the model son, i hate it. Ive spoke on to a lot of people online, who’ve become my close friends, but in the beginning of this year, i lost my closest friend, of 3 years. He was an inspiration to me, and now that he’s gone i feel alone. I have friends still but they slowly drift further each coming day.

Recently, i was telling dark jokes as a coping mechanism, it helps relieve stress when i make jokes about stuff. I slipped up and made a joke that offended a girl in my class, she went to the head of student affairs in my school and complained about me, despite having apologised at least 5 times. Parents got involved too, and news spreads like wildfire. I don’t feel like going to school tomorrow, because the last thing i want is this stress from my peers.

Its not my peers that are the problem though, it’s my family. They’re religious and believe you should never joke about the stuff i do. (I still joke about the things i do because my mental state has deteriorated). I have depression, insomnia and ptsd. My family doesn’t know. In about an hour i have to either confess everything that’s wrong, which’ll probably give me shit to deal with x20 worse, or i can kill myself today. Im heavily weighing the options. I don’t want to live, to suffer, anymore. I’ve attempted in the past and i pussied out in the last moments. But this time, if i have to, i will. I can’t live like this anymore. I’d probably get disowned if i called the child support hotline, and i go to a private school on an academic scholarship, so i’ll have to move schools, which’d mean i’d lose my closest friends in real life.

Im pretty much failing every class, flunking every class, i don’t do work anymore, im constantly in pain. My head thumps everyday with migraines and i cant focus, i can only stay sane from my dogs and music. Im in love with videogames, but my pc died last september so i havent been able to play and it made me really sad.

Live vicariously through me,"I think about suicide all the time. I am sooooo broke, depressed, and now live in my car even though I work a full time job and do side gigs. I am my grandmothers sponsor therefore I’m financially responsible for her. It’s the only reason I’m alive. If I was gone, no one would be pay for her assisted living or even watch out for her. I love her and resent her. I’ve been thinking about suicide ever since I can remember. I don’t even remember the last time I was actually even semi happy but I’m stuck because I love her. 

If this wasn’t the case and I actually had some money, I’d go far far away. Somewhere like Tuvalu where people actually seem to care about each other. Where life moves slow and not everything involves so much technology and material things. I think that’d be the one thing that could help me with my suicidal thoughts.. just completely changing my life. 

But I can’t do that, so if you have the means to do so, why don’t you try? Don’t move to a different city.. move to a different continent. If you are planning to kill yourself, move somewhere else. Change everything. You have nothing to lose and maybe just maybe you’ll actually be happy to Alive and if so, I’d love to live vicariously through you.",ineedsleep799,3,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/fdrp1n/live_vicariously_through_me/,think suicide time sooooo broke depressed live car even though work full time job side gig grandmother sponsor therefore financially responsible reason alive wa gone one would pay assisted living even watch love resent thinking suicide ever since remember even remember last time wa actually even semi happy stuck love case actually money go far far away somewhere like tuvalu people actually seem care life move slow everything involves much technology material thing think one thing could help suicidal thought completely changing life mean try move different city move different continent planning kill move somewhere else change everything nothing lose maybe maybe actually happy alive love live vicariously,live vicariously,need sleep 799
"do you ever feel like you're always alone, even when surrounded by others?","you know how people always say ""you're lonely, not alone""? i really honestly feel like i'm just unable to become close to another human being - mutually.

i have a lot of people in my life who love me and want to be close to me. but i feel cold saying that i am either too overwhelmed by them or i don't feel close to them.

i cant bond with others anymore. i used to have stupid useless sex constantly that made me feel like a piece of meat to be consumed. now intimacy terrifies me.

closeness and hugs scare me. i'm extremely isolated and i only ever leave the house for my (extremely tough medical) school and to get food. debt is piling up because of that but its my only joy.

i cant stand people getting close to me. i cant stand hanging out with friends. but yet i want love and intimacy so badly. i feel like im so broken, and that i'm never going to feel like a human again.

i just feel like a vessel that serves as a stupid, servicing fleshlight to fuck. to only ever improve the quality of others - not me. i don't deserve it.

i just don't understand why i shouldn't just kill myself over spring break. that way if i survive, i have a week to be in the psych hospital and not miss any assignments or exams.",disasterwizard,1,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/fdp5eu/do_you_ever_feel_like_youre_always_alone_even/,know people always say lonely alone really honestly feel like unable become close another human mutually lot people life love want close feel cold saying either overwhelmed feel close cant bond others anymore used stupid useless sex constantly made feel like piece meat consumed intimacy terrifies closeness hug scare extremely isolated ever leave house extremely tough medical school get food debt piling joy cant stand people getting close cant stand hanging friend yet want love intimacy badly feel like im broken never going feel like human feel like vessel serf stupid servicing fleshlight fuck ever improve quality others deserve understand kill spring break way survive week psych hospital miss assignment exam,ever feel like always alone even surrounded others,disaster wizard

Does cutting help?,"Hey, I have a question for anyone who’s willing to answer. I just would like to know if anyone who has cut in the past, and who maybe are still cutting, does it help you in any way? Does it relive any sort of distress? I know it’s a dangerous game to play. I’m just curious. Cheers everyone! I hope you all stay in this life and continue to at least try to conquer your demons. You might not think you are loved, but you are loved by someone, and you might just be wanting someone to ask if you are ok. Milking yourself ends ANY sort of progression to get better.

Your aren't bad,"Feeling this way isn't a bad thing. Something that is said to much in our society is that feeling suicidal if a bad thing. The whole ""don't do it,"" line is just a rewording of our society sentiment towards suicide. You should just know that feeling suicidal, even to the point of writing notes and making plans isn't a bad thing. There is no shame in falling when you've been beaten. Feeling suicidal is a perfectly natural response to abuse, depression, psychosis, or any other horrible thing; you can't go near a fire without getting hot. There is nothing wrong with you for feeling suicidal, for feeling like you hate yourself. Maybe the reason you hate yourself is because you've never been loved, so you see no proof that you are worthy of any. Maybe it's because you have been abusedv so thoroughly you've been programmed to hate yourself. No matter the cause, I cannot stress this enough, it is not a bad thing.

Yesterday was one of my lowest this year. I was going to take pills and alcohol, as much as I could handle. The bottle was in my hands, when I heard my dog about to vomit.
I got up to clean it and she was stumbling around, and then passed out. I got so desperate, took her on my arms and walked 15min to the closest clinic.
I didn't even remember my plans till I got home with her at night.

She had a bunch of exams made, and is on meds and relatively better. I keep thinking that if I had took the pills I would've been at least incredibly high, and wouldn't be able to help her.

I would like to erase everything... Help,"Hello everyone,

I just don't know where to start... I'm feeling really helpless to be honest. I feel like a burden, like a parasite. Every day, pain is with me. Joy is temporary. I surrender at this point. My childhood has been a mess with my dysfunctional parents. I've never been good. If you want to have an idea, my mother has a borderline personality disorder, which means she was violent, physically and emotionally. My father is narcissistic, he abused me emotionally, making me feel like a burden. Never keeping his promises. I've never been happy for a long time with them. I'd say, for my life, 10% happy, 90% in pain. Now I'm 21, I don't know how I survived at this point, but I reached my limit. I tried to take my life away, wasn't a success. My family learned it, and for a moment I thought they finally considered me, but it was for such a short amount of time. I'm always walking on eggs with my parents. I'm in university right now, and it's hard. I just don't have the energy and will to persevere. My energy level is low, very low. I've tried therapy, meds, taking walks, doing sports. But every time I feel like I finally got my life together, something happens and it goes down. For example, I thought I could have some hope two weeks ago, then my cat died. She was my real family, I really loved her and she was always there for me, she kinda helped me a lot with her caring presence. It destroyed me. Then I tried again, but now I've got issues again with the parents. I'm exhausted. I don't have the strength to continue this life. I'm helpless. I sincerely considered ending everything this week. Its just too much for me.

I want to pursue death but I am not depressed nor suicidal,"Hello. Never really wrote about myself online but I’m very curious and the stigma behind death seems to discourage discussion of it. I’ve actively tried talking to my family and a therapist about my perception of my life but their inability to understand that it does not and never has stemmed from depression irritates me. 

I want to die. I believe that death is the ultimate end goal for every single human being and rapidly increasing its approach would lead me to the end. Please note, I have a social life. I have close friends at college and at work. I also have a pretty active socia life (I go to a couple parties here and there). I’m in a solid relationship (been together for two years now), and I do not abuse drugs or alcohol, only at kick backs or something. I do not have depression, I’m pretty laid back down to earth guy who has never had any mental illness nor any thoughts of worthlessness, extreme sadness etc. 

Personally, the meaningless within life is the main motivator for my methodology. Realistically, the now is true living (due to its value, the past you can’t change and the future is unknown). Past the now, life is to be, not happening. Work, sex, love, entertainment, etc. are used to keep individuals living but what for? We work a 9-5 job, we have kids, we do all of these things and yet the reasoning boils down to survival and entertainment. entertainment to keep us looped within an endless cycle of netflix shows or games or tv shows or youtube and survival of work to eat and feed the future generation. realistically, love is a chemical compound effect which sparks to motivate the production of kids. to continue the species. the love of a parent to a child is to prevent child hood death so the child can become a parent and produce more children for the cycle to continue. when you really boil down what life is it’s just an endless cycle of continuation within a species. 

Idk i’m just curious if anyone else feels this way. You develop your own meaning in life but that meaning isn’t even yours. You are taught that meaning through society and social interactions. Your parents develop that meaning for you and you believe it’s yours but in reality it isn’t.

I've been overeating to the point of getting sick. I've been spending days and more days barely taking care of myself, and just existing in my home, from which I barely leave for days on end.


I've been avoiding this conclusion forever, mostly because I'm so scared of it.


I don't think I want to exist.

I feel like nothing's is really worth it, and that includes myself. The thought of just ending it keeps coming over and over again, and it's getting harder and harder to fight back.


I'm scared. I feel cold and worthless. But what's worse is that I know tomorrow will be exactly the same.


I know there are people who love me and do so much for me, and I appreciate every single second they invest on me... But I've been really afraid of the idea that, even tho they try to, they can't really change things or help me in the ways that really matter in the end, like my mental condition, my traumas and the inescapable barrier that is my social class.

"I want to kill myself, but don't want ex-girlfriend to feel bad","(25M) I've been dealing with depression since I was about 14. I've been to countless therapists/doctors and have never had any relief. Throughout that time I've battled the urge to end my life and the only thing that seems to stop me is the guilt of hurting my family, in particular my mum.

I feel like such an ungrateful piece of garbage for what I've put her though and I know she deserves better than me.

She unfortunately isn't the only one. I recently ended it with my girlfriend because I couldn't stand what I was doing to her emotionally, the burden of having to deal with me day after day is exhausting and its simply not fair to ask that of her.

I've had gfs in the past but she is the only one I've ever truly loved, I genuinely believe that she is/was the one, but I can't condemn her to a life with me.
She simply deserves better. She's the most wonderful person I've ever known, and she should be with someone who can make her happy.

We were filthy peasant. After my mom died he and his family told me to marry a rich man and didn't matter if I became a hidden wife, second wife of an old man. He told me I was different from normal girl I didnt deserve a good life.

"A girl I knew commit suicide, now I want to","Preface, I'm a bit drunk rn, it helps numb this pain.

A girl I knew and I had hooked up with in the past, then became friends with commit suicide recently. We weren't close but I'd consider her a special friend to me. We rarely saw each other, but when we did we had the best banter known to man.  


I'm doing great in school, have a girlfriend, got internships lined up and was happy before this. But now, since she commit suicide, the only thing that makes sense to me is to kill myself. I've had depressive episodes before but this feels different. Everytime my thoughts are blank or I zone out, my first thought is the fact she is actually gone. Last time I tried to commit suicide was 5 years ago, and even then it wasn't this impactful.

&amp;#x200B;

For some reason this girl's suicide has really fucked with me and makes me feel like suicide is a reasonable option. It makes me feel like I have a new purpose. I feel like there is something extraordinary waiting for me. I almost feel as if she is waiting for me.

&amp;#x200B;

I got home in a cab and cried the entire way. The cab driver said nothing. I said nothing. When he looked at me I felt he had accepted my fate as I had. Perhaps there is more, perhaps there isn't. But I do want to cry more, but I'm not close enough to the girl to deserve pity.

&amp;#x200B;

As I am typing this out I feel better.  I feel as if I do not need to die right now but I do crave death. Just not at my hand. I accept being murdered, I accept an accident.

"I don't have anyone else to burden with this, so","I feel really weird doing this. I'm not good at talking about this stuff. But I have a couple reasons to think unloading anonymously might help a little.

I've been dealing with depression and suicidal thoughts for about half my life, since I was in middle school. Had a couple close calls, but had my first genuine attempt last summer.

I can't keep myself sober, and, frankly, I'm out of reasons to bother trying. I like to say I won't make another attempt because of my dad, but some days I think the real reason is because I just haven't stockpiled enough pills yet.

I’m leaving tomorrow,"For years ive been depressed and taking medication. The one thing keeping me going has been my familys encouragement and love. All my life i grew up to please my parents and do what they wanted. I realised later on that i couldnt keep doing that. I tried to kill myself then but was caught. Its been five years since then and my parents have been so loving. They tell me they dont care what i will be in the future as long as im happy. And that was what kept me going. 

A few days ago i found out from my brother that our dad told him that he compares us to the other kids his officemates boast about. He says he cant help it. He says he knows its wrong but that we cant blame him. He says he went wrong with us. With me. It shattered me

Now as im writing this, i have almost everythimg ready to go tomorrow. The last time i wa s going to die i was desperate and grieving. Now im angry and sad and theres nothing left. No matter what option i have left. I will fail. I will never be what my parents love and are proud of. They lied to me all these 5 years. I know they love me. But now i know they pity me and think im a defect produced by their parenting. 

If anyone i know finds this, please know its not your fault. I will never hate anyone more than myself. Im a coward. ive always known. To my brother, i want you to have everything i own. You can choose to throw it away or give it away. The plushies can go to dad, the makeup can go to mom. The clothes can be sold. The rest is yours. Im sorry i couldnt be the sister you admire

Thank you to everyone who inspired me and encouraged me to live on. Im sorry. Its not your fault. Its all mine.


edit: my parents heard me crying and talked to me. my mom says my problems are small and i should have a strong heart. My dad denied saying that stuff. i knocked myself out with sleeping pills but today i cant go anywhere without supervision so i guess im still alive. thank you everyone who replied, reading all of it made me cry a lot... none of you know me but you talk to me with kindness... its crazy... thank you for being here thank you",demouxx,9,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/fdcb4b/im_leaving_tomorrow/,year ive depressed taking medication one thing keeping going ha family encouragement love life grew please parent wanted realised later couldnt keep tried kill wa caught five year since parent loving tell dont care future long im happy wa kept going day ago found brother dad told compare u kid officemates boast say cant help say know wrong cant blame say went wrong u shattered im writing almost everythimg ready go tomorrow last time wa going die wa desperate grieving im angry sad nothing left matter option left fail never parent love proud lied 5 year know love know pity think im defect produced parenting anyone know find please know fault never hate anyone im coward ive always known brother want everything choose throw away give away plushies go dad makeup go mom clothes sold rest im sorry couldnt sister admire thank everyone inspired encouraged live im sorry fault mine edit parent heard cry talked mom say problem small strong heart dad denied saying stuff knocked sleeping pill today cant go anywhere without supervision guess im still alive thank everyone replied reading made cry lot none know talk kindness crazy thank thank,leaving tomorrow,demo u xx

Yesterday I turned 25 and I still wonder how I made it this far.,"I was the only thing that held their marriage or some sort together. Came to them today to have a family dinner tomorrow and they do nothing but arguing between each other over stupid shit. Guess they are so tired of each other they ain’t even faking it.

Yesterday I had a birthday party with my friends. Of course it was great, but it was mainly an attempt for me to get some Dopamine™️ through people I considered friends. We live together and I try to do shit that would bind me with them. Simple stuff, like cooking a bit, doing common household chores around the kitchen and common places, going to the drugstore when someone’s sick or stuff. But there’s no feedback. When I ask them something about where is something like a bag for cold food (don’t know how it’s called, a bag where you put frozen stuff when going to the grocery store) no one batted an eye and helped me to find it. Asked someone (by text) to get me instant ramen in store and them “Whoops, sorry, guess I forgot”. 

Same with my work. I’m treated like an everyman when almost everyone constantly forgets about shit I ask them to do and rely on. 

I feel completely alone. Not like *alone* but with no person I can rely to. My close ones make me sick. Social interaction makes me sick. My work makes me sick. My constant struggle with my mental complications make me sick. My corrupted country makes me sick. The whole world makes me sick. And now there’s some weird Chinese virus which literally makes people sick. 

I consider myself a pussy when it comes to the suicide. But I already have two attempts. Dunno when I’ll get the impulse for a third one, but I hope I would be lucky this time.",edkisin,4,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/fdha7m/yesterday_i_turned_25_and_i_still_wonder_how_i/,wa thing held marriage sort together came today family dinner tomorrow nothing arguing stupid shit guess tired even faking yesterday birthday party friend course wa great wa mainly attempt get dopamine people considered friend live together try shit would bind simple stuff like cooking bit common household chore around kitchen common place going drugstore someone sick stuff feedback ask something something like bag cold food know called bag put frozen stuff going grocery store one batted eye helped find asked someone text get instant ramen store whoop sorry guess forgot work treated like everyman almost everyone constantly forgets shit ask rely feel completely alone like alone person rely close one make sick social interaction make sick work make sick constant struggle mental complication make sick corrupted country make sick whole world make sick weird chinese virus literally make people sick consider pussy come suicide already two attempt dunno get impulse third one hope would lucky time,yesterday turned 25 still wonder made far,ed k

"I just need someone to talk to, man.","2020 is kicking my ass so bad. I got laid off in November, and a pregnancy wouldnt allow me to work until now. I got the call that im going back to work starting Saturday, but whats the use? Unemployment didnt pay enough to make rent and bills, social assistance wont help me BECAUSE im recieving Unemployment, and i was given the ""you have 14 days to pay your rent or i start the eviction process"" notice from the landlord. 
After waiting for a late payment of Unemployment to come in, and my husband and i taking everything of value to us (PS4, Switch, and even his guitar) to the pawn shop, we're a solid $60 short on rent with no income in sight for the remaining days we have to pay. 
I put my name out for emergency commissions as i figure people might go for it, but in all honesty, no one has.

I can't take this anymore,"I can't fcking take this any longer, this post probably won't help me much but I'm so desperate that I'll try anything to have a glimpse of hope. I'm so confused that I can't even write a proper text begging for help, a very simple act can become so complex and overwhelming to me.  
I'll try to write this as coherent as possible but since english isn't my main language and I seem to have lost all my intelligence, so please forgive me if It starts getting confusing.

So basically, I have no idea what to do, my depression is getting so bad that I don't see any other way out besides ending it all. I feel no pleasure what so ever, not even masturbating gives me any pleasure. I feel like shit on a daily basis, from overwhelming sadness, anxiety and rage to paranoia, overwhelming suicidal thoughts and even homicidal thoughts. I don't want to hurt anyone besides myself thought. I'm such a failure, I'm 18 and still a virgin, I'm fat and all the freaking times I joined the gym I found myself just giving up weeks later. I have no social skills, or better yet no skills AT ALL. All my life I was illuded by my teachers, parents and friends into thinking that I was smarter than average, and the worst thing is that was the only good thing I saw on me, but I'm not smart at all, I'm just a dumb piece of shit. I tried everything I could to treat my depression but nothing seems to work, meditation (minimum of 30 minutes per day), medication (multiple antipsychotics, antidepressants and benzodiazepines), psychedelic drugs (LSD, magic mushrooms, DMT, you name it I probably tried it). I go to a psychologist and psychiatrist but I feel no better, probably worse than when it all started, the worst part is that I don't even remember when and how it started. Now I wouldn't say I abuse drugs that much, I mainly smoke a bit of weed every now and then, mostly weekends, and regarding psychedelics I done them rarely and with every bit of damage reduction I could think of, perhaps I did indeed disrespect them a bit (mostly taking them without prior planning leading to uncomfortable sets and settings) since I can't enjoy them anymore, I panic and my mind instantly tells me to take xanax or any benzo I can get my hands on. However I DID abuse Xanax, so much so that I ended up on the hospital a couple times for taking too much of it and blacking out, while in school which just fucked my reputation in school. My friends tried to help me as much as they could, but my mind is so fucked and confused that nothing seems to help. This text is getting long but I still have so much to say, I'll try to not make it too long so you don't get bored quickly. My grades are down the hill, I'm currently in 12th grade and about to fail, and honestly I CAN'T stand another year at that school, I rather hang myself than go through that again, specially since I live in an isolated island in the middle of nowhere and resources are very limited here, there's nothing to do here and there's no chance I'm getting a girlfriend here (or anywhere to be honest, nobody would love a fat piece of shit like me).

Life is unbearable, I see no reason to stay alive, all I do all day is playing fcking LoL and let me tell you I hate that game so much, makes my blood boil and gives me urges to just cut my wrists. I can't make basic math/physics/chemistry/etc.. which just makes me feel even worst, cuz I need it to get to college, but I don't understand shit in school, since I can't study or focus, my mind just bombards me with horrible thoughts that echo in my mind till I put myself to sleep, I have no control over my mind anymore. I started learning guitar, and ended up giving up. I tried to learn how to program, but It's too overwhelming and I'm starting to lose any motivation I had for it (not that I had much motivation in general).

Here's some backstory, when I was a kid I got shot in my eye with a air pressure carabine, which left me with about 10% vision on said eye, made me get fat cuz I couldn't do exercise for about 2-3 years and I ended up getting a bad lifestyle in general, all day in computer playing games. This combined with more trauma I went throught and my midly toxic family, lead to me becoming the disgusting person I could think of. I know this is getting too much information and confusing please forgive me, I'm retarded.

Right now all I can think of is how to kill myself, I've tried it before with pills but ended up failing, so this time I'm thinking of hanging myself, and will do it eventually.

Just thinking of all this makes my blood boil, I Hate life so much, I hate my fucking family, I hate my fucking school, I hate myself, I wanna shoot myself in the head and end it all.",Joanh9000,0,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/fdlzds/i_cant_take_this_anymore/,fcking take longer post probably help much desperate try anything glimpse hope confused even write proper text begging help simple act become complex overwhelming try write coherent possible since english main language seem lost intelligence please forgive start getting confusing basically idea depression getting bad see way besides ending feel pleasure ever even masturbating give pleasure feel like shit daily basis overwhelming sadness anxiety rage paranoia overwhelming suicidal thought even homicidal thought want hurt anyone besides thought failure 18 still virgin fat freaking time joined gym found giving week later social skill better yet skill life wa illuded teacher parent friend thinking wa smarter average worst thing wa good thing saw smart dumb piece shit tried everything could treat depression nothing seems work meditation minimum 30 minute per day medication multiple antipsychotic antidepressant benzodiazepine psychedelic drug lsd magic mushroom dmt name probably tried go psychologist psychiatrist feel better probably worse started worst part even remember started say abuse drug much mainly smoke bit weed every mostly weekend regarding psychedelics done rarely every bit damage reduction could think perhaps indeed disrespect bit mostly taking without prior planning leading uncomfortable set setting since enjoy anymore panic mind instantly tell take xanax benzo get hand however abuse xanax much ended hospital couple time taking much blacking school fucked reputation school friend tried help much could mind fucked confused nothing seems help text getting long still much say try make long get bored quickly grade hill currently 12th grade fail honestly stand another year school rather hang go specially since live isolated island middle nowhere resource limited nothing chance getting girlfriend anywhere honest nobody would love fat piece shit like life unbearable see reason stay alive day playing fcking lol let tell hate game much make blood boil give urge cut wrist make basic math physic chemistry etc make feel even worst cuz need get college understand shit school since study focus mind bombard horrible thought echo mind till put sleep control mind anymore started learning guitar ended giving tried learn program overwhelming starting lose motivation much motivation general backstory wa kid got shot eye air pressure carabine left 10 vision said eye made get fat cuz exercise 2 3 year ended getting bad lifestyle general day computer playing game combined trauma went throught midly toxic family lead becoming disgusting person could think know getting much information confusing please forgive retarded right think kill tried pill ended failing time thinking hanging eventually thinking make blood boil hate life much hate fucking family hate fucking school hate wanna shoot head end,take anymore,joan h 9000
Do the suicidal thoughts ever really end?,"I’ve been combatting them for years and they are so strong they prevent me from being a functional member of society. I’ve (sort of) attempted suicide twice within the last 8 years. And I wish I just went more balls deep with it when I did. 

I’ve been inpatient in mental hospitals, I’ve done IOP programs, PHP programs, DBT, CBT, etc. for over 13 years and even after following all of these things I’ve learned, the suicidal thoughts always win. I’ve been on prescription after prescription and some may help lessen the frequency but they never actually go away. 

I can’t tell my therapist (or any professional) these things because I’ll instantly be admitted. I’m already $1000+ in debt with medical bills from hospitalizations and therapy, and I can’t afford another useless admission. All hospitalizations are is just a cash grab and a reason to house suicidal people and bankrupt them while profiting off of their health insurance. 

I don’t even have the energy or willpower to go to work anymore. But my boss will fire me if I miss another day of work. But I can’t go to the doctors to get a doctor’s note or provide any excuse as to why I didn’t come in or else I’ll be hospitalized. I don’t care if I get evicted and lose my cats and all my belongings and have to live out of my car. I just can’t function in a work environment when feeling this way. 

It just feels like a vicious circle/catch 22 that I can’t seem to fucking break. Everyone around me just calls me weak and leaves me because I’m such a burden. I’ve always had this small fear in me of the “killing myself” process - the fear of feeling my skull hit the pavement if I jump off of a building; or the fear of feeling myself asphyxiating as a noose constricts all blood flow and airflow to my brain; or the fear of feeling all my organs shut down before my brain does if I overdose. But lately, those fears are becoming less and less of an issue where I’d rather just bite the bullet and be done with it.",UglyStru,2,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/fdrjax/do_the_suicidal_thoughts_ever_really_end/,combatting year strong prevent functional member society sort attempted suicide twice within last 8 year wish went ball deep inpatient mental hospital done iop program php program dbt cbt etc 13 year even following thing learned suicidal thought always win prescription prescription may help lessen frequency never actually go away tell therapist professional thing instantly admitted already 1000 debt medical bill hospitalization therapy afford another useless admission hospitalization cash grab reason house suicidal people bankrupt profiting health insurance even energy willpower go work anymore bos fire miss another day work go doctor get doctor note provide excuse come else hospitalized care get evicted lose cat belonging live car function work environment feeling way feel like vicious circle catch 22 seem fucking break everyone around call weak leaf burden always small fear killing process fear feeling skull hit pavement jump building fear feeling asphyxiating noose constricts blood flow airflow brain fear feeling organ shut brain doe overdose lately fear becoming le le issue rather bite bullet done,suicidal thought ever really end,ugly tru
He cancelled our wedding 4 months away from the date...,"I dont know what to do anymore. I was 4 months away from getting married to my best friend of 10 yrs! He says he doesn't know what he wants . Everything was fine. He was actively planning the wedding with me, calling me his fiancee and handing out save the dates. He says he needs time, so I left the house and next week it'll be 1 month of our separation. Everyone is saying ""its better that it happened now vs later"" but it still hurts like hell. I ask for a reason to all of this and he says he doesnt know himself. He posts on instagram that he had to use 100% of his energy to let me go and that i will be happier with someone else. But the thing is I dont want anyone else and i will always choose him. I told him that and he doesnt say anything except not to push him. I love him so much and my heart feels like its going to explode and i feel like dying everyday! I know there are worse things that are happening in the world, and i feel stupid for saying this but i would rather die than to be without him. Not all relationships are perfect, yes we had our issues but we always found a way to work it out. This time around it really CAME OUT OF NO WHERE, it literally blindsided me. I feel crushed and i find myself just going through the motions as to not alarm my family, but I just cant do it anymore.

Pretty high rn and just wanna empty some thoughts somewhere,"I hate who I am. I've lived a perfectly good life, had loving parents, was never bullied, whatever. Right now I have plenty of friends, a decent social life. I have no excuse for feeling how I feel and I just constantly beat myself up for it. Yet here we are, me just doing drugs every night and eating shitty food in the hopes that they'll kill me faster. Pretty much given up on college, no clue how I'm ever gonna graduate, but not like it matters since I'm not doing anything with my life anyway. Next phase is to get some dead end job till death finally comes. Not much to look forward to. Would have offed myself long ago if it wasn't for my parents, I can't give them the pain of losing their only child to suicide. I also don't wanna hurt my friends, but I'm doing a pretty good job of distancing myself from them so that probably won't be an issue in the future. Living for others sucks, but I mean, what other choice do I have?  I'm definitely not gonna live for myself when the time comes.

So here I am just patiently waiting death. For the most part I've stopped feeling anything. Some days (today) it just hits me like a train, but I usually wake up, just lumber through the whole day doing what's ""expected"" of me, all fake smiles and funny jokes to make people think that I'm normal. Then I come back, waste time with videos games or drugs, sleep, rinse and repeat. I've tried to start a hobby, but I always lose motivation, try to talk to people, but only exchange empty words. Don't see my condition improving in any way (not like it's possible anyway). Life sucks, it always has and always will. I just really hope that I don't get the chance to make it to 30 years.

I despise this cycle, I hate that you're forced to participate, and I hate that people tell you that you're the one with ""a problem"" for thinking that things shouldn't be this way. Isn't it cruel to keep someone in misery when relief is so easily available? But of course, forcing them to suffer is obviously the moral choice here. So I guess suffer I will, cause apparently society decided that this was the right choice. 

In short, all I'm looking forward to is the day that I'll be able to kill myself guilt free, hope it'll come sooner rather than later.",MatchaPrecciated,3,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/fdr9l9/pretty_high_rn_and_just_wanna_empty_some_thoughts/,hate lived perfectly good life loving parent wa never bullied whatever right plenty friend decent social life excuse feeling feel constantly beat yet drug every night eating shitty food hope kill faster pretty much given college clue ever gonna graduate like matter since anything life anyway next phase get dead end job till death finally come much look forward would offed long ago parent give pain losing child suicide also wanna hurt friend pretty good job distancing probably issue future living others suck mean choice definitely gonna live time come patiently waiting death part stopped feeling anything day today hit like train usually wake lumber whole day expected fake smile funny joke make people think normal come back waste time video game drug sleep rinse repeat tried start hobby always lose motivation try talk people exchange empty word see condition improving way like possible anyway life suck always ha always really hope get chance make 30 year despise cycle hate forced participate hate people tell one problem thinking thing way cruel keep someone misery relief easily available course forcing suffer obviously moral choice guess suffer cause apparently society decided wa right choice short looking forward day able kill guilt free hope come sooner rather later,pretty high rn wanna empty thought somewhere,matcha pre cci ted
I won't be able to withstand this forever,"I just finished half of my current career... Pretty much four semesters, and almost nothing has changed.

Being honest, I've been trying to hold on for three and a half years after that Asperger misdiagnosis, but eventually it becomes unbearable... I keep thinking that some people treat me in a more child like way, or as if I were disabled, or just talking to me when we are face or face or for college stuff, but no more than that.

My mom has been trying to understand, but she says it's difficult, because she's a more self sufficient person, and she doesn't understand why I'm so obsessed with friendship.

Now I'll go to my psychologist in a few days, and I don't know how to make her understand as well... Sometimes, I think my problem isn't something that can be fixed by just believing in myself.

It's the main reason I want to die, it's the main reason I lost a lot of things and people in these past years... It destroyed my life, and I don't know how to make my mom and psychologist understand that.

I don't think I'll be able to withstand that forever. For now I can, but I feel that if the future will be the same, eventually I'll break down or have a nervous breakdown...

Please Help,"Hey guys,

so this is a throwaway account for reasons...

Anyways, I'm a freshman in high school and overall, I have pretty decent grades and I play violin (since preschool) and do sports. I have an extremely caring an overall amazing boyfriend, and an awesome friend who I basically consider as an older brother.

I have nothing to live for. My mother is verbally abusive, and when I call out for help with the few close friends I have left, she says I'm lying and she'll call me out and ruin my life. Now, I don't even know if I'm lying or not. If I am, just ignore this then. I really don't know anymore. Everyday, I'm so confused. I have no right to be proud of anything, and because I go to a really tough high school, often I don't have the time to practice violin (but I do a lot of competitions and honor orch, etc. so yeah not good) and yanno, college applications are coming up and I don't think I have anything to show. I do homework during class so I can finally relax during lunch, but I tell my mom I do homework during lunch to avoid getting my ass kicked. She compulsively checks my phone and reads my texts (more than I have my phone, her reason is that my parents bought it and not me), goes through my stuff and takes it, then tells me she did nothing of the sort, and yet I'm the crazy horrible reputation ruining liar here. I guess I don't even know if I am?

I'm just so tired of it all. I know that there's things to look forward to and live for, but I feel nothing for it. I've had suicidal thoughts and depression and whatever and my mom is saying I'm lying and making it up. I just don't know what to do, because even though I'm just a teenager, I could probably say my boyfriend is the only person I'd want to spend life with if things work out (I've dated before and so has he). But as of now, I'm giving everyone aneurysms or something dealing with me and getting mad at me. My violin and sports are doing basically nothing because I don't have time or energy and this generation is pretty damn good at this stuff. The only thing keeping me alive is the fact that I know my boyfriend probably would have a really hard time dealing with the fact that I was gone, for a very long time. I've been debating ending the relationship to make it easier on him.

I'm sorry, I don't know what to ask of y'all. Just please help me. I'm talked out. I just don't know anymore. Everytime someone tries to help everything honestly just gets worse. I don't have the energy or the will to eat, or function, tbh.",emptywishes007,1,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/fdr971/please_help/,hey guy throwaway account reason anyways freshman high school overall pretty decent grade play violin since preschool sport extremely caring overall amazing boyfriend awesome friend basically consider older brother nothing live mother verbally abusive call help close friend left say lying call ruin life even know lying ignore really know anymore everyday confused right proud anything go really tough high school often time practice violin lot competition honor orch etc yeah good yanno college application coming think anything show homework class finally relax lunch tell mom homework lunch avoid getting kicked compulsively check phone read text phone reason parent bought go stuff take tell nothing sort yet crazy horrible reputation ruining liar guess even know tired know thing look forward live feel nothing suicidal thought depression whatever mom saying lying making know even though teenager could probably say boyfriend person want spend life thing work dated ha giving everyone aneurysm something dealing getting mad violin sport basically nothing time energy generation pretty damn good stuff thing keeping alive fact know boyfriend probably would really hard time dealing fact wa gone long time debating ending relationship make easier sorry know ask please help talked know anymore everytime someone try help everything honestly get worse energy eat function tbh,please help,empty wish 007
Can’t stop my mind,I think every night I wish I wouldn’t wake up. I thought the divorce would help the feelings. I thought therapy would help. I thought pills would help. But everyday is sad and all consuming. I can’t think about anything other than my situation or killing myself often at the same time. I’m so tired of the next day coming. Finding myself praying to find the courage to do it vs the courage to not do it.

My story,"Last year I was a freshman in highshighschool. Near the end I was ready. I was gonna do it then one of the people told my mom and got me help. I told 3 people john, alex, and gabriel. Kohn said he would help me but lied. Alex did nothing and gabriel helped me. A few nights ago john texted me. This is our conversation.



John: I know you hate and despise me with a passion, But I must ask, Why? I just kinda needed some clearence. I'm not here to pick a fight with you, but to come to an understanding, So looks like u have spent 10 mins typing, I guess I can expect a bomb drop on me or som.

Me: I was on the verge of suicide and u said u would do something u promised and I hoped deep down someone would I was going to kill my fucking self on the 13 of july that year stab in the heart with a fuckin knife u promised me someone who I dispite all other judgement thought was a good if not the closest friend I had u did nothing u would've let me die it was gabriel the one who I thought wouldn't give a shit because of all the shit we went through it was him who got me the fucking help I hate u so fuck much so so much with all my fucking heart every muscle and bone and tendon and bit of flesh burns with hatred when i even think about u and the worst part is i cant unthink it I cant just forget an entire year cause I fuckin would forget u exist forget the entirety of 8th grade then some more u go around saying oh jay was just faking it he wanted the attention I was going to fuckin die and u were gonna sit there and watch with ur thumb up ur ass like some sorta fuckin beast of the fields then u come back to me and ask what I did wrong why do u hate me like that's a question then ur not even gonna say sorry u weren't just a shitty friend ur a shitty person and I made it my mission now to stop people from making the same mistake I did trusting u fuck I was a goddamn idiot but it doesn't even matter now I know where everyone stands when I asked them to pick a side a while back and they said they were with me only to lie and be with u I know now I only hate 3 things u Hitler and satan and u u didnt even do just that u hit ur brother u shot at me with a bb gun u hit my head with a bat and each time I tried to be a friend have someone by myside thought it would be u guess not then theres ur sarcasm again and I could keep going but ur rushing me so here


John: Well holy shit That was... Okay look man I'm honestly speechless But I need you to understand my perception I thought that you were just up to ur usual antics and I thought u were begging for attention, and I decided to not give you that attention. You aren't gonna believe me but I am honestly truly sorry if you felt and continue to feel this way I mean I never wanted any of this, I was led to believe that you had gone mad and I had to leave it at there Suicide is stupid by the way, I have considered that for myself in the past and I'm telling you it does not go well because those who have acted on that literally destroy their loved ones. You need to understand that I never wanted to hurt you in the way that you felt I just thought it was a bucket of bullshit, but I know realize you needed help Look I wanna clear the air here, I know you'll never consider me friend and that you hate my guts, but I want to make my peace with you and I want you to understand that I never hated you, and I am a man who believes in redemption There's nothing I can do, you clearly are a broken individual, I pray for your healing and I hope god watches you I hope that you seek help and that you talk to someone about this

Me: Horse shit

John: Ik that's what you think

Me: Need I continue Or do u wanna talk in person

John: Look man all I can say is god bless your soul, may his angels watch you, may you be free of this cursed darkness, and if you wanna talk in person I'm totally up for that

Me: Tomorrow freshman bathrooms by the commons around a lunch

John: I have a class I need to attend for and my schedule is kinda tight, but I could tomorrow morning at the main commons or som I believe you and I have a shared friend, Jake Maybe he could be present as we hash things out 

Me: No This is a u and me thing Fuck class

John: Of course, but listen if you wanna reach me, I'm around in the mornings or C lunch period

Me: Fuck that then

John: I kinda got fucked with the tardies rn so... I mean I'm open to discussing with you 

Me: Fuck ok 

John: I just need a time that works for both of us

Me: I'm just gonna say it all here

John: I can get on call if you like?

Me: Cant

John: Aight Then ig you just tell me here

Me: Shortened version 

Beginning of 9th grade I was completely alone u guys who were supposed to be my fuckin friends ran from me knew no one talked to no one only friend I had was jd and hes an ass on his own lowering my self esteem and all this went on for a month finally when I caught hold of u I invited u all to my birthday where everyone fucked off on their own leaving me once again alone to top that off all 3 of u alex gabriel and u tried to leave then homecoming where my past finally caught up to me I met someone we went on a date and it was ok I got to the house only to find some cunt who left the group who u took the place of and he told them everything about me how I hurt people without remorse and how I would so it again and how I was dangerous and shit they knew and I went with them they tried confronting me about it but I lied I hate liars and I lied to make that worse she was with someone else and I couldn't do shit about it when I go over to look for u bing notification everyone except me with the caption only friends I need or something I didnt have a ride home so I went back each question getting more and more personal until my dad came where I had to lie to him too and mom I knew I was alone then thought for a while then the idea slipped in for all but a second talked myself out ended the semester kicked out of 4 groups and our relationship starting to tear

Second half dad beat me mom beat me I wasnt doing well anywhere I went I was getting called a school shooter mick was getting away with everything and I was constantly at the bottom always mom thinks I'm gay humiliates me to the point of breaking down telling her I'm not only to find out later she didnt believe me start to lose friends over time get kicked out of sam billings table and im alone idea slips in I think on it for a bit longer before talking myself out again dad moves to Arizona leaving mom stressed jd convinces me I'm not a good person I give him a peice of my mind we dont talk for a bit I get in a fight lose and get made fun of for it the idea is set now stuck in my head I'm going to do this i need to mom humiliates me further but apologizes I know it's fake I say to myself I should probably tell the fuckers so they aren't blindsided gabriel snitches later that night and I have a difficult conversation with mom concerning my mental health I go to therapy over the summer

This year I come to school knowing jake over summer hoping I have at least lunch but no I no nobody I'm alone again I see Sam's tables broken up over schedules I say not again and assemble what I can every other persons telling me I'm gay kill myself or something I know I need to keep loving myself even if I'm alone then I get word that u were telling people I  was saying I was going to kill myself for attention then the switch flipped I hate u always will I will never forgive u gabriel or alex never I bullshat my way into Jake's friend Austin's life stayed there expanded my group 

Now after thinking to myself why I'm even trying I realize u dont care ur a self centered asshole I had my fair share of toxicity but u took the cake and it was my fault for inviting u to the table now I see some freshman showing the same mannerisms as u and I know I need to stop it because u were a good friend but then u stopped and I dont understand that I don't get it why it doesn't matter the only one u care about is u and u will do anything to make sure u are ok or u come out on top like u have been but it doesn't matter I have the first real friend I had in a while a trustworthy group of friends and a gf lifes uphill only problem is u and I'm stuck on that cant shake it u aren't a good person idk if its u lashing out because of the divorce or u just think ur better than others or what anyways every part of my body wants u to burn in hell 
If that's too much to read listen to creep humility and magic city

John: I finished it all It was alot but I read it I don't what to say So you think I'm some narcisstic prick So much self pity man, and I have to say this really isnt healthy 

Me: Typical I said what I had to

John: You may not be able to forgive me, but you need to understand that this is not how any human being should live I wouldnt wish how you feel on my worst enemy

Me: I look for the good in everything I cant find any in u I said what i had to

John: I know Again you may think I'm some prideful narcisstic son on a bitch, but I do care about people, especially for those who are broken

Me: U are Look in a mirror and think long and hard about urself

John: I mean thats only how you view me There are millions of ways different people who see you You think I'm a bad man, and I accept your thoughts, I mean thats not who I am, but if thats the picture you painted then I'm sorry

Me: I'm an asshole that's how 80% of people see me and I'm ok with that But ask any one

John: My advice to you is find a light, be free, never let the pain, the darkness determine who you are

Me: Tell them answer honestly Dont therapize me

John: I'm happy that you met Jake, he is a truly great friend and is very supportive, I'm glad that you have someone like him in your life

Me: Fuck off with ur therapeutic bullshit

John: I'm not being your therapist, but the more you hang on to this hate and anger, than life will just be a major bummer I mean ur stubborn man

Me: Thing is I want to forgive and forget But I cant

John: And you can Thats ur choice

Me: U may be sorry now

John: U can let go of it all

Me: But that doesn't fix what ubdid U did*

John: What I did? Its all in ur head

Me:  I will never forgive u

John: You painted this fucked up picture of me

Me: Or alex Or gabriel I will not because theres no good in u We all see ourselves as saints and our enemies as devils

John: I'm not your enemy

Me: To me ur just the shittyiest of shitty people U are John U are

John: Than thats a u problem

Me: U were about to let me die After u promised to be with me Then u lie

John: First of all suicide is an option and I never advised you to do that

Me: I told u And gabriel And alex Only u 3

John: What was I supposed to do?  Did you want me to call a hotline or som?

Me: U were supposed to be my friend Just be my friend But u didnt and u cant and u won't

John: I wanted to be your friend, and I'm sorry that I decided to not even say anything That I took ur claims as an attention stunt

Me: U say sorry now because I explained U arent Dont kid urself 

John: Your in a dark dark place, and I feel very sorry for you, your broken and fucked up and all I can do is wish you the best Jay

Me: Were I'm not anymore I was in a dark place Things are fucked up Yes but that's gonna help later Gammbette jay gammbette and be kensuki Words I tell myself every morning Gammbette do your best in try in Japanese Kensuki the art of using gold to repair broken things Ik I'm broken but I'm fixing myself Something I would recommend u do

John: Well again thats a u issue Nothing I can do about that

Me: I can't do shit about that Change my view I'm just gonna let u know rn I mean every word I say

John: So ig we are not on good terms? And cannot change it

Me: I hate u and cant forgive u I'm sorry But what you did to me I cant forgive

This is why I want to kill myself... Considering doing it tonight,"I'm nearly 23 years old. My father abandoned our family when I was 14. He was my best friend at the time... I haven't seen him in 6 years. This void made me become extremely close to my few friends. My clinginess reached a point where they got fed up from me and my anxiety and paranoia, that I've now lost my closest friends. I used to reach out to them for help, but it reached a point where everything was on their shoulders and they couldn't handle it anymore, so they distanced themselves with time.  
I used to be more fit and more attractive, but my life has taken a downwards spiral. I've gained about 70 lbs and my self-consciousness eats me up on the inside. My anxiety is through the roof and I have no motivation to do anything anymore. I'm on anxiety meds but truly think I should be on anti-depressants. I am now failing out of school and I don't have the heart to tell my mother. It will break her, but also I know that once she finds out, my life will probably turn into more of a hell, as she's always had extremely high standards for me. 

I'm still a virgin. I've never had a girlfriend. I was seeing this girl when I was 17, but that was about it. And that was at my peak attractiveness. It is now laughable how unattractive I am. People will literally laugh at me because of my appearance. My self-confidence is inexistent. I get anxiety attacks when people just look at me because I think that they are judging me on how I look. I can't deal with this anymore.

I moved away from my hometown 3 years ago for university. I haven't made a single new friend. I live alone. I literally don't use my voice anymore because I have no one to talk to. It reaches the point where I talk to myself because I'm scared that if I go without talking for so long that I will lose my voice. The only time I used to use my voice was while playing video-games online, it was the only thing that brought me a bit of joy. But my console broke, and I can't afford to fix it.

I have no ambitions. I don't know what I want to do in life. Everyone around me seems to have it figured out. Meanwhile, I'm a loser that is eating his life away. The only future I envision having is honestly the one where I throw myself off of my apartment building. I think about just ending it all the time. 

I feel alone in this world, and I don't have the motivation nor the self-confidence to do anything about it. The only people that may care about me are the couple family members I have, but I have put them under so much shit for all of the stuff I've done in the past that they are fed up with me. I want to kill myself, I just want to fall asleep and never wake up.",LukerTheDuker,2,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/fdo69f/this_is_why_i_want_to_kill_myself_considering/,nearly 23 year old father abandoned family wa 14 wa best friend time seen 6 year void made become extremely close friend clinginess reached point got fed anxiety paranoia lost closest friend used reach help reached point everything wa shoulder handle anymore distanced time used fit attractive life ha taken downwards spiral gained 70 lb self consciousness eats inside anxiety roof motivation anything anymore anxiety med truly think anti depressant failing school heart tell mother break also know find life probably turn hell always extremely high standard still virgin never girlfriend wa seeing girl wa 17 wa wa peak attractiveness laughable unattractive people literally laugh appearance self confidence inexistent get anxiety attack people look think judging look deal anymore moved away hometown 3 year ago university made single new friend live alone literally use voice anymore one talk reach point talk scared go without talking long lose voice time used use voice wa playing video game online wa thing brought bit joy console broke afford fix ambition know want life everyone around seems figured meanwhile loser eating life away future envision honestly one throw apartment building think ending time feel alone world motivation self confidence anything people may care couple family member put much shit stuff done past fed want kill want fall asleep never wake,want kill considering tonight,luke r duke r

The man I want to marry is breaking my heart and I just can't do this.,"We have been together for almost four years and I had never been happier in my life than I have been since I met him.  He has helped and encouraged me to improve and grow so much.  He has never insulted me, never yelled at me, and while we've had disagreements we've never *fought*.  There has always been so much love here.

I want to spend the rest of my life with him.  I thought he wanted the same.  He says that he does.

However, he also says that he can't be satisfied sexually with just me.  He wants an open relationship so he can fool around with cis men.  I'm transgender, and it's killing me that he wants the one body part that I don't have more than he wants to be happy with me.

He doesn't believe our relationship is sustainable, and he can't promise he won't one day be tempted to cheat, if he doesn't ""have this outlet.""  He won't marry me unless I can agree to the open relationship.  I'm a deeply monogamous person and just can't do it.  I can't.

I never believed that anyone could love me; I have multiple sclerosis and am trans, along with a ton of other issues.  He has made me so happy, and I felt so loved and secure, just to learn that he isn't satisfied with me and never will be.  As I always feared, I'm just not good enough.

We're in couples counseling, he wants to make things work somehow, but I can't see any possible solution even though I want nothing more than him.  I hate my body more than ever before.  I hate myself.

How can I help?,"I’ve been *somewhat* suicidal myself. More so in the “Im in so much pain I want to stop existing” than having a plan to end it all kind of way. 

I love someone dearly who has attempted suicide more than once and been hospitalized after their attempts. They also struggle with addiction.

I’ve also lost someone I love to suicide. 

They’ve called me, more than once, often drunk or high, sometimes not, telling me goodbye, this was the end, and this was their plan (I don’t know if specific phrases are allowed, so to generalize, the gist is I have all I need to kill myself readily accessible/I am in the location where I’m going to kill my self and when we hang up I’m going to do it) 

Sometimes, I’m close enough that I can physically go to be with them. Sometimes I’m not. 

Every time, I feel like their life is in my hands. That’s not a responsibility I feel like I can handle. If something were to happen to them, I’d feel entirely responsible. 

I feel like I’ve read so much that suggestions to seek professional help aren’t helpful and the last thing to do is call the police or emergency services... but I am so scared. I love my friend and I want them to know it. I want them to know how truly I support them and don’t blame them for what they’re feeling or think they’re doing anything wrong. Because I truly don’t.

But I can’t handle feeling like their life is in my hands. I can’t handle feeling like if I say the wrong thing or don’t say the RIGHT thing and they die, it’s on me because I’m the one they chose to come to for help. I feel like I can’t be the help in these situations, but I don’t want to turn them away when they clearly need someone. 

It would be different if it wasn’t an active plan. I’m comfortable with I want to die sentiments. I’m comfortable with listening to someone talk about their deep pain and hatred towards themselves or ambivalence towards life. But the goodbye. The plan. The “I’m dead after we hang up” .... I don’t know what I’m supposed to do. I feel like I HAVE to take that seriously, because if I don’t, and they die... I have no words for what would come next.

Anyway. Any advice about any of this is appreciated.",howdoigethisright,0,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/fdnt8n/how_can_i_help/,somewhat suicidal im much pain want stop existing plan end kind way love someone dearly ha attempted suicide hospitalized attempt also struggle addiction also lost someone love suicide called often drunk high sometimes telling goodbye wa end wa plan know specific phrase allowed generalize gist need kill readily accessible location going kill self hang going sometimes close enough physically go sometimes every time feel like life hand responsibility feel like handle something happen feel entirely responsible feel like read much suggestion seek professional help helpful last thing call police emergency service scared love friend want know want know truly support blame feeling think anything wrong truly handle feeling like life hand handle feeling like say wrong thing say right thing die one chose come help feel like help situation want turn away clearly need someone would different active plan comfortable want die sentiment comfortable listening someone talk deep pain hatred towards ambivalence towards life goodbye plan dead hang know supposed feel like take seriously die word would come next anyway advice appreciated,help,doi get right

My story (incomplete),"Similar story here, OP. In my case my dad spent my childhood promising to *help* me pursue a science career if I moved in with him, along with many other exorbitant promises. He then coaxed me into signing my life savings over to him under the guise of him teaching me money management skills. Afterwards his personality instantly changed like he had been replaced with a body snatcher:

He started holding my money hostage to control me. He forced me into a flat earth fundamentalist church. He started incessantly discouraging my scientific interests. I was forbidden from me from even being seen with a girl since it might lead others to think we were sexually active. He threatened to cut me off if I ever associated with members of so many demographics that I was functionally unable to have friends. He would scream at me and belittle and humiliate me for hours every day. His church was so strict that I had to give up most of my hobbies for being ""sinful"". He tried to damage my relationships with all of my other family members. He would constantly follow me around and would incessantly act out for attention so much that I struggled to even attempt my schoolwork or even my remaining hobbies. I was quickly so psychologically broken that I started failing my classes despite growing up an honors student. 

A few years later, I took on a second major hoping to raise my GPA and just barely squeak into grad school. Dad took this to somehow mean that I was ""on the verge of graduating with two PhDs"". He completely flipped from incessantly discouraging me to exerting 24/7 pressure to graduate with those two PhDs *immediately*. I explained over and over that I wasn't getting two PhDs, but he wouldn't accept it. Despite my protests he spread word far and wide about my ""two PhDs"" and I gained a reputation as some kind of miracle prodigy that I could never actually live up to. By this point Dad was in the final stages of terminal heart problems and was so relentless in his pressure that I started going along with it because even after all his years of lies and abuse I didn't want to disappoint him on his death bed.

Years went by and things continued to get worse for me. I was overwhelmed with preemptive grief over dad's impending death every day. I went through a traumatic religious deconversion and lost my soul-sustaining (nonfundamentalist) faith in God. I started experiencing severe diabetes symptoms. I was struggling with the increased course load and failing to recover my grades as Dad continued to sink deeper and deeper into an obsession with those completely imaginary PhDs. One day dad started taking me to visit some old man from his crazy cult who was bedridden from his own terminal heart problems. 

More years went by and both dad and the old guy were both alive. That meant that Dad had been in the final stages of terminal illness for something like 6 years. I realized that he had been outrageously exaggerating his health problems and that I had spent the last several of them going along with his delusional nonsense

Stress and loneliness are dragging me down again,"After 29 years of being a shut in, sometimes having social anxiety so bad that I couldn't step out my house or go near the windows, mental health so bad that i couldn't work or finish school, I decided to go back to school. I'm dependent on a longtime SO and it makes me feel awful. There have been elements of abuse in the past and I dont think I can fully trust anyone, so I have to do this or die or get a high paying job without a degree or hurting my back(I have a terrible back and neurological problems) I'll be left with something like stripping, or just suicide.

&amp;nbsp;

At this point, classes are getting more intense, I'm already behind in an online class that posted no deadlines, because I'm prioritizing a class in which I work around 30 hours/week to keep my quality high(I'm aiming for A's and this class is supposedly graded harshly-so far I have A's and 1 B on something I worked on for just 10 hours). Anyway, so I am behind in my online classes now, trying to make time to catch up, but seems impossible.  

&amp;nbsp;

My other in person class doesn't take as much time, I have a 4 hour studio and homework takes me maybe 1-5 hours usually. I have trouble managing time because I hardly see my SO, so when we do see each other, we stay up late and just play games. We havent had any intimacy in about a month, and otherwise it's like a 1-2x/month thing. He doesn't help me with the chores unless I ask a bunch of times even though i made a chore chart for us both to look at,on the fridge, and gave myself more things. He keeps promising he'll do chores,shower,brush his teeth, just basic things, and he doesn't. He actually said he'd do all the chores when I went back to school(like I'd done for him) and not to worry. I worried, but I left things for a bit and realized I was correct in being concerned after the house started looking trashed. If I talk to him he changes the topic or recites some meme. He kisses me maybe twice a day and is otherwise glued to his phone watching YouTube videos- he quit video games as they were time consuming but just switched to videos instead. He's so addicted to his phone that he got his by a bus last year, while I was passenger. He's usually on his phone while driving and there's nothing I can do. I dont drive because of my anxiety, and I dont have a working car. I am very stressed right now and feel totally alone. 
&amp;nbsp;

I literally dont have time to see a therapist. I dont even have time to see my doctors for checkups. All I do is work, at school,homework,and at home. I am painfully shy and awkward and have no friends. I've joined a few clubs to make friends but it seems impossible; people try to befriend me it seems, and I just don't know how to interact.  I had an amazing conversation with another top performer in my class with the difficult work and anticipated becoming friends- she tries, but I dont know how to reciprocate and I can tell that I make things uncomfortable because I react as if we never started forming a friendship, if that makes sense. 

&amp;nbsp;

In my other class there is one kid who has tried to befriend me. He has autism and comes across pretty brash. I try to remind myself that he has a condition and to not take things personally, but sometimes I can't help it and I feel terrible and other times he is just too close and I feel awkward. I think he seems genuinely friendly and most of the time I dont mind him, but I guess I'm just under so much stress at this point that everything is getting to me. The whole class is also pretty distracting, which again, is usually bearable but the stress is wearing me out and there's 0 things I can do to relieve it.

&amp;nbsp;

Yesterday I got a grade back from a quiz and just a friendly note to try to speak up more during critique(I'm a design student, so this is an art class). I made a mental note to make sure to speak up during critique last night, and then I panicked. First I panicked because I wanted to be done my painting beforehand- I hadn't planned properly and am always the slow one in everything, so I kept messing up and didn't finish in time. It seemed I was one of 2 others who hadn't finished so that made me feel a little better. Critique came and the aforementioned kid stood next to me as he always does, uncomfortably close, and then in front of me and I couldn't see the paintings. Panic increased and I didn't want to be rude so I didn't say anything. I planned for what shouldve been my painting for critique and was called out of order and further panicked. 
&amp;nbsp;

I have a disorder that causes dissociation under stress and I have social anxiety. So when I panic, my mind goes blank. This happened a few days ago; my dog is unfortunately aggressive with 1 dog in my neighborhood. She is a strong dog and fortunately until this point, it had only been my bf who had experienced this. She lunged at the dog and I wasnt strong enough to pull her back, I panicked,mind went blank, and I just stood there. In my mind, the only thing i could think was like, the idea or feeling of alarm, but I couldn't speak or move. The neighbor didn't seem to mind and gave the dogs treats, but I felt so terrible. I don't know how to fix this.

&amp;nbsp;

During the critique, my mind was blank and I didn't know what to say. I absorbed things others had said, but my mind flushed them out when I tried to speak. Speaking and thinking at the same time is difficult for me. I guess I'm just stupid. I usually think for a long time before I speak, and I can think and write, but I dont know how to think+speak quickly or at once. I just felt like crying and couldn't wait to just pack up and start on my drawing assignment(until I realized I'd forgotten my most important supplies).

&amp;nbsp;

I grew up with abusive parents. My dad was pretty absent, working a lot, but when he was home he was a complete ass. He would constantly provoke me. My older brother harshly picked on me. My mom did the most damage, somehow. I grew up thinking she was ""good cop"", she taught me to think that. She could do no wrong, she was perfect, she was always right. If she was upset with me, even if seemingly unreasonable, I did mental gymnastics with myself to justify it. Example: I didn't intervene in her argument with my dad over finances which 6 year old me didn't understand? I'm a bad person who doesn't love mom. 
Moms in the bathroom the 8th time this week with razor blades? I'd be her psychiatrist and beg her to come out,reason with her why she should. Eventually I realized I didn't have to say anything. Eventually still, I realized that I could probably leave because she would just come out soon anyway. I did once, around 6 or 7 and I guess she talked and I didn't respond, so she came literally running after me, cornered me, and yelled down at me for not loving her.
&amp;nbsp;
I have an eating disorder? 
I'm ""evil"", I'm a ""dirty slut"" even though I'm not allowed out of the house- this must be because of how I look or something I've done- am I that person? Mom says so, so i guess so. 
&amp;nbsp;
As a young child, I was mostly raised by my grandparents nextdoor and would sleep over at their house often. I'd cry myself to sleep every night because I thought my mom was mad at me. Every day, I'd be to blame for something. Once, I even got blamed for my dad losing $100. I don't even know why. My mom yelled from up at our back door to down at the yard at me, with the neighborhood kids all outside, telling me I'd better bring the $100 back right now. So then my friends assumed I was a thief(cause a 9 y/o who can't drive and never goes anywhere has a reason for money is definitely wont get caught with random money at some point 🙄). 

&amp;nbsp;

At some point, around 9, I started self harming because I didn't understand what I had apparently done. I was upset for always being such an apparent major cause of my mother's pain- the person I did love most in the world no matter what she thought.

&amp;nbsp;

My parents destroyed my education as an ongoing argument for the funsies I guess. I planned to graduate at 15 or 16 and GTFO. I was physically bullied at school to the point of having my arms near broken every day. I begged to be homeschooled- my plan was to be able to focus on my schooling without bullies and graduate early to get away from my family. I was in 2nd grade my first year homeschooling and skipped up to grade 5 work in everything but math, which I got up to maybe grade 3 which was equivalent to my current grade in public school work. My parents would argue about public and homeschooling and switch me back and forth at least once a school semester. So I'd be in public school in august for a few months, then homeschooled. Obviously this ruined my extra work I'd done and I became discouraged. In 7th grade, I began having a lot of trouble with math. My mom refused to help me, saying I had learning disability and just couldn't learn so to not do it(and then help my lovely, psychotic step sister instead). She'd do this to me at public school too, and I'd often go in humiliated having to explain that I couldn't finish my homework. 

&amp;nbsp;

At one point, I wasn't allowed outside(my grandparents had moved in) and due to that and all the stress, I embraced being reclusive. I told myself I wanted to be that way and whenever people would think it was odd, my mom would huff back at them before I could speak, saying that not everyone has to have friends.

&amp;nbsp;

And now I'm this. Looking back, I remember my dad telling me that my mom coddled me too much and kept me from other people, wanting me all to herself. At the time I thought it was ridiculous, but now I see he was right; she needed me to soothe her, to blame for everything, to be there in misery with her. 
&amp;nbsp;

I got older, decided that I wanted to try being social, so I'd say yes to every single opportunity. Every one. That was a terrible idea and I ended up being abused by a few predatory opportunists, which in turn caused me major anxiety, more than ever before, and I became more reclusive than ever before. I havent held a stable job in a while. Havent had friends since that time, about 10 years ago. I've been with my SO, who has been abusive off and on. Things were great for a few years until we moved out a few years ago, and now they've been very off and on. For a few years again, things have been pretty good as far as that goes, but obviously not having time and not feeling effort from the other person feels shitty too. 

&amp;nbsp;

A couple years ago I found myself in a terrible situation with him and decided my options were prostitution, stripping, drugs, or suicide. I mass applied to jobs but when I'd receive a response, I was never qualified for anything but retail which I've had bad experiences with and it doesn't pay enough. I stopped eating, became an alcoholic with the little funds I had, and attempted suicide somewhere near 3 times a week on average for a few months straight. I almost succeeded once and then my bf unexpectedly came home early and I was sent to the hospital. Things didn't get better when I got out, I threw away my antidepressants since my feelings felt inappropriate in relation to my thoughts and situation, and resumed weekly attempts. Otherwise I'd just lie in bed and try not to get up for fear of killing myself.

&amp;nbsp;

2017 and 2018 sucked. Last year got a little better and by the end of the year I decided to go back to school. I decided rather abruptly and didn't have time to seek diagnosis for learning disabilities, which I think I obviously have. I have a diagnosis of anxiety disorders and recurrent major depressive disorder but I've assumed I wouldn't receive any accommodations for those because.. what can be done?

&amp;nbsp;

Instead I've tried plowing through my feelings and intentionally making myself uncomfortable by joining clubs and going to campus in person, but I'm not adjusting as quickly as I'd hoped. And in the real world, I will have to talk, I will have to have social skills. No one cares about you in the real world. I'm old and have already exposed myself to that in the many job fields I've attempted, so I'm aware. 

&amp;nbsp;

I just feel like I'm a failure. And now I'm overloading myself and I dont want to back down, but idk how to deal with everything and get no help, and have nothing outside of school and working at home. I need a good balance, but I have literally no way of making that happen. I'm in a club that meets once a week, the paper which is 1x a month, and now a new club that no one showed up for, so I became club leader. This will force me into social situations, and I hope that I can do it. In my head I'm telling myself to just do it, so I try, and I talk, and garbage comes out. And I'm older than everyone else, so it's awkward. I'm not supposed to be so immature and stupid by social standards. 

&amp;nbsp;

I feel like I'm just not going to make it. I have straight A's but I feel like I don't deserve them. My art never looks good to me even after spending hours working. I need to make this work but I dont know how. I dont know how to change who I've been for 29 years, in an instant, but I desperately want to. I want to be different, I dont want to be who I am anymore. In the meantime, I'm trying to squeeze in time with my SO and getting very little sleep. Most of it is just time in the same room not even interacting or talking or anything and I feel really void of any affection and social interaction right now, as well as anything fun. I used to walk every day- it's something that lessens the frequency of nerve pain and I dont even have time for that. The weather has been shit anyway. I dont find gaming fun, I don't like to sit, but that's all I'm doing. I'm exhausted. 

&amp;nbsp;

I dont even know what I'm getting at anymore with this. I'm just frustrated with life. Everything is dull,I'm over stressed,lonely, and I honestly just hate myself. Everything about myself is awful, I really hate who I am. I became really sick in the first few weeks of school and have had bronchitis for about 3-4 weeks. It's getting better but I feel like that happening really fucked a lot up for me since I had no energy. I dont know how to manage everything or how to socialize. I feel like I should just kill myself but I dont know how to even do it properly in a way that wont be totally awful. I'm looking to get away from pain and if the last minutes of my life could at least be peaceful that would be, well, ideal.

I don’t have the balls to approach a girl or even ask a question in class. And the final blow is that I’m literally broke and have to work on the weekends to keep ~150 bucks in my account which just puts me further behind in school. 

I’m just so tired of everything. Tired of doing everything alone, having no one to talk. Tired of constant school work or shitty part-time job work. I resent my dad and dislike my step mom.

Fuck an interesting title,"So I've been scrolling down this page for a while now and I'm amazed by how much people feel the same way as I have for a while now. It doesn't make me feel any better but actually more determined to take my life knowing people live the rest of their life like this. 

I'm 16 years old I left school at 15 quit college at 16 and have no qualifications to rely on. I'm extremely socially awkward and possibly have deppresion I don't know. See the thing is I also have a extreme fear of doctors and just having people examine me in general and this has been taking more of an effect on me than normal.

Around December last year I took acid for the first time. I don't remember a lot about that night as I entered an incredibly deep bad trip after my friend was kicked out of the house leaving me alone  on my first time. As I said I can't remember a lot about that night but  2 main factors stuck with me 1. My balls felt HEAVY real heavy 2. I thought I killed myself on multiple occasions that night. I kept seeing images of a weapon infront of me each time different each time more deadly. Everyone time believing they were real I tried to use them to end my life. And it felt like I would wake up everytime alive and I would cry. 

Reading back on this probably should have mentioned before I was already suicidal as shit before taking oh well.

Anyway couple months progress I'm doing ok and I'm lying in bed smoking a joint when that sane feeling of heaviness occurred in my balls not as strong this time but still there. After a couple weeks of consistent around night time feelings of heaviness occurred I decided to Google (yeah ik) my issue.

To my absolute fucking horror I discovered I have something called a vardicole or something like that I don't want to go back and check as I'm extremely 0aranoid of reading something I don't want to.

Now before anything gets typed I want to say that it is 100 percent that condition (whatever the name may be) as the symptoms aren't exactly common among other conditions. 

As I said in extremely scared of hospitals and getting examined so something around that area has an extreme effect on me even thinking about getting it checked.

I've been doing good for a while now but I can't get the thoughts out of my head and I can feel myself spiralling until those final moments where I can find eternal peace. 

So this is what I ask of you reading this if you would help me. I'm terrified of searching what will happen to me if I don't get surgery but I also kind of want to know so I'm basing this heavily on trust if you were to do a tiny bit of research on the condition and only leave a positive comment ABSOLUTELY NOTHING NEGATIVE ABOUT CONDITION PLEASE. Like if it will damage me do not tell me even if it can kill please don't tell me. But if you find anything that will be reassuring please let me know. Because I'm not getting surgery so please please don't tell me anything bad about it I am genuinely terrified to post this in case people just say shit anyway

"In the best way I could, I tried. But it didn't work","Last night was hard. Harder than the rest. I won't lie, all my feelings of death were enhanced when I saw that my e×, my first and only love, have the time of his life with someone else. I was drunk and sure I wanted to die. So I told a friend and she was sad, but I reassured her I wasnt going to do anything. When I went home to my apartment, I took a handful of ibuprofen pills and went to sleep. I probably should have taken more because I'm awake typing this. I know it's stupid to think I could overdose on ibuprofen, but I didn't have anything else. I'm so disappointed that I woke up this morning and saw a text from me ex, essentially saying that he has been over me for almost a year and that he was happy now and he was over it. Him telling me to get over it. The reason I want to die isn't because of him. However, knowing that whatever feelings I felt of love were unrequited, just makes me wish I wasn't alive to see it. I wish it was my last message. I wish it worked somehow. I'm just so tired of living my life, but there's no real way to end it. I'm trapped.

Eternal Rest,"I’m a 13 year old boy, and I don’t want to be one of those self diagnosing people only looking for attention. Lately all I can think about killing myself or just saying fuck everything in life. Hate to say it but if I had a gun right now I think I would kill myself. It’s fast and easy, no pain unlike waiting for you to bleed out from your slit wrists. No one ever likes me. My parents always talk about what a useless piece of shit I am and brags to their friends about it like it’s an accomplishment. “You know that he didn’t even do this and this, etc. He’s such a fucking asshole he doesn’t do anything right. I wish I never had kids, I wanted a girl!”, they would say usually weekly. That shit hurts. I’ve been rejected by everyone. I’ve always had straight A’s, been the smartest and mostly progressive person in the class. I’m tired of putting on a facade that anything is worth anything. There is no heaven or hell, just nothing. So why not end it? No one’s listened to my problems. “Man up, boys don’t cry! Women run the world, all men are pigs and need to die”, is what I’m constantly told. I just don’t know anymore, I just stopped caring. All I do is listen to music and cry. School is useless, learning absolutely fucking nothing and wasting your life away for a degree you can’t use. I’m sure everyone is gonna say, I’m so young, I can’t have depression. Of course not, he’s just going through a phase and is seeking attention. But that’s alright. Always been introverted and quiet. So, I just don’t know. I think I should kill myself soon life has no purpose nor meaning, just an eternal land of misery and fake happiness. The only thing that makes me remotely happy is video games and talking to people on them, but playing games is a rare occurrence. Never allowed to play though I excel every way in school, so fuck it. Drop everything who gives a shit about grades. Who gives a shit about anything. So... I’m done here.

"He took my childhood, but I’m taking my life","I was scared he was going to do what he did to me to another little girl, and so I finally reported my abuse to the police nearly 6 years after it had ended. There was no physical evidence and so to press charges they need me to testify in court. 

I’m going to testify, but then I’m going to kill myself. Regardless of the verdict, I will have made my disgusting and horrible actions known to the public so history cannot repeat itself, and little girls will be safe from the predator who stole so much from me. It’s just so much easier to guarantee that my suffering will end than to expect a court to do right thing.

In all honestly, I never imagined living this long, I never thought I’d make it to my senior year of high school. I’m supposed to go to college in the fall, but I’ll be dead by then.

I haven’t made a post in about a year,"I’m 19 now, Im surprised I made it this far. But around Halloween I cut my wrist, with a big scare to show for it. I moved out my parents house, which I thought would make things better, but it really didn’t. I’m still suffering greatly. I feel I can’t even put it into words the emptiness and great suffocation I feel to be alive everyday. Im in community college but I barely go. I work a part time job but I only get one day a week. It’s all so overwhelming. I wanted to be an artist but I can’t even make art anymore, everything feels like such a burden and such a chore in my life. I feel like people don’t care about me at all. I understand they have their own lives, but I feel no one takes what I say seriously. Especially the people I live with, my sister and her wife. They say “we care about you and we understand what you’re feeling but it comes to a point where you have to do things.” Like I understand that, I’m trying, but I just can’t. I’m useless, horrible, and incompetent. 

As a kid, I never really felt happy either. I was always left alone, hated, and ignored. As a kid I was sexually abused for about 2 years by an older girl then 2 random occasions by 2 boys. I’ve suffered from my trauma that didn’t come to surface until I was 16. So I’ve just been dealing with that for a while and I can’t seem to overcome it. I’ve tried a couple medications but they don’t really seem to work. Killing myself seems to be only way to end my pain. I can’t function as a human. I just get so tired, mentally and physically.  I always hope for things to get better but they never do. Im just a fat sack of shit who won’t accomplish anything in their life. I feel I can’t say anything how I truly feel.

Pragmatic suicide,"This might sound ridiculous, but I want to die, and I'm not severely depressed. I'm approaching this purely philosophically.

The way I see it, my life is more suffering than joy, and that's probably not going to change. In fact, I would say this is true of most people. We spend most of our time doing things we don't want to do: working, cleaning, driving in traffic, feeling hungry, experiencing physical discomfort, etc, etc. Why would it not be better to not exist at all (I don't believe in an afterlife) rather than experience the totality of consciousness?

Now other people will mourn my death, this much is true. But they're going to mourn my death regardless of when it happens. No mourning is avoided by making it happen now. If anything, I'm at a point in my life when no one is dependent on me and my death will have the smallest impact it probably ever will.

I'm not sure were else to turn,"I have nothing but negative thoughts all the time, I can remember when it started but it has gotten so bad I tend to cry myself to sleep if I even can sleep. I don't know who to talk to and don't really have anyone to talk to so I just want to dump everything here and maybe get some guidance before I do something to make the pain go away. I never see my parents due to my mom and step dad being too busy with work and running a business and my dad is probably somewhere rotting in Arizona. My sister is deployed in the navy and the other ran away a few years ago and haven't heard from her, and my older brother is a drug addict that cut ties with us a long time ago. 

I don't want to message a suicide hotline out of fear they will send an ambulance or force me into a hospital forcing bills on me that I can not afford, and I have no one close to talk to about it. My situation is, growing up my parents both lived in different bad areas with little money. I was never smart or talented at anything besides having an over active imagination. I always had a learning issue both with paying attention and remembering information regardless of how hard I tried. Didn't have a lot of friends and ended up dropping out of high school. About 3 years ago I went back and got my Adult Diploma with the hopes it would be enough to get me on my feet. I'm now almost 26 and just a few months ago after I saw someone about my mental health I found out I have ADD. So some things where answered there, but it didn't help much. 

The small amount of friends that I have, have become aware of my increasing depressed emotions and have tried to help but for the most part, they seem to pay no mind to it. I've working dead end jobs for most of my adult life until recently when I took a boot camp course in the Information Technology field. I then interned for 5 weeks and after got a position working for a small company as an IT help desk technician under a 3 month to perm contract. Or that's what they told me during the interview. I never did anything IT related and the contract was constantly extend by 3 months until my 9th month there. In that time, I've worked for some bad companies, but I have never worked somewhere that treated there (specifically the US employees) so poorly. They then after promising to increase my pay hired me on full time as salary, and cut my pay thinking I wouldn't notice. I then secretly started looking for new positions starting last July until November of last year when I was tired of they way they have treated me for over a year and without thinking, just left, even though I have monthly bills. 

On top of the learning problems, I also have extreme anger problems and am very VERY impatient. As far as work goes, I have applied to countless IT positions since last July, with professional help updating resumes and cover letters, and re learning (trying to) as much IT knowledge as I can after using pretty much none of it at my last job and forgetting almost all of it, but I've gotten nothing. I have had 2 companies interview me and reject me after the 2nd or 3rd interview, and all of the other countless companies I've applied to have either flat out rejected me or have not said anything. I have next to nothing left with money and if I don't find something soon, I will lose everything and I can only imagine how bad my credit will be and the law suits to follow. Other than job things, I have never been in a real relationship, I never see my family even though I literally live with my mom and step dad, I almost never see my friends, I have an extreme hate for people I'm assuming due to everything I've had to go through over the years, and every day I spend hours trying to teach myself new things and applying for any position available that could possible help me with my situation, but since the last interview rejection and the constant no reply and email rejections, I can't anymore. 

I've tried so hard to make things better for myself, seeking medical help, close support from family and friends, and will power, but it's always one step forward and then being launched back. I'm tired of starting over, I'm tired of only knowing rejection and being ignored not just from jobs but from everything. I have become so angry and hate filled that I can't see happiness in anything. I used to love movies and video games and can't find joy in those. The only piece of escape I have day to day is music, because it almost thinks for me. I'm listening to it but I feel like it's also listening to me, feeling my constant pain and emotional wreck. Everyone says it will get better, but I've been at this for so long and it only keeps getting worse. I have put the effort in but it's like some deity is purposefully trying to prevent me from being happy or making myself successful, and over the past few weeks, I can't stop thinking of killing myself. Making this awful pain go away and not feeling anything anymore. The only thing that holds me back is the thought of what comes after. Possible non existence which I can't even comprehend. Just not knowing is the only thing holding me back, but even that fear is starting to go away and taking an early exit seems more and more like the best option.

I apologize for the extremely long post, maybe just a way to leave a small mark on existence to make myself feel a little better. I don't seem myself feeling any better even if my hard work eventually gets me anywhere, a family, a job that actually pays enough for me to live on my own, not constantly worrying if I have enough for food and water or if I have to cut that out to make my payments.

Fuck you for remembering the physical and emotional abuse your dad did to you and your family.

Fuck you for letting your mom run her little experiments on your body like some sort of lab rat.

Fuck you for speaking out about your suffering when you did. Going to the adults really improved your life and didn't just make your abusers hate you more while they got off with slaps on the wrist, huh?

Fuck you for remembering your childhood, especially only the bad parts. I'm 25 now and am just now experiencing these again, and you have no idea what sort of hell I'm in getting these vague memories again and again. This is YOUR FAULT!

I want you dead like how I want me dead. I want you to suffer way more than you ever had before just so you won't survive and I don't have to experience it anymore.

Personal count down to my suicide. My plan.,"I am a caucasian male , age 30. I wont get into complete vivid details of the numerous conditions i have ( childhood exc ) , this started happening when i was around 27. An ex and i whom spent well over 10 years together had broken up due to her unfaithfulness exc. Something happened and although i have spoken to many people and therapists. I feel like the real me is dead. And i am a walking multiple personality basket case , im always being someone im not , no freinds , all that which i had motivation for and excitement for is nothing. I am an empty shell. We got back together and she informed me that she was pregnant by a fling , which was planned , please note that we tried for kids for 6 years prior and she was found out to be infertile unless on fertility meds , long story short she aborted that child and got pregnant with me. Given that the situation prior was hard enough , the trauma and pure gut wrenching pain of questioning the pregnancy as well as my family questioning took its tole , work deterriorated and personal happyness was destroyed.

I dont know why , but i feel that its the logical thing to do. Given my situations. Im always being someone im not , multiple people. I make rash decisions that have and ruined my life. I have always wanted to be a police officer and thats thrown out due to tatoo policys , people have always avoided me because im either creepy or just weird. My family has abandonned me legit.

I come from a long line of dead people.,"I know everyone technically does.

I’m trans, gay, a person of color, mentally ill, and I feel like I’m living on borrowed time. My body and head keeps fighting against me as things get externally better, comparatively. I’ve been having blood problems - or maybe just extra health anxiety, I genuinely do not know. Healthcare for trans people is shit. I haven’t had an official doctor, just rotating nurse practitioners from clinics.

When I came out to my grandparents, my grandma said it ran on my mom’s side of the family. Her words were that there “was another [transgender], but he’s dead now”. I don’t know who that is. But he’s dead. And I keep feeling called to be. I get why so many trans activists kill themselves. 

I want to make the world a better place. I do. But I don’t know if I’m cut out for it. I’m getting worse at taking care of myself and school? Don’t even get me started. I’ve been failing consistently since my last year of high school. I’m currently failing what’s supposed to be my second to last semester of college. Everyone thinks I’m lazy, but I can feel the physical block. My therapist says it’s almost definitely related to my cPTSD. But I don’t know what to do. She doesn’t know either.

Maybe I’m whining. I’m first-generation in my country. My mom moved here from a third world country with practically nothing. But I do feel like my body was not meant for this. If it’s because I’m weak, I’m not surprised.

I've been planning my end for years now.,"I always liked beauty. Probably the only thing that kept me from ending it all. But even it wasn't enough, isn't, most of the time. 
Sometimes the only thing that calms me is to plan how I'm going to do it. It came to a point that every time that I'm suicidal again the only thing stopping me is the complexity of the scene. I still don't have the right things, I can't go to the place, my hair isn't in the right length and etc. 
I never told anyone about it. I'm living between numbness and intense feelings that hurt too much. I feel like I'm wasting my privileges, I'm wasting my capacities, I don't want to, I don't know what to do. The best phases are when I'm hyper, but I get destructive and it's not ideal. 
I miss xanax but I'm tired of numbing it down. I'm tired of living like a nun, I'm tired of always having to control myself so much when I feel something.

Laying it out all there,"Hey everyone,

This is so weird that a Reddit board exists for this, but hey it does. I'm a 31 year old, who generally has a lot going for him on paper (good job, partner, lots of friends, supportive family, health, etc). With the job, there is one caveat, I don't know what I'm doing. For context purposes, I'm an accountant and have been one for almost a decade now. I was the kid who studied his butt off in school with the expectation that would pay off in the form of a good job, success etc. I was also one of those people that thought he was better than others, where deep down I wasn't. Really, everybody is special and unique in their own ways. Anyways, what I'm getting at is I feel I've put a lot of bad energy out there and it's all culminating into one big disaster over the past few months. That disaster being the realization that the skills that I say I have on paper I don't actually have in real life (somehow miraculously I got by the past 10 years) and now I don't know what to do. Over the past few months I haven't been sleeping, barely getting anything done at work and overall feel like the end is near. I've had suicide ideation since I was a 15 coupled with worrying about death in general. Anyways, not sure what I expect to get out of posting this, but just wanted to share my situation.

"A kink in my suicide plan, not sure what to do","I'm a useless freeloader who's never, not for a single second, done or said anything of use. A few years ago my parents were sorting out stuff to do with life insurance and, even though I never asked, I kinda just assumed I had life insurance. My suicide plan was to, obviously, off myself (but not make it look like suicide) then have my parents collect on my insurance and donate my body to science. No funeral costs, huge sum of money, and a freeloader off their back for good.

I don't actually know if the plan would work, I haven't researched it much obvs 

Except now I know it definitely won't work because I just learned that I don't have life insurance... and I'm sure it would look hella suspicious if I had a policy taken out on me only to die a few days later...

I need to know,"For a few years now i’ve been having these 4-5 month periods of just malaise and insecurity. I feel so selfish writing this. My parents refuse to get me tested for depression, So i can’t say that I have it. I am ugly. No one wants to talk to me because i’m not cool enough. If they are seen with me theyre automatically labeled as un-cool. I hate everyone. theyre so fucking selfish and fake. To me it hurts more to be rejected by a potential friend than a potential girlfriend. The only friends I have see that i’m sad or im not motivated, and they try and force me to open up, and when they finally force me to they try to become my therapist. Then I become a burden to them and they feel the need to check up on me. And then they use my problems against me if I make them mad. I am so fucking selfish and everyone lies to me. Recently one of my only friends, a girl, i fell in love with, backstabbed me. She had been for many months now. I confessed my love for her 7 months ago and we’ve been “more than friends” for a while.. I realized that she only did this because she felt bad for me. She leaked my affectionate love notes and my personal problems to my only friends, who then laughed at me, called me a simp and stopped talking to me. I’m too affectionate with people. My past relationships have always failed because i’m not a strong independent man. I’m a needy baby when it comes to the relationship and no girl wants a needy baby let alone an ugly fuck like me. I see girls at my school who look exactly like the girl who backstabbed me and it fucking eats me away inside knowing I have no chance. I want out. I just want to press escape and quit. I’m too scared to jump off a building and I only would feel comfortable with a gun. But I don’t know if this is for real or just angst..?

Feeling stuck living with manipulative parents,"I’m having doubts about wanting to keep going. I just turned 25, I’m a girl from the US who is disabled (I have depression, BPD, anxiety, ADD and I have bad tremors as a result of these issues) and my parents treat me like I’m a little girl. I have not worked a proper job very much in my life and I’m a little immature for my age. 

Basically, where I am now, I feel mentally and physically unwell to work - the tremors go in and out and I collapse of exhaustion at least twice a month from them. My parents, my mum especially- are pressuring me to work, she gives me jobs I know I wouldn’t be able to handle and I apply to them to make her happy, though I never hear back. She is a social worker and when I say I’m too unwell to work she goes *”I’ve worked with people with Down’s syndrome, who were severely disabled, they had jobs.”* or *”I worked with a schizophrenic woman once, that’s worse than what you have, and she held down a 9 to 5 job.”* and so fourth. I think I should be on disability but my mum sees that as “giving up” and says that they won’t accept me because I “haven’t showed signs of trying” IE my small work history - the majority of money I’ve made over the years is from my music, but that comes few and far between.
Because I don’t have a job, my mum makes it my “job” in the house to be the only person who ever cleans our cats’ litter box, and when my tremors are going this is bad because I can’t hold the bag straight and I get litter and cat droppings everywhere, but she’s so insistent on sticking it to me that I’m not working that this doesn’t matter. 
I Have two girlfriends, my parents only know I’m dating one of them. One lives in Canada, I have wanted to run away there but my mum said if I even tried to visit her she would get Canadian police to come get me since I’m mentally unwell (my Canadian girlfriend also struggles with that and my parents like her but says she’s a “basket case” and that I shouldn’t  date her) but I  kinda don’t have a passport anyway.

My other girlfriend lives in the Midwest US and my mum says if I moved there I’d never contact the family ever again even though I told her I would, and that I would become ungrateful towards my girlfriend and get an “attitude” with her - my parents say I have a short temper but I’m quite mellow, it’s just that years of verbal abuse from my father - who to his credit is finally doing something about this - has gotten me very damaged.


Anyways, I like tried to stab myself in the stomach but was stopped and the knife was taken from me. I feel  stuck, and I really want to keep going but it’s getting really difficult. I don’t want to break my girlfriends’ hearts. I don’t know what to do anymore. I don’t know if I’m just unstable or if my parents are really mistreating me.",Dr_Deirdre_Airlines,2,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/fddtuk/feeling_stuck_living_with_manipulative_parents/,doubt wanting keep going turned 25 girl u disabled depression bpd anxiety add bad tremor result issue parent treat like little girl worked proper job much life little immature age basically feel mentally physically unwell work tremor go collapse exhaustion least twice month parent mum especially pressuring work give job know able handle apply make happy though never hear back social worker say unwell work go worked people syndrome severely disabled job worked schizophrenic woman worse held 9 5 job fourth think disability mum see giving say accept showed sign trying ie small work history majority money made year music come far job mum make job house person ever clean cat litter box tremor going bad hold bag straight get litter cat droppings everywhere insistent sticking working matter two girlfriend parent know dating one one life canada wanted run away mum said even tried visit would get canadian police come get since mentally unwell canadian girlfriend also struggle parent like say basket case date kinda passport anyway girlfriend life midwest u mum say moved never contact family ever even though told would would become ungrateful towards girlfriend get attitude parent say short temper quite mellow year verbal abuse father credit finally something ha gotten damaged anyways like tried stab stomach wa stopped knife wa taken feel stuck really want keep going getting really difficult want break girlfriend heart know anymore know unstable parent really mistreating,feeling stuck living manipulative parent,dr deir dre airline

I won't be turning 26 this year,"For the record, I'm not trying to feel sorry for myself or try to gather sympathy but I'm done. All my life I've let people walk all over, I've always put everyone else before myself, and I've gone above beyond for people. I don't know why people don't like me or be around me. I have gone to therapy for years to better myself and always tried to be the best person I can but it didn't work. 

I hate myself so much. I am a burden to my parents, very few people care about me and I am a waste of space to be alive.   I know my parents will be upset but they will get over it quickly because they have my brother who is extremely intelligent, handsome and very well-liked.  My dad will for sure be okay because he had two kids from a previous marriage and one's a doctor about to get engaged and the other owns her marketing agency and is married to a great guy with two beautiful children. I come from a family of overachievers and I have never measured no matter how hard I tried. They are also very attractive people and for some reason, I came out looking so deformed and ugly.  I just feel like there is no point in trying anymore. I screw up all the time, I am a huge loser and very few people like me. It's better  I do this now than waste another 25 years alone.

life after suicide attempt just feels weird,"I’m in my last year of compulsory school. I tried to kill myself by taking an overdose of prescription pain medication. But I failed miserably. I thought that life would return to normal but everything is fucked up. 

Everyone is acting weird around me, home is uncomfortable, I’ve been labelled as a ‘vulnerable student’, I use to have free periods which I used to spend hanging with my friends or chilling in empty classrooms - they’ve all been taken away and I’ve now been timetabled in for compulsory ‘supervised studies’ EVERYDAY, I’m not allowed to leave school during break or lunches because they need to make sure I’m ‘safe’. It’s so fucking embarrassing. 

My school is telling all my teachers that I’m ‘vulnerable’ that I shouldn’t be asked questions during lesson, and should be allowed to take ‘breaks’. My social worker came to visit today. My parents told my younger sister about my attempt without my fucking knowledge. CAMHS booked me in for an appointment despite me turning 18 in 2 months. 

Everyone just acts fucking weird around me. 

My parents who are both narcs all of a sudden want to start being caring and started telling everyone who asked the reason I attempted suicide was because I got rejected from my top university choice - it really and truly was NOT the reason I felt like I needed to die. 

I tried telling one of my friends about my attempt, and I mentioned in passing that I had my stomach pumped. She started asking me what it feels like and whether or not they replace the substance removed from your stomach like it was fucking cool or something. It was just insensitive. 

I can’t bare the awkwardness. I just feel very trapped and everything just feels so strange. I don’t know what to do and everything just feels so fucked up. I don’t want any special treatment. I just want life to return to the way it was.",glenkarma,8,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/fdgi0b/life_after_suicide_attempt_just_feels_weird/,last year compulsory school tried kill taking overdose prescription pain medication failed miserably thought life would return normal everything fucked everyone acting weird around home uncomfortable labelled vulnerable student use free period used spend hanging friend chilling empty classroom taken away timetabled compulsory supervised study everyday allowed leave school break lunch need make sure safe fucking embarrassing school telling teacher vulnerable asked question lesson allowed take break social worker came visit today parent told younger sister attempt without fucking knowledge camhs booked appointment despite turning 18 2 month everyone act fucking weird around parent narc sudden want start caring started telling everyone asked reason attempted suicide wa got rejected top university choice really truly wa reason felt like needed die tried telling one friend attempt mentioned passing stomach pumped started asking feel like whether replace substance removed stomach like wa fucking cool something wa insensitive bare awkwardness feel trapped everything feel strange know everything feel fucked want special treatment want life return way wa,life suicide attempt feel weird,glen karma
Feel guilty for wanting to die.,"I have a beautiful wife and 2 year old son. A great job. Had a good childhood. But I’ve been dealing with depression for years. I’m extremely unhappy. I find it exhausting having to interact with people. I hate basically everything about myself and even more so because on paper I have no reason to be unhappy. I’m tired. I think about killing myself a lot but feel extremely guilty about leaving my wife and child. I had a bit of a breakdown last year and told my wife I wanted to die and now she is constantly worried about me. I can see how stressful it is for her. If I don’t answer my phone for an extended period of time she says she gets physically sick thinking I’ve done it. I don’t think I ever will but I’m also just so fucking tired. Past couple weeks have been pretty bad. Again no reason to feel this way. Just overwhelmingly sad and unhappy.

I feel guilty because I know I’d worry everyone because of course they don’t want me to die, if they care about me or not they don’t want somebody to kill themselves regardless.

I want to die and don't see a way forward,"I've been in a funk for a long time and it's just not getting any better. I'm really struggling with literally everything right now. My family is no help. I lost one of my jobs because the place closed and so I'm having to burn through my savings to cover everything. Last month, I was struggling with coming up with my rent money and my prescriptions. This month I've got the rent covered but now don't have enough money for the power bill, my car payment, and my car insurance ad again I'm left panicking and stressing about where I'm going to get the money and what's going to happen. I'm starting a new job in three weeks but that doesn't help me right now. It's so depressing and I honestly feel like killing myself sometimes over it. I wake up dreading what the day holds and it's horrible. My parents don't believe me when I tell them I'm depressed and won't help me with money because they think I should learn through struggling. Everything with them just adds to my state of mind.

My boyfriend tried to kill himself and I don’t know if I should stay with him,"My boyfriend and I have been in a long distance relationship since about five months now. We’ve known each other for much longer but just as uni started we realised that we wanted to date each other. Just recently, his close cousin died in a car crash. His father who passed away when he was about 14 also died in a car crash. Yesterday, I found out from his sister that he was in the hospital due to a car accident. Now presuming how much I knew that this accident affected him, I believe that he purposely did it. He kept telling me how he was going to do something stupid and how everything felt crazy on the inside and I kept telling him that I loved him and that I needed him. His sister and family will hardly reply to me when I asked what’s going on and I don’t know even know what situation he’s in - dead, alive, coma?? It’s eating me up inside and I don’t know what to do about it. It seems like the best option is to just wait but that’s too agonising for me. Should I try to get over him or wait till I know what’s happened to him? I love him a lot but I’m unsure if he would be the same person after this and if we have an opportunity to live life together anymore. He’s disappeared at times before and it’s been every stressful for me- I break down constantly and don’t eat until I’m starving. I know it sounds like our relationship is unhealthy but he has been nothing but perfect and loving and caring - I believed until recent that I was ready to spend my whole life with him. However, I can hardly help or contact him in situations like this and I feel like I’m wasting my uni life running after someone that I’m not sure I even know anymore. Despite that I know breaking up with him will hurt a lot because I thought that I was in it for the long run.

I want to die even tho it feels like i have been dead for years.,"Hello everyone i just want to tell u about my depression , loneliness, and general feeling of wanting to end this life for good. I dont even know why im doing this, idk what im looking for by posting. So... im very ashamed of my problems to the point where i feel ashamed writing this to the strangers that i wont ever see in my life... Since like 15 years ago my problem has been bad breath... and i really mean bad... cant erase it even directly after i brushed my teeth ... i have been trying to heal this sickness for a long time now with little success. Been to many doctors (free health care) i dont live in the US. Obviously im unemployed and cant afford to pay for the doctor, i stopped trying to go to the doctors after one of the doctor just laughed at me and my sickness... not literally but i could just feel how he didnt care at all and gave me a vibe of 'its not a sickness go home' So imagine me struggling to even talk openly to the doctor about it and receiving the 'ur nuts not sick' threatment from him. Im sure for people that dont have this problem its hard to understand why is it so hard for me? Let me put it like that , how would u feel if u stepped in a shit and couldnt wipe it off?Would u be comfortable walking around? standing next to someone? talking to someone? Obviously i dont even need to talk for someone to smell it, breathing thru nose is like same result, i got anxiety just by standing to someone, going to the shop is like climbing mount everest for me.

"Voyage, Voyage!","Yesterdays brawl is enough for me. Just another reason to do it, and to be honest main reason of all the bad things happening, it's better to be abandoned, rather than have a ""family"" like that, if you can even call 1 parent that hates you, and blames for everything, a ""family"". 

I must admit, it felt good to say what I said, and do what I did. It feels so good to know it's soon to be over, I fear death, and pain, but the peace that comes afterwards is what I have been waiting all my life, honest smile. 

It's moments like that, that we are waiting for, a spark that lights the shit up, and helps it explode.

Letter,"I have spent the past three days typing up a suicide letter, and as I near the end of it I find myself growing anxiety riddled and realizing how many people care enough about me in life that I felt the need to give an explanation to personally. 

So then I went back through and added a section for if I didn’t die by suicide, because part of me just doesn’t want to go through with it anymore after writing it, which I am pretty sure isn’t the point of a suicide letter but I care about them so much that I don’t want to imagine their faces when they read it. 

Everything has just been so hard recently, and I’m really tired both physically and emotionally. I am tired of all the losses, I am tired of classes, I am tired of the way some of my relationships are headed... I just want to rest and stop feeling so overwhelmed. I want to be there for my friends who are also struggling, one in particular who has been there for me more then anyone in my entire life and is potentially going through a similar problem as my own, but they haven’t been answering my text messages and I can only assume it’s because they don’t want to bother me. Now that I think about it, I never want to bother them either, which is why I bottle everything up. I wish society didn’t teach us that there are such things as “negative” emotions that need to be locked away from other people’s views. If we could all be honest with each other without feeling it’s a burden on those we love I wonder how many lives could be saved and how many deep conversations could be had with our loved ones. 

I just feel bad because if anything I just feel like I’m in the way of everyone else’s progress and just adding another problem on their mountain of problems.

I probably wont make it to my 20s,"I'm a teenage boy, soon 18 years old and I am not doing well at all.

Most tragic thing that keeps bothering me on daily basis is that few months ago me and my exgirlfiend were still in a happy relationship. I saw myself sharing a future with her. I might have committed too much in the relationship, because it was something I always relied on. We had this weird phase of not talking much before breaking up. She constantly said she was busy with school work, family and hobbies. I believed her. She is a very work active person. One day, about few weeks ago she called me and said she thinks she is gay. I was heartbroken obviously. I still am. She has been seeing this girl a lot too. I cant stop thinking about the ''what ifs''.  What if she was secretly cheating on me? What if she never even loved me? What if she dated me out of pity for 2 whole years? I can barely sleep at night thinking about this.

Not only am I going through a rough heartbreak, I am also struggling with quite severe loneliness. It is hard for me to admit, because I enjoy being alone, but it does make sense that I am seriously lonely. Few months ago I stopped going to school and after consulting with teachers we decided that it is the best for me to do school work from home. I never leave the house to go see friends. Hell I don't even think they want to see me. I am pretty sure if I just ended my life not many people would even remember me. My online friends cant even play video games with me, which would mean a lot if I could for once just do something fun with other people.

I am currently seeing a therapist. She has seen me at my worst. I never told her I was suicidal, but I'm sure she might know that already. My only solutions I can think of to get out of this hell is medication and waiting for some kind of a miracle to happen. If that doesn't work I really cannot see myself making it to my 20s or 30s. It sucks because I do want to live, but living with depression, loneliness, anxiety, heartbreak and all that kind of bs doesn't sounds worth it to me. I am going to end up being even more lonely soon once I move out. In a way that is good, because once I end it all even less people will be sad over it.

"Joining the sub, since I probably have no reason left to live","For context, I’m 19, in my first year of college, and for one month - since I failed one of my exams - I lost everything I thought I had. All my friends, my crush, and for a week now, my Dad, who just wants to be upset at me forever for not helping him to the end with carrying some construction material.

For one month, I’ve entered a downward spiral, amplified by events such as the rejection mentioned earlier, or not being able to give the license exam two days ago because of some stupid policemen who told me that I “didn’t pay the license tax” correctly. And not being able to make up with my Dad, who just hates me.

The final straw came an hour ago, when I got laughed at when I entered the classroom. Just because I happened to enter at the same time as some other older students who didn’t belong there.
When I left the college, no one noticed.

It is probably a matter of weeks or even days before I take my life. Nothing is worth it. Nothing makes me happy. Nothing can save me now. Nothing. And what’s more, no one (apart from probably my mother and sister) won’t miss me. But let’s be serious, they’ll live without me. And also, I’m sure no one will notice this post, in the heap of posts of people with more serious life issues. 

This is really what makes me a failure: not being able to live happily in a life which would seem ok to most people here.

I'm drinking myself to death and it is causing my family to be upset,"The reason I drink is to self medicate because I saw my friend pass away in a car accident when I was 19. We were both stupid and I challenged him to a race using our parents cars. Basically, he understeered into a tree. I have tried therapy but it didn't work for me. I was also diagnosed with PTSD and depression. I stopped taking my prescription because it didn't work for me. I feel that I have blood on my hands because I was the one who made him do it. 

My parents and grandfather came to me and told me that they were worried about my drinking problem. I sometimes drink a bottle of Vodka a day. I just want to drink myself to death because I'm too scared of killing myself. My granddad tried to relate to the situation by telling me about the things he was in Vietnam. I walked out because I was upset about everything. I now think that I was out of order and I would do anything to apologise.

Everything's been so hard after the psych ward.,"Throwaway, because all my friends and such know my account. I know they care, and that's what hurts me the most.

My head has always been a conflicting cloud of thoughts.

I keep thinking if I were to die, maybe everybody would be happier. Maybe I'll stop being such a fuck up. Maybe everybody would think of me as this better version of myself after I'm gone.

I'm young, and I know there's so much ahead for me, that maybe one day things will get better. But it's been so incredibly hard, and I don't think I can do it anymore. My stay at the psych ward made me behind in school, it made me feel selfish for wanting to work on myself, that I was causing pain for others.

I sometimes think that maybe if I was gone, people wouldn't need to worry anymore.

I wouldn't need to go chat to certain people to feel better.

I wouldn't stay in bed and cry all day about how much I just want to disappear.

I've been thinking about hanging myself, but after reading about how much it gets fucked up, I'm starting to think of a different method.

I don't know.

I'm just so tired.,"It's 4 am for me. Stuck alone in my room with my thoughts and I don't know why I'm even posting about any of this but I just have no one to turn too.

A little background information about me to help paint a picture. I'm 21 and gay and I am depressed, alone, filled with anxiety, and extremely suicidal. There really hasn't been a day that has gone by where I don't think about killing myself, negative thoughts about myself, just bursting into tears alone in my room or just in public.

The pain that I am feeling is completely unbearable, I'm just so tired of even living and moving forward in this life when I just don't think worth it. My whole life I just have been faced with pain and pain and pain again and I just keep trying and I'm just so tired. I'm tired of this life. Tired of the pain and just tired with myself.

I have come to the realization that no matter what I do, no matter how hard I try, or how hard I try to become someone else. I just will never be good enough, that has always been what my life has been about. I don't even know who I am anymore, I look in the mirror and I just don't recognize who I am anymore let alone know who I am anymore. Sounds weird, I know. It's just I was never happy with who I was as a person and that always fucked me up then I try being other people and that always fucked me up so I just never win. It's just so fucking disheartening and gruesome to just always be put back in this hellish place of just never being enough, uglyness, trying so hard and getting fucked and this whole stupid ass existence.

I just don't see a future anymore. I don't want to see tomorrow anymore. I'm constantly wishing for death. Hoping I get run over by a car, get in an accident, OD on anything. Just something that will take this pain away.

I have been feeling this way for years and years and I just never seem to get a break, not even for a single moment. I am always brought back here. This is all I never know. I don't deserve love or happiness or even a glimpse of joy. I'm always there for others and I try my best to be supportive to show my love and care but when it come's to me I just don't get it.

I'm ready to go. I say that every day and yet I'm still here.... I don't know why that is though. But at the same time I just feel like i'm one step closer to pushing the trigger and ending it all. Sorry for my foolishness. I probably will delete. But hey if I ever end up doing it, my thoughts will be here.

Please remember this,"Okay, let me tell you something. This is not out of the blue or anything. This is from my experience as well others.
When someone attempts suicide or seems to show suicidal traits, you are not supposed to hit them with aggressive sentences like ""Are you crazy? What the fuck is wrong with you?"" and insensitive sentences like ""Maybe, try this, it will help you die easily"" or ""Suicide is for the cowards"".
For a moment, take a step back and stand in their shoes. Try to understand, why they took such a big step. Ask questions like ""Are you feeling fine?"" ""Are you okay?"" ""Do you wanna talk about it?"" and ""I'm always here"".
That's the sign of an emotionally mature person who knows what to say when.
Do not also try to justify their actions by comparing your pain to theirs. Their journey, their struggles, their hurt are absolutely different from yours. Their tolerance level is different. You're not doing any good by constantly showering comparisons in disguise of advices.

I hate encouragement,"(Disclaimer that I get suicidal ideation in a more ongoing ""casual"" form, so might not resonate with everyone.)

What I would give for someone to say, ""I understand you're struggling, and I will understand if you choose to end it.""

Even my friends who get suicidal ideation come from a perspective of it being something you'll get through. They talk about how meds have helped them. Or about how they've become more resilient. And they'll say they'll help and encourage you the whole way.

But I don't want someone to encourage me. I want someone to sit with me and say, ""Yeah that really sucks."" To say, ""It's okay if you can't handle it."" Or even, ""I'll help you end the pain.""

I wouldn't do anything, would never take them up on it. But it would be so incredibly validating. 

I want to be heard; I want to be understood. I'm on meds, I'm in therapy, I'm resilient. I know I'm doing all the right things.

I don't know what to do.,"I'm 28m, I moved back in with my parents when my house was sold out from under me.  I've been slowly deteriorating.  I've considered suicide since I was in middleschool.  And attempted sometimes halfheartedly, a handful of times.

&amp;#x200B;

I feel empty.  Like I don't belong.  I have been single for the last 6 years.  Not counting short relationships.  I haven't gone to college.  I have no desire to continue living.

&amp;#x200B;

When I was younger suicide was a strong but fleeting feeling.  It would hit me like a train but if I held on for long enough it would disappear like a light being switched off.  As I grow older it seems that those feelings that before were quick, are no constant.  Suicide is almost always on my mind.  And my determination to succeed seems to have strengthened.  


I have very little to complain about in life.  I have a job, I'm saving money.  I have some fantastic friends, and I live in a beautiful part of the world.  


I am alone though.  Every attempt I've made at having a relationship with a woman has failed.  Not always because of me.  But the feeling of being empty and alone is unbearable.  Partnership is hardwired into our dna and I seem to have been born into the perfect brain for avoiding it.

&amp;#x200B;

I just don't know what to do.  I want to end it.  I'm worried what it might do to my parents.  They are already on the  edge of a divorce that I believe has been coming since I was very young.  They have already shown themselves to be fairly incapable when it comes to helping me with my mental issues.  They knew I had ADD as a child but did nothing about it.  Hoping it would go away.  They've taken me to therapy for my depression, but I find it difficult to be honest about my feelings when I'm face to face with someone.  Because the few times I have been, it has lead to a response consisting of distance, and alienation, not compassion or empathy.  And even more often the simple words ""suck it up"".

&amp;#x200B;

I'm fairly sure I'll die by suicide.  Likely within the next few years.  My only goal is to try and patch up my relationships with family and loved ones so that  I can send myself off with the least amount of guilt possible.  I don't want to tear peoples lives apart.  I just wish I had never been born.  I don't feel lovable.  I don't feel as if I can really trust anyone.

Give me one reason to carry on with a life where I have been missing out on almost every joy imaginable.,"I never had a best friend. I'd never been part of a friend group. Or *a* group for that matter. I never felt accepted, not at my temporary job as a waiter, not in online chats, not in my class. Never had a girlfriend. Never kissed. Never had sex. Never had someone compliment me. Never had an unforgettable holiday trip. Never had a memorable spring break or summer break. Never went to a cool festival. Never had a great party. Never hosted one either. The list goes on and on and on. I feel lonely and my depression is physically weighing down on me. I have no motivation to do anything any more and my parents say they can read that off my face. 

I legit cannot remember the last time I had fun. Why would I even bother going on like this when I feel like I am just surviving each day rather than living. I am almost tempted to move to another country, start anew, and just go entirely crazy, but I feel like I would carry on the same way and be even more depressed.

I don't know who to talk to anymore...,"When I was around 6-7 y.o my dad got a scholarship in Australia. I was really happy to be there. I was someone who had lots of friends, exceptional grades, etc. But that turned 180° once I came back from Australia to my home country..I just don't know why.

Junior high was pretty average execpt my grades were starting to fall and I got the occasional teasing because I had a 'different' English accent. Then come high school when everything hit real hard. 

My grades were below par, my dad didn't allow me to hang out with friends, he started being a heli parent and would make irrational night curfews. I also got into numerous trouble with school. 

Over time, what I thought were my friends left me one by one. They even spread a rumor that I was gay (a big no in my country). And to top it off, my girlfriend cheated on me. I felt so desolate and unwanted. Ever since that I became socially awkward and has started to stutter/mumble in my speech. I thought about jumping off a roof but canceled

Eventually I just ate my depression and loneliness while at the same time gaining 10 kilos off it making me obese.

Last year I got accepted to uni in a city away from home. It gave me my much needed liberty away from my dad. I tried making friends, did the usual stuff but was shrugged off being not 'cool' enough or was just a plain awkward person. It kills me looking people left and right are with their friends or s.o being happy while there I am walking by myself alone to sit in class alone again.

Being in uni also made my mind grow wild. I've thought of many different ways of how ordinary objects can be used to kill me. I've tried swerving my motorbike onto an oncoming 18 wheeler but was too scared. I also bought a rope..a decision to use it thats been back and forth.

I can’t even attend next semester because I have no money. I was hit in a car accident on my bike and had to spend my tuition money on it. I also couldn’t afford insurance. I can’t get a loan for school so I’m fucked. There are no other options. I’ve maxed out my credit card for food and rent because I couldn’t work with a broken leg.

I have no friends or family to help me. Therapy is pointless. Hotlines don’t work. Group therapy doesn’t work. I’ve reached out for help like people said. It’s over. People always say “talk to a therapist” as if everything gets fixed but it doesn’t. Maybe for your small issues. 

I’ve never been loved or cared about. I only have myself. Now is the end. I’ve had depression since I was 8. I should’ve expected this.

I hate those damn Ubiquitous Suicide Hotline Posters.,"People need to realise and understand just how much bullshit suicide prevention is.

Because Yes, lets put posters to the suicide hotline a bit everywhere, look, we're only helping!

The suicide hotline! yes ! of course! why didn't I think of that?

All those things are there to make other people happy and fool them into thinking ""They're doing a great job helping!""  
You're really not.

How about this one? Force them to seek counselling  
Ah yes! Because talking about how I feel is going to make my problems go away! Of course  
Well, you'll get tools to /cope/ with those things, see -  
Oh! but it won't resolve any of the underlying issues, I see, you're only treating the symptoms of flesh eating  disease.

Institutionalisation?  
Well, how about fuck you Sheryl. Because isolating me even more really is going to help.  
But YOU can rest assured that /you did everything you could/! Look! the problem is no longer visible to you!
So therefore it must be working!   
Pat yourself on the shoulder, you did a great job!   
That person surely isn't going to fold into themselves even more than they already have
as they just sit around looking at blank walls, waiting for there next therapy session with doctors that are too rushed  
or overworked to care or do any good.  
It's like facing the corner for ""adults"". Think nice and hard about what you did! See you in three weeks!  

Well, how about numbing him AND therapy?   
Listen Maribeth, why do you think that's going to work? Because there's an entire industry around it?   
That must mean it HAS to be successful! Everyone! Everytime! Guaranteed!  
Surely it can ONLY /help/ those poor depressed souls, because the good doctor and the books say that it works
Surely their one follow-up call to re-make an appointment will change everything when they failed to show up  
Well, they didn't want to be here, on to someone that actually WANTS to be helped  
And the cycle... continues  

Surely taking pills to numb me to force me to sit in emotional comatose will   
Cure me of my autoimmune disease that will end me prematurally anyways  
Find me nice stable jobs that can work around my frequent and random stays at the hospital  
Stop jobs from firing me for invalid reasons because of it  
And extinguish an innumerable amount of very real fires in my life that set me down this path in the first place  

1.  
[Morris Moss: *picks up flaming fire extinguisher* I'll just put this over here... with the rest of the fire.](https://img.picturequotes.com/2/84/83812/ill-just-put-this-over-here-with-the-rest-of-the-fire-quote-1.jpg)  
2.  
[Cartoon Dog sitting at a table will the entire room is on fire. Close-up on his smiling face ""This is fine.""](https://static01.nyt.com/images/2016/08/05/us/05onfire1_xp/05onfire1_xp-articleLarge-v2.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale)   

can't people see why it doesn't work? why I push people away  
Even though I really really REALLY don't want to  
And it only hurts me even more  
permanently scaring the relationships that matter most to me  
never able to go back to how things were before  
inevitably helping me push myself to take the final jump  
when there is no one left around me  
when they all finally shut me out  
and none of them bother to reach out or care anymore  
or know that I finally jumped  

I feel stuck, Like an atom stuck on a plateau, trying to Fuse   
the only way to unlock my potential energy would be through quantum tunneling   
But you need to put outside energy in the system for it to work  
The only power that does work, is a firm grasping hand from ones we love the most,  
holding on with all their might despite the weight trying to sink ever deeper  
And the mightiest of tugs, going through that hill  
Holding on, as hard as they can, as they careen down the quantum waterfall in a burst of energy  

Not some stupid fucking poster.


and then what?

They leave. 

They always leave.

I'm cured.","So when your child's suicidal, self-harming, chronically depressed, and suffering abuse while you're away from the house, the obvious solution is to tell her that she's lying about everything and just needs to study harder because grades = good degree = good job = no more depresso. 

&amp;#x200B;

Wow. Genius, dad. I just need to stop FEELING and study my ass off. It makes so much sense. Why didn't I think of that?

&amp;#x200B;

And when I'm on the balcony crying and so close to jumping and you change the subject to this semester's grades again, I guess that's good too! Of course, grades are all that matter. 

&amp;#x200B;

And mom, I guess hating your child for being broken by your abuse is logical too! I  mean, how dare I make you feel bad by crying and trying to hang myself after you shook me and screamed in my face and told me I was no longer in the family? That's just what a child deserves for saying she doesn't love you! You're so damn right!

&amp;#x200B;

Where the hell did you think this was gonna go?

Did you actually think your idiocy would keep me alive?

Did you think you could fuck me up and then take all the credit when I claw my way to the top despite your best efforts to kill me?

I feel so lonely.,"
I want to talk to someone, anyone, with a desperate fervour. The subject doesn't matter, as long as the person is interested in talking to me.

I honestly can't remember a time when I *didn't* feel so alone, but lately it seems to have gotten even worse. Even people whom I once thought my friends seem to have lost any interest in me. I want to talk to *someone.*
But I also can't tell anyone about this, because I worry that they will only speak to me out of pity or a misguided sympathy.

I do not want either of those, I can not stand the mere thought of them. 
All I want, is to be genuinely liked. 
But I feel like I don't *have* anything to be liked for: I'm not funny, I'm not smart, I'm not charming, I can't even listen to people that well. Who would ever *want* to befriend me?",imjusttired5,13,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/fd1ura/i_feel_so_lonely/,want talk someone anyone desperate fervour subject matter long person interested talking honestly remember time feel alone lately seems gotten even worse even people thought friend seem lost interest want talk someone also tell anyone worry speak pity misguided sympathy want either stand mere thought want genuinely liked feel like anything liked funny smart charming even listen people well would ever want befriend,feel lonely,im tired 5
I’m unsure of everything,"I don’t know if I’m overreacting about my feelings or not. I’ve contemplated about suicide several times. I don’t want to live, but I’m too scared to actually try and kill myself. And then I feel like a piece of shit because I feel like I’m mocking the people who have actually attempted suicide, saying that I don’t want to live when I’m too much of a pussy to try ending it myself. I don’t know if I’m actually depressed, or going through that ‘edgy teen phase’. I’m too scared to get it diagnosed, as I’m too afraid of what the results might say. 
I’ve told my dad around 2~3 months ago about how I felt, but I don’t think he really cared. We basically had a small chat, and that was all.

My (25m) wife (24f) broke down crying today and confessed she has wanted to kill herself for the past three months. I don't know what to do.,"As the title says. I'd like to tag her reddit account but am unsure if that breaks any rules. I believe the only reason she is holding back is fear of what would happen to our 1year old son. She has attempted before in the past before we were married.

 Saying the last few months has been unkind to my family is a severe understatement. Lost my job and couldn't find work for several months that eventually led to our recent eviction. As a result, I've been forced to return to long haul truck driving so I am unable to physically be there for her while she stays at her extremely mentally abusive parents home. I've managed to secure her a better place to stay with a friend of mine and even a place for our dog, but thats the limit of what I can do. I'm bad at feelings, but I'm a good listener, and I am completely lost how to handle the situation. She wants to run away and feels as though she drowning. That nobody cares or doesn't want to notice. I am afraid she came forward to me today because she is getting ready to follow through, and I'm over a thousand miles away with no way home and *completely* out of my depth.

I had a bad day.,"Today was not a good day. I’ve been doing well for almost five months now and today was enough to put me back in a dark place. 

For those of you who monitor these posts to give advice, I’d really appreciate some right about now. I just don’t know how to control these urges anymore. 

I have a bad tendency to use alcohol to numb these feelings and thoughts. I know it’s not a good method. But it’s one that’s worked for me in the past.

What has worked for you in the past? How do you feel better when you’ve been beaten into submission again? What do you do? How do you distract yourself? How do you avoid these dark tendencies?

I’m just so afraid of falling back into the hole of depression. I thought I had escaped it, but like always, it has a magnificent ability to be able to drag me back down.

Please. I’d appreciate any positive feedback the community has.

Am I depressed?,"I'll try to be as transparent as possible without revealing too much. I am a high school senior, about to graduate in \~3 months. It feels like my life has been defined by the pressure to get good grades; and while I have done decently well in that regard, it has come at the expense at my social life and a lot of other things I value. I used to love the sport I played; now it feels like a burden to even show up to practice. I feel the same way about the other extracurricular activities I'm involved in. I've been rejected to several colleges/programs already, some of which I thought I had a decent shot at getting into. Occasionally, I have what I think are real suicidal impulses, but I know that I'm too much of a fucking pussy to do anything about it. The closer and closer I get to graduation, the lower my work ethic stoops, and the worse I feel about the utterly pathetic excuse of a human being that I now am.

My first post,"I have been diagnosed with major depression and anxiety years ago. Hi, I'm a 41 year old male with a good job, make good money, why should I be hurting? Depression, anxiety and suicide runs in my family. I have been committed to a 72 hour hold twice for being suicidal and planning my suicide. I do self harm. I think about suicide weekly, sometimes daily. I don't want medication but I self medicate with alcohol, work obsession or high risk sports. I'm embarrassed because I can't fit in with life, I'm broken with no fix. I suffer in silence as I don't want to bother my family, friends and girlfriend. I have planned my suicide many times, even tonight. Yes, I have written many suicide notes as well.

If I tell someone, they lock me up without shoelaces. This is not what I need, this causes me to hide it even more. I'm broken with no fix. I already go through cycles of being numb, angry, and sad. I don't want to feel numb from medication (I've been there before, what is the purpose.). I don't trust anyone to talk about this with, they respond with ways that make me hide my what I truly feel.

I want this pain to stop, the pain I've been feeling for years. Why am I broken? Besides not waking up, I don't know what else is the answer. I understand why my family member committed suicide, I get it, it isn't selfish, it is to stop the pain that many can't understand.

I don't know what to do. Do I end it, hide in silence and keep everyone happy, or say something and be even more miserable and in turn become more numb? Who really cares? I know alcohol doesn't help, but it helps me sleep, or if I don't drink here I am wide awake trying to make my brain quiet. I do high risk sports, secretly hoping that I will die.

I spent last night at the emergency room alone, I didn't contact my family, friends and erased a message for my girlfriend (I wasn't sure if it was a heart attack and didn't want to die alone but didn't want to bother anyone). My girlfriend saw some erased messages, so I told my girlfriend that it was some chest pain I wanted to make sure wasn't anything, I never told my family or friends and never will.

I don't know what to do, I need this to stop. This is my cycle, I'm numb or angry at everyone and push everyone way. If I wake up tomorrow, I will think whoever wrote this is an idiot and stupid, numb and ignorant to the pain I feel. Cycle repeats.

so long and thanks for all the fish,"I really want to die. I just don't have it in me to go on any longer. Every single day is pain. And I have really lost my patience to go through it all. This world is just too much. I just can't make myself heard. No one listens. No one understands my fears, my pain. I am tired of begging the ones close to me to understand me. It more than often seems that I am just a burden that they are carrying, and until everything is right with me, they are right, when something goes wrong with me and I need their help, they take up arms against me. I am very tired of all this. I am tired of this life. I don't want to live any more. There is absolutely no joy in my life, just pretence. Every smile is a pretence, every laugh is a sham trying to hide the screams I am screaming inside. And it has been going on for years now. I am so tired. If I were numb, I could have lived through any pain for a long long time, but unfortunately I am sensitive as fuck. I don't know how not to get affected by my mind. I don't know how not to get affected by all the rubbish overthinking that I do. It is all my fault. All my fault. I am a crack. I don't fit here amidst all these perfection, who just can't take my imperfection. I am so tired Maa. Come take me. I want to go back to you. I have had enough with this world. It has been such a long time since the warmth of your void. There was no pain. Nothing to cry the whole night about. No night. No day. Nothing. I was just nothing like you Maa. Why did I have to come here? I couldn't have asked for a life like this, where my own mind becomes my enemy, and I sit like a mute observer, unable to change anything. Just watching and suffering every consequences on this body which won't even be with me when I leave. Why do I suffer so much? What have I done to deserve so much pain? Have I given someone this much pain in life? Maybe I have. And maybe it is all coming back to me. So I beg you, whoever you are that makes all things go.. give it all to me once. Give all of whatever pain you have kept for me, all at once. And release me from this shell. I do not want it any more. I have no use for such an existence.

"Life is going nowhere, can’t walk, feel like a huge disappoitment and a burden.","Hey Reddit. I’ve been debating posting on here for a while but I’m having more suicidal thoughts than ever before and I just need to get this all of my chest. I’m 32, male. I have an amazing girlfriend who is way out of my league and a fun job I enjoy and yet, here I am. 

Despite having some really good parts of my life, I’m slammed by thoughts of being worthless and just living a pointless existence. I’m in debt up to my eyeballs and my credit is trashed. I feel like despite getting a $15,000 raise at work, I’m still nowhere near where I want to be at this point in my life. I feel like I have no tangible future and am just waiting to die one day. In the past 4 years I’ve lost my father and my grandmother, two of the most influential people in my life. I’m in the process of moving but am having a difficult time finding good apartments because of my credit so Ive been forced to stay with my mom until I’m settled. I travel for my job and my car is falling apart but I don’t have good replacement options again because of the credit issue. I’m ridden with anxiety about everything and fear of future issues prevents me from enjoying the now. To top it all off, I was visiting my girlfriend this weekend who lives a few hours away from me and I severely inured my knee and I can’t walk. I have to find a surgeon and probably have an operation and she wants to take care of me hand and foot but it just makes me feel like I’m a giant burden. She’s so amazing and I feel like I don’t offer anything financially and am just a 32 dependent who, as of right now can barely make it to the bathroom because of this damn leg. 

I am an atheist. I don’t believe in any form of an afterlife as I just can’t accept something with no evidence. I firmly believe in my heart that my grandmother and father are gone. Aside from their graves nothing remains of them and they are not in another realm enjoying themselves. All that exists for then is the black void of nothingness. And despite so many rays of sunshine in my dark life, I feel so envious of them. To not have to feel this anxiety and pain anymore is such an appealing feeling to me. This world is such a terrible place where ignorance and hate have run so rampant and people take such joy in hurting their fellow man. What future can society have with a foundation like this? I find myself thinking about ending everything on a near daily basis. I see lots of redditors posting here about how they are excited for some kind of afterlife because they can’t accept that this is the best we can do. But for me, an absence of anything would be as good as the existence of a heaven. 

I feel better having laid all this out in text but I still find myself objectively weighing the pros and cons of ending my life. So I don’t know what I was hoping for by posting this. Maybe I need someone to talk me off the ledge... who knows.

It took me attempting suicide to realise that I was right about nobody caring if I died.,"So last week everything got to me.

I've lost my son, wife, car, my home even and haven't eaten in 5 days as I have nothing to my name. Living off nothing but tap water for substance. I'm week and ill due to this.

My parents won't help, they say I'm a wimp for attempting.

My father said I was worthless and amount to nothing before offering to kick my face in for being a ""puff"" (rich as he's never worked in my entire life a day and mum's always provided for him while I've worked abroad, owned a home and much more but yeah).

My friends avoid me and don't want to hang around me, o only have a place to sleep thanks to my mother, but it's a rock hard floor and my father won't let me stay, eat or do anything there so in the day I'm cut lose to wonder the streets in the rain and cold. A problem as we've had a lot of major storms and even flooding here recently.

So last week I went to the lake I frequented as a child and hung myself. That was meant to be it. But in typical pathetic fashion I failed here too. The rope snapped.

I woke up a few minutes later, dizzy from the fall, unsure where I was due to the lack of oxygen. Eventually I recovered and went back to my parents to sleep. Wet, drenched, in pain and hungry. The next morning the abuse from my father began.

I'm 24 and I have nothing, only a few months ago I had everything and a newborn son. My ex wife took all that, took him thousands of miles away. I miss him more than anything.

But nobody cares I'm hungry, cold, alone. Nobody even cares I attempted suicide.

Not a single friend wants to spend time with me. My family hates me. My son isn't there to comfort me.

All I can take pride in now is my ability to end everything again soon, to finally have this all over, and this time I won't fail hopefully.",barkatthemoon777,11,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/fd38v7/it_took_me_attempting_suicide_to_realise_that_i/,last week everything got lost son wife car home even eaten 5 day nothing name living nothing tap water substance week ill due parent help say wimp attempting father said wa worthless amount nothing offering kick face puff rich never worked entire life day mum always provided worked abroad owned home much yeah friend avoid want hang around place sleep thanks mother rock hard floor father let stay eat anything day cut lose wonder street rain cold problem lot major storm even flooding recently last week went lake frequented child hung wa meant typical pathetic fashion failed rope snapped woke minute later dizzy fall unsure wa due lack oxygen eventually recovered went back parent sleep wet drenched pain hungry next morning abuse father began 24 nothing month ago everything newborn son ex wife took took thousand mile away miss anything nobody care hungry cold alone nobody even care attempted suicide single friend want spend time family hate son comfort take pride ability end everything soon finally time fail hopefully,took attempting suicide realise wa right nobody caring died,bark moon 777

"It comes in waves, but I’m really feeling it this time.","I have been dealing with depression since my mid-teens. It comes in waves. I go from a deep depression to a more mild feeling, but it’s always there. As I got older, the low tide began to stick around longer than the high tide. I have tried numerous prescriptions with no result, and no other form of therapy has caused the slightest change in the way I feel.

For the past year, I have lost all enjoyment in every aspect of my life. Usually this passes but this is the longest stretch I’ve had. It’s almost like I’ve come to some sort of acceptance that this is how I’m going to feel forever if I don’t end it.

The current climate of the world (I don’t mean Global Warming) has also pushed me the closest I’ve ever been to ending it. I used to enjoy movies, music, television and video games as a form of escape. I can’t enjoy them anymore. The hyper-politicalization of EVERYTHING has corroded away the enjoyment I received from the few things I used as an escape.

I am very good at hiding my feelings, and nobody knows about my thoughts and plans for suicide. My friends and coworkers all know me as an easy going, relaxed guy. I also don’t want them to know, so it’s a full time job on top of my job to keep it up, and it’s exhausting.

I made plans on how I would do it during my last low point, and I’m closer now than ever. I have all the means to pull it off, I just have to do it.

You know when you finally ask for help and someone pretends to help you but doesn’t really?,"I’ve been suffering for years and just this November I decided to tell my parents and ask for help because I couldn’t find a therapist on my own and wanted help. They listened, said a lot of “the right things” but near the end of the discussion they summed it up to stress and school and activities and tried to “fix my problems”. They agreed to search for a therapist though and a couple days later even told me they found someone and were waiting on a call back. It’s been about 4 months and there’s been nothing. When I ask they only say they’re waiting on a call back. I just want help. It’s gotten progressively worse and worse.

Suicide or be abused?,"It just feels like life is a stack of endless abuse and trauma from being born. I would prefer not to spend my life friendless, alone, and bullied or abused for what seems like just being alive. And I’m sick of explaining what’s going on. No one is helpful and ppl think their lives and perspectives and view points are the only ones that seem to exists. Life is truly miserable I can’t even get out of bed anymore. I use to want to fight to be a musician. For what? To continue being abused and mistreated? Fucking hell where does this shit end.


I guess the real question is how do people find ways to live for something they don’t mind being abused for. Something that is more gratifying than actually suffering. For me it is making music and sharing it. That’s all. If I don’t blossom as an artists I can’t see any other way to make the pain worth fighting on for. I really need to focus on my music even if It kills me trying to reach my goals. What else is there for me to be alive for. I hate being abused and hate most things in life. Having a mediocre job isn’t worth being mistreated for. I have to die trying to do something from my wildest dreams or I will pull my plug. I’m just talking about myself.

just alone and confused,"In October, I was assaulted by my then ex-boyfriend. Even though we had broken up in August,  I had reached out to him because he was one of the few people who knew that it was the year anniversary of the first time I was assaulted. And then he raped me. 

Since then, nothing has been good for me. I’ve had to withdraw from the semester because I’ve been too depressed to go to any classes. My relationships are falling apart because I’m not acting like myself anymore and no one wants to be around me. Or maybe I just want to be alone, I don’t know. I don’t sleep at night because I don’t feel safe in my own bed after what happened. And I feel like there’s no one I can talk to about anything because they’re all sick of hearing about it. Even the people I know I can trust aren’t options. If I told my mom or dad, they’d make me move back home, and that would just make things so much worse. My closest friends would try to push me to get hospitalized, which my family can’t afford. I stopped seeing my therapist because I felt like whenever I tried to open up emotionally, she would change the subject. I don’t know what to do or who to talk to anymore. 

I’ve wanted to kill myself before, and I’ve actually had several suicide attempts. Something about this time feels different. I know what I would do, and I’m not sure if I’m more afraid that it would actually work this time, or afraid of the slight possibility I could still survive. I know I don’t want to die, really, and that I just want the pain to stop. But there’s nothing I can do that makes anything feel easier anymore and I don’t know if I have the energy to keep trying.

I imagine myself feeling eternally shitty and a waste of a life. The hurt I have caused my SO has made me feel like I have no true identity. I wish I didn't have BPD. I wish I could have been better. I can wish and wish but that will never fix things. My body and mind feel useless I can distract myself with friends but I feel so distant from the world. I am filled with guilt. The worst part is knowing my SO has forgiven me and I can't help but think they may not want to be with me for much longer. I would crumble and disappear without him. I am filled with so much pain... pain that I deserve to feel. I wish I could disappear but thinking about dying is horrifying. If the world goes on just the same without me. If I fade into a distant memory to those who I know. I know I need more external help. But no amount of therapy will rid me of the thoughts I have about myself. I fear I will never grow from this. It all seems so dark and temporary.,notconsoled,0,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/fd5nm1/hurting_and_i_deserve_it/,people say bad decision always make someone bad person really feel like true case imagine feeling eternally shitty waste life hurt caused ha made feel like true identity wish bpd wish could better wish wish never fix thing body mind feel useless distract friend feel distant world filled guilt worst part knowing ha forgiven help think may want much longer would crumble disappear without filled much pain pain deserve feel wish could disappear thinking dying horrifying world go without fade distant memory know know need external help amount therapy rid thought fear never grow seems dark temporary,hurting deserve,consoled

"It's not the depression, it's me","I mean yes never feeling happiness, always feeling tired, and all that other shit that comes with depression would've contributed to this, but I think I'm just using depression as an excuse to hide the fact that I'm a terrible person.

I've had depression since at least the age of 10. I'm 17 now and until about a year or two ago my depression was never a huge problem. I was passing school, I had friends and I had hobbies. But one day after my suicide attempt I got a random boost in motivation, and I felt happiness for the first time in years. Feeling happiness only made me realize how miserable I am all the time, which led to me figuring out that I have depression.

Ever since I became aware of this, I started doing things like, failing school, ghosting friends, and dropping out of hobbies. Whenever I smile or laugh, I hide it and try my best to make myself sad. I fetishized my sadness, sadness was my happy place, and being happy was painful for me. I feel like I'm just putting on a play for myself to hide the fact that I'm just a selfish ass, who does nothing but play videogames all day. Now here's a good confession, I don't have a suicide attempt, yeah when the the day came I was to lazy to get out of bed and walk to the railway so I just didn't. Yet everyone I've told my story to has heard me talk about my suicide attempt, I told myself this so much that I actually forgot I never even tried for a while, but it's all a lie, just an excuse to make me look more broken then I already am. Some days I think of actually going there, and reenacting that moment to see if I'll actually do it or not, but I'm to lazy to get out of bed so as if I'd do that.

I fear that my therapist will find out. That if I get cured from my depression that I'm still going to be just as shitty as always and that it was just me all along. If that's true then that means there's no curing me, and that I'm just going to be like this forever.",Souless_F0X,1,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/fd5mg3/its_not_the_depression_its_me/,mean yes never feeling happiness always feeling tired shit come depression would contributed think using depression excuse hide fact terrible person depression since least age 10 17 year two ago depression wa never huge problem wa passing school friend hobby one day suicide attempt got random boost motivation felt happiness first time year feeling happiness made realize miserable time led figuring depression ever since became aware started thing like failing school ghosting friend dropping hobby whenever smile laugh hide try best make sad fetishized sadness sadness wa happy place happy wa painful feel like putting play hide fact selfish doe nothing play videogames day good confession suicide attempt yeah day came wa lazy get bed walk railway yet everyone told story ha heard talk suicide attempt told much actually forgot never even tried lie excuse make look broken already day think actually going reenacting moment see actually lazy get bed fear therapist find get cured depression still going shitty always wa along true mean curing going like forever,depression,u le f 0 x

People die every day, so what would make it different if I disappear? NOTHING! I decided to hang myself in the bathroom.

I cried with pain and satisfaction that I will be leaving this earth then the shower curtain rod in my bathroom broke...

2-16-2020,"on the morning of February 16 2020 i took my cat to the emergency vet to have her checked out. she was extremely skinny and was not moving and hadnt eaten or used the bathroom in 2 days. she barely wanted to be around anyone and her muscules were so weak she couldnt even use her back legs or stand. she would just drag herself to where she wanted to go then lay down exhausted. i thought she was going to die the night before but miraculously she survived but was still extremely weak and exhausted looking.

i put her in her pet cage and drove to the emergency vet. the vet examined her and immediately became accusatory and critical of me and how my kitty got into the position that she was in, asking me every question under the sun what did i give her to eat? whats her past medical history? and maybe about 40 other questions.  even calling my cat a train wreck. she was in horrible condition and he kept telling me things such as ""well if you wouldve taken her to your regular vet and had checkups sooner, all of this couldve been prevented"" ""you should've given her her medicine. hyperthyroidism is manageable and bc you didnt do this and that your cat is in the condition that shes in""   which just made me feel so damn guilty. i wanted to take her away right then and there. he then tells me that he couldnt feel her liver and that she only had 25% of her kidneys working and that she was extremely dehydrated.

he mentioned giving her medicine and iv drips and changing her diet but because of the state she was in, he said it wouldn't do much at all at this point because her kidneys would eventually fail. so then he suggests euthanasia. and my heart dropped like a rock. i didnt want to do it. i wanted to give her the medicine i was hell bent on it. ill pay it now, i dont care what the price is ill pay it now! but he kept pushing me and my sister to sign up for a credit plan to pay for it because he simply ""didnt want to be the bank"" he even said that we could give her all of the medicine and change her diet etc and theres a possibility that it still wont work at all because of how debilitated she was. 

eventually our family made the decision to have her put to sleep on the same day as the visit. we had a previous cat who passed away due to kidney failure and we didnt want her to go through the same thing. we all snuggled her, kissed her and pet her until she breathed her final breath on the table. it was heart wrenching. we didnt want to bring her home because we all live with out 80 year old grandmother who prior to having her put to sleep, my grandmother would see her dragging her legs and see how weak and exhausted she looked and would start crying and saying how she didnt want to see the cat suffer like that anymore.  we didnt want to bring her home because we didnt want anything to happen to grandma so  we had everything done in one day and it all happened so fast. im still torn about it. i feel like i can go back in time and pull her away from the table, and bring her to present day. 

i miss you so much misty,  my little baby. it felt like we all yanked you out of this world too soon and thats what drives me crazy. the regular vet i tookher to long ago when we first found out about it told us all that she had hyperthyroidism. all 3 of us were in charge of making sure she got her medicine until she finished it, and then it dwindled down to just me having the responsibility. i was in a very stressed out mindset between my shit job with no set hours,  and  taking care of my grandmother who has dementia.we have to make sure she dosent wander outside or anything. and had completely forgotten/ was counting on other family members to give her her medicine because i was not home. i had forgotten that she even took  medicine at all because she was doing so well. she was eating, and playing until about last year when i went to have her ears checked. thats when they reminded me. and it all went downhill. 

so again i gave her her medicine and she  finished it. only to find out this year she would have to be put to sleep. i never intended to hurt you misty, i never wanted you to get so sick. every morning i cry my eyes out wishing you were here with me on my bed or licking my hand or even meowing that cute little ""hello"" meow you used to do. every day i think about the what ifs and the if onlys. i cant even smell or look at certain things anymore, i cant smile or be happy anymore without my baby. 
i bought a box cutter last week because i was seriously contemplating ending my own life because of the horrible guilt. i feel like i murdered that cat. i feel like i purposefully let her get sick and die . i felt like she didnt need to be euthanized. it was my responsibility to make sure you got your medicine and i fucked up so bad. i dont want to live anymore feeling like this. im so sorry my sweet baby kitty.   how can i help my grandmother if i failed to help you? i feel like im the only one in the world dealing with this situation. i  know im not, but i just want to fucking die. i hate existing. everyday i wake up im reminded that my cat is gone. my best friend, my baby is dead and i caused it and i want to throw up. i hate living i want to die and just not feel anything im so sorry misty im so sorry",Feather_Lightswitch,3,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/fd25b3/2162020/,morning february 16 2020 took cat emergency vet checked wa extremely skinny wa moving hadnt eaten used bathroom 2 day barely wanted around anyone muscules weak couldnt even use back leg stand would drag wanted go lay exhausted thought wa going die night miraculously survived wa still extremely weak exhausted looking put pet cage drove emergency vet vet examined immediately became accusatory critical kitty got position wa asking every question sun give eat whats past medical history maybe 40 question even calling cat train wreck wa horrible condition kept telling thing well wouldve taken regular vet checkup sooner couldve prevented given medicine hyperthyroidism manageable bc didnt cat condition shes made feel damn guilty wanted take away right tell couldnt feel liver 25 kidney working wa extremely dehydrated mentioned giving medicine iv drip changing diet state wa said much point kidney would eventually fail suggests euthanasia heart dropped like rock didnt want wanted give medicine wa hell bent ill pay dont care price ill pay kept pushing sister sign credit plan pay simply didnt want bank even said could give medicine change diet etc possibility still wont work debilitated wa eventually family made decision put sleep day visit previous cat passed away due kidney failure didnt want go thing snuggled kissed pet breathed final breath table wa heart wrenching didnt want bring home live 80 year old grandmother prior put sleep grandmother would see dragging leg see weak exhausted looked would start cry saying didnt want see cat suffer like anymore didnt want bring home didnt want anything happen grandma everything done one day happened fast im still torn feel like go back time pull away table bring present day miss much misty little baby felt like yanked world soon thats drive crazy regular vet tookher long ago first found told u hyperthyroidism 3 u charge making sure got medicine finished dwindled responsibility wa stressed mindset shit job set hour taking care grandmother ha dementia make sure dosent wander outside anything completely forgotten wa counting family member give medicine wa home forgotten even took medicine wa well wa eating playing last year went ear checked thats reminded went downhill gave medicine finished find year would put sleep never intended hurt misty never wanted get sick every morning cry eye wishing bed licking hand even meowing cute little hello meow used every day think ifs onlys cant even smell look certain thing anymore cant smile happy anymore without baby bought box cutter last week wa seriously contemplating ending life horrible guilt feel like murdered cat feel like purposefully let get sick die felt like didnt need euthanized wa responsibility make sure got medicine fucked bad dont want live anymore feeling like im sorry sweet baby kitty help grandmother failed help feel like im one world dealing situation know im want fucking die hate existing everyday wake im reminded cat gone best friend baby dead caused want throw hate living want die feel anything im sorry misty im sorry,2 16 2020,feather light switch
It's over and there is just nowhere else to go.,"I think this could be it. I'm really just not able to grasp this world. This is not where I want to be. 

People are just so fucked. It doesn't matter where they come from, what they do, or even really how they act. There is just an insufferable defect in humanity's existence. I am 100% for an extinction event. I'm no longer in a panic about climate change or anything like that, I want it to accelerate. I don't want to be here when shit hits the fan, but I want it to happen. I am now certain that we are incapable of a better future where these defects do not exist. The same story keeps playing out over and over again, the only difference is now it is playing out on smart phones. People are just fucked. 

People call me a failure and I laugh. The tragedy is that there is no glory in this world. You could win a million bucks in the stock market and you are still going down with the rest of us. We see the way that the most powerful people in the world act every day. Some idiot decided to give them all Twitter accounts. Oh my gosh, what a riot. It has got to the point where the weak are still the weak and the strong just look dumber than everyone else. 

Obviously this is not the kind of attitude that anyone would want to put up with so I should leave to avoid pissing anyone else off even though I am absolutely right. I like to tell myself that having a better attitude means accepting a wrong position for the sake of getting along with everyone else walking off the cliff. Well there are two options, I can be right and go crazy stranded alone outside the herd or I can be wrong and feel good about myself because I have people walking into the abyss with me. What a stupid, stupid fate. Well there is a third option, I could kill myself. 

I don't even want to hear some people have it worse. I'm sorry but hearing about 6 billion people who have it worse doesn't brighten my day. Try harder, try again. You're not going to make me feel any better by reminding me my country, my tax dollars contribute significantly to their peril by bombing many of those people into ruins for the sake of politicians and bureaucrats who have literally become Twitter trolls. It's not funny, I mean it. 

I want to kill myself. I have had it in my mind for a long time but there was something spiritually holding me here. I wonder if that has passed. I don't see anymore goal posts. I'm begging desperately for a sign because as much as I want it to stop I'm a coward who fears death. But the pressure comes sometimes so hard, so intense that I'm not thinking about fear or any of that. Those are the moments where I know it might happen. 

This post may get deleted for inciting activism but for me personally I do not care what you do or what your social positions are. We are all collectively collapsing, so I don't care who you vote for or what you believe. These are just the thoughts driving me toward alienation and inevitably perhaps death. I'm not even looking forward to a girlfriend anymore. I can only imagine waking up every day and telling her we are all doomed, or better yet lying to her face and saying everything is alright.

Advice on finally maybe starting to get help,"Hi everyone,

For the first time EVER I am going to speak to someone tomorrow about my suicidal ideation, which has plagued me for 10 years. 

I'm currently at uni, and booked an appointment with a student support officer from my school. She's not a counsellor, but can deal with academic issues (which I'm having because of the big sad), and refer students onto mental health services.

I'm absolutely shit scared. I've never really spoken to anyone about how I feel, only a couple of times drunkenly to a few friends (who've never brought it up again). I just feel like it's time because things have gotten worse recently, and I'll be graduating this summer which is terrifying. 

I'm not really sure where to start with the meeting, or about what I should say? I've never met her before, I just emailed to book a meeting.

Let me know if this is the wrong sub. I'm basically just wanting to know how to start the conversation and how much detail to go into. It feels way too intense to just sit down and be like hi nice to meet you I think about killing myself every day and have a pile of suicide notes on my desk. I also don't want to be sectioned lol.",throwaway_sad_2020,6,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/fd51kc/advice_on_finally_maybe_starting_to_get_help/,hi everyone first time ever going speak someone tomorrow suicidal ideation ha plagued 10 year currently uni booked appointment student support officer school counsellor deal academic issue big sad refer student onto mental health service absolutely shit scared never really spoken anyone feel couple time drunkenly friend never brought feel like time thing gotten worse recently graduating summer terrifying really sure start meeting say never met emailed book meeting let know wrong sub basically wanting know start conversation much detail go feel way intense sit like hi nice meet think killing every day pile suicide note desk also want sectioned lol,advice finally maybe starting get help,throwaway sad 2020
Put on actual suicide watch by my therapist,"Today I had an appointment with my therapist and let her know about the suicidal thoughts I’ve been having. She wanted to have me committed, but I was able to convince her that I didn’t need to be hospitalized. She let me leave her office under the condition that I check in with her every twelve hours with a text. If she didn’t hear from me at the agreed upon times, she would send EMTs to my house. 

I’m glad I was able to be honest about what I was feeling and that she was willing to compromise on the type of intervention used.",lobsterjellyhammer,1,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/fd2j1w/put_on_actual_suicide_watch_by_my_therapist/,today appointment therapist let know suicidal thought wanted committed wa able convince need hospitalized let leave office condition check every twelve hour text hear agreed upon time would send emts house glad wa able honest wa feeling wa willing compromise type intervention used,put actual suicide watch therapist,lobster jelly hammer

I have no one to turn to.,"My father passed away last year. I feel incredibly alone now, he was my go-to person whenever I had a problem. I left my job to take some time off after he passed. I've left two more jobs since then, I just can't handle any of it any more. My gf, who I've been staying with, wants me to leave so she can ""find herself.""

I can't blame her really.

My father's gf, whom he was with at the time of his passing and for the previous 15 years or so, has already moved on and started dating a guy that I don't think dad would approve of, either.

I don't know who to turn to or what to do. I have a little bit of money saved up so I'm not in immediate danger, and I think I've worked it out with my gf to stay here until I find a job? I just don't hold out a ton of hope. Whenever I think of getting another job, most likely in a field I hate anyway (recruiting), I just think ""what's the point?"" Like I really don't have a ton to live for at this juncture. 

I don't want it to be this way and I just can't seem to figure a way out of it that would give me a good quality of life. It all just feels pointless.

I've tried to look up free or low cost therapists in the area, I have a couple numbers but trying to read about state funded mental health care and I couldn't make heads or tails of the webpage.

"Just got diagnosed borderline, and trying on new meds, I need help","My first post ever on reddit. Im feeling so low right now, been crying all night, and I just want to get better, but nothing seems to work. During Christmas vacation, I realised my partner had been cheating on me, the night I founded out, he went to that girl house and had intercourse with her. He still came back to my place after and told me everything the next day. I completely lost it, It was the first time someone cheated on me. I felt betrayed, and couldnt wrap my head around it. My reaction was to drink as much alcool, smoke cigarette until I could forget what happen.. unfortunately that wasnt enough I was still feeling so much pain. I than decides to take a half empty bottle of xanax with a bottle of antidepressant. Just to wash the pain away, just like that I was doing my first suicide attempt.  20 minutes after I realised what I had done and called emergency, an ambulance came over and I spent 24 hours at psychiatry aisle. I started seeing a psychiatrist after that, and was diagnosed for borderline personality. For me it makes sense, but it seems close friend and family think its too much, that Im not borderline.. thing is Im really good at hiding my true self. Ive been boulimic for years without anyone ever knew I was. Ive been having intense rage and impulsive reaction when Im in love. 

Anyway.. lets come back to my story, I ended up staying with my partner, a decision that has been torturing me ever since. There is not a day that passes without me thinking he would so ut again. I will think about what happened imagining it until I start feeling sick, and than everything turns black again. I havent been easy with him after that, but how could I ? 

My psychiatrist just prescribed me a new drug to mix with my antidepressants and I started them yesterday, I hate all the side effect if taking a new drugs and I just feel like I want to give up. ive been having a lot of fights with my partner in the last days cause I dont find him supportive. I feel so alone right now, I tried to communicate with him but its just too much, I feel like a burden for him and its been breaking me even more.

There is so much in life that I wanted, like I always wanted to have a kid, but I feel so unlovable... I feel like my mental health is taking too much place, I need help.

Am I the only one who doesn’t really care if I’m sent to the psych ward because I told my therapist too much?,"I don’t really want to die, I want to stop being so fucked up. And if the best way to do that is to kill myself, that’s the route I’ll take. But that isn’t the only route available, and if there’s a way for that to happen through medication or mental healthcare I’ll gladly choose that. But the problem is I don’t really care if I live or die, so if that course of action is too difficult I’ll just take the easy way out and kill myself (I say easy because it’ll be easy for me, but the main thing that’s preventing me from doing it is how other people will take it).

That being said, I’m not going to avoid saying something to my therapist because I think he’ll send me to a psych ward. The best chance I have to get better through meds and therapy is to be honest with what’s going on, and I’m completely fine with that. I don’t really have anything going on in my life I wouldn’t mind sacrificing a week for. Hell, I’m well prepared to sacrifice my own life in order to stop the pain. I’ve been to a psych ward before, and it’s kind of nice since it’s a way to kind of die a temporary death and be away from everything else in my life. It’s not as good as death though, since I’ll still be fucked up in the head and as long as I’m fucked up I’ll suffer, but it’s better than suffering and still having to do shit.

Terrible Suicide Case?,"  I am a weak and small person that know one respects.  I am treated like shit and abandon by society.  I am aggressive to people.  I think about murdering and killing others.  I take out rage on myself and pretend to slaughter the people that constantly disrespect and hurt me.

I am a hopeless one.  I am loading the bullet and not caring for what anyone thinks.  I don't care for life anymore.  I am accepting my fate.  I am glad that I am choosing to kill myself because it gives my a mature understanding of the cold and brutal reality of the human race.  I don't go to counselors or therapists. I like being this way.  Cold and sad makes me feel happy.  I have lost interest in friends, activities and prefer to be alone.

I've been planning for years.,"Over the course of my life, I have attempted suicide four times. Each time, I was hospitalized, and each time I've tried again. The last times, it failed because someone found and stopped me. My ex boyfriend commit suicide last year. I have difficulty making plans due to a mild obsessive compulsive disorder, and just finding time. 
I have a heart condition that has been steadily worsening after a miscarriage, and due to it, I can't hold down a regular job and have since resorted to online work that pays like shit. I'm homeless. I have only two people in any sort of position to provide support, emotionally. And even though it's looking like the most difficult parts of life are ending and getting better for me, I don't honestly believe a life with all these new restrictions is worth it. 
My family is going on vacation soon. I wasn't invited. That week, I can complete the steps the way I planned, if I want to. Now the question is if I even have the physical strength for one last shot at it. 
Who knows? 
It might fail again. But I have no doubt I'll keep trying. It's the only thing I haven't given up on.
Meditation and such seems to point me in this direction. Tarot readings, horoscopes, all of it seems to be dropping hints that this is it. The main difference between all the times before, is that this time, I have nothing left to be afraid of.

Should I visit a psychiatrist?,"M/16, currently going through depression and can't talk to anyone. I've been visiting a psychotherapist for about 2 years and a psychiatrist for several weeks but just decided to stop going there like 6 months ago. I've been diagnosed with social anxiety and have depression but never actually talked about that with anyone, not even with my parents or the therapists. My everyday life goes like this: wake up, survive 7 hours at school, come home, play video games for rest of the day since I don't have anything better to do, cry into sleep, repeat. In school I barely speak to anyone even though I am going in the same class for over 5 years now. Only have 1-2 friends but they mostly only see me as the last choice everytime and only want to meet up when no one else has time. Recently we got someone new in the class and it seems like he had more social contact with the everyone else in the past 3 days than me in the last 5 years. Everyone think's i am introverted and it's kinda true, but only because I get rejected by everyone I even try to talk to and get excluded from everything. When people throw parties, I never get invited but people they barely talk to get invited. My grades are horrible and I am about to get off the school and don't even know what I want to become, since i just stopped caring after I noticed that everyone ignores me and no matter how hard I try to build up a new friendship / contact, I get rejected. I am the kind of person to look at my phone and than ask someone what time it is just so I have somewhat of a social interaction lmao. My parents only see my grades but don't care about my feelings. Because of this happening over many years (basically my whole life) I began to hide behind a emotionless mask. I am not able to express my feelings. nothing. The only thing i can do is laugh (because of something funny, not because i am actually happy) or hate on something. Even if anyone would make me happy, e.g. inviting me to a party, I couldn't show it and still act bored / emotionless because I am too afraid what people would think when I suddenly change and behave like everyone else. I also don't know anymore how to feel empathy. Like i would really like to and empathize with someone but no matter how hard I try it just doesn't work. When someone is sad I can say to myself ""this person is sad"" and feel bad about it, but I cannot comprehend it. I also feel absolutely worthless. For example I don't even say hi/goodbye to most people since i think i am not worth their time. When I meet someone from school outside accidentally, I walk pass them and they walk past me just because I don't want the other person to feel awkward. I know they don't like me and their day is probably ruined just by seeing me so i don't try to force the contact. At this point in my life i noticed that people are just assholes not caring about anyone. Everyone has their perfect life and ignores me so trying further wouldn't change anything. I honestly don't know what to do anymore. In the past i began to think more often about how it would be if just killed myself. I am not really thinking about doing it, but honestly I couldn't care less if I just got hit by a but. I feel like visiting the psychiatrist / therapist wouldn't change anything since I am not being honest to them anyways and don't know how I could be. Anyone good experiences with psychiatrist? Did it help in your case?

Life is unbearable. I'm losing my mind. I wish I had the courage to end this shit. Praying that someone out there reads this.,"I've been realizing some damn hard truths about myself. I've never been happy, ever since I was a little kid I felt like I was ""bad"". You know how children play ""house"" and it can be used in therapy to evaluate their outlook and issues? When I was a kid, I would play ""house"" with my fingers: there was the mom, dad, brother, and sister (me, the pinky finger). Each time, everyone would gang up on and beat up the sister. I just remembered that I used to ""play"" that game the other day - I don't think I have any real excuse for that, I was anxious as hell from a young age and irritable as fuck, but what kind of kid thinks of that shit? I was messed up back then.


I've talked to professionals. They seem to think that this is more than anxiety and depression. They say that I've faced a lot of trauma in my life. I suppose it makes sense. My parents were heavily abused during their childhoods, my mom even tried to kill herself as a young kid. My dad was an abusive alcoholic for most of my childhood. He and my mom would fight a lot - they would swear at each other, he would hit and throw things at her, she would scream at him and they would usually tell each other to go to Hell or drop dead. My dad was verbally abusive, and I remember he would hit my brother too. I presume he hit me, but I don't remember. All I remember is that when I was a teenager, he got so angry at me that he held me down on the couch. I was so detached, all I thought was how he was so angry he was about to drool on me, and how it was gross. I love my parents, despite their flaws. I just don't like them. We fight all the time. When I was younger, I remember that often when I got into a row with one parent, the other would get involved and then they would fight with each other. They would say horrible things like what I said above. They would say awful things to me too, like how once I was mad and my mom said I should look in the mirror to see how ugly I look. She would tell me to ""get out of her sight"" a lot. I get called a bitch at times. I'm told I treat them horrible, and I hate myself even more when they say that. Ugh. On the note of trauma, I realized earlier this year that I was repeatedly raped (oral, not vaginal) by my ex over the course of a year or so. That's also been tough to process.

It's fucked because I know my parents love me. They read to me as a child, they taught me to be independent. They just want me to be happy. But there's just always been something missing, I guess.

I realized that I may be in a chronic state of mild dissociation. I often feel detached from my body, my emotions, my environment, other people. I feel like I'm in a fog. My limbs aren't quite attached to my body, I feel floaty or dizzy. Weak and shaky. At times I dissociate harder, and I go totally numb. Can't move. Can't talk. Things look smaller, I float above or behind my body. My vision gets weird. It's scary yet comfortable because I'm aware that I'm further detached from myself and in a limbo for an hour. It fades and I get a headache, my body hurts, and I'm exhausted. Then it's back to reality, and I feel even more off for the rest of the day. I've noticed I also mildly dissociate when I try to sleep. My head is disconnected from my body, my limbs feel large or disconnect from my body. It's incredibly disturbing and I don't know why it happens. I never even realized I apparently dissociate until I started thinking about my childhood. Experienced some crazy depersonalization and derealization. When it happened, I realized that it was *very* familiar and I remembered doing it a lot as a kid. That realization fucked me up.


What really makes me feel crazy is the apparent somatic symptoms. I developed chronic visual snow and headaches as a teenager. I also started getting ocular migraines. Numerous tests and exams showed that all is well - it's just stress. My mouth has been hurting for the past year, as well. I even got an extra wisdom tooth removed, thinking that was the source of the pain. Nope. The pain persists, and is very noticeable when I'm stressed. Xrays and exams show that things are fine. I feel like a damn hypochondriac or like I'm malingering...but this is all very real to me.


I feel weak a lot. I am also dizzy, or like my brain is rotting, or stuffed with cotton/fog. My head is never ""clear"". I can't focus on much. Working is difficult. I can't truly interact with friends or family anymore. My weight has been all over. Due to horrible anxiety, I had lost a third of my body weight in 9 months. When I fell into this double depression, I lost 14 pounds in 2 weeks. Then someone I care about confronted me about the seriousness of it all. I tried to maintain my weight, and it worked for a month. Then I had a little breakdown and lost 7 pounds in 5 days. Started an antidepressant and became apathetic as hell - had an aborted suicide attempt and binge ate like crazy even though I wasn't hungry. I was like ""fuck it I deserve to gain weight and look disgusting"". I've gained 10 pounds in a week. I hate myself so much.


The more I realize, the more I hate myself. I've tried six or seven antidepressants, I've tried therapy a few times and am trying again. On another med right now. It all feels so damn hopeless. I've wanted to die since I was 13, and every day is just full of more pain and despair. 


People tell me not to give up on myself, but it gets more and more tempting as time goes on. Ever since I was 15, I always had a strong feeling I would die by suicide. I figured I wouldn't kill myself until I was 27 or 28, but things are becoming more disasterous. I just wish I had the courage to end this suffering soon. I feel like such a disgusting coward and a fraud.

I'm invisible,"Granted I'm known by many acquaintances but have zero friends. I am often repeating myself because so called friends don't listen or dont hear me or frankly, don't give a shit. I've been suffering from bipolar disorder, manic depression, for upwards of 18 years. I told myseld if I could just make it past 27 yrs things would get better. I've been hospitalized, most recently in September 2019, the staff basically said they don't treat us but just monitor us until we are stable on meds and fit to leave. I have no family, raised in the foster care system and I'm completely alone. I don't see the point in living anymore if I'm constantly in mental agony or being ignored or used on every level. I've taken care of people I thought were friends because I have so much love to give but misguided as usual I end up used and thrown out like a tissue or ignored blatantly. I can't keep a job so my stability is often rocked by my own uncontrollable emotions and outbursts and I can't cope anymore. I'm losing hope and honestly just would like someone to acknowledge that I am alive and a sensitive but real person. Even then I don't know how to curb the feelings and thoughts of suicide. My closest friends growing up have all passed, either by suicide or excessive drug use I'm honestly debating the same path because without them I'm more alone than ever. 
Idk if reddit is the place for this but at the very least I'm getting this out and have one outlet to speak on my real feelings. I've sought therapy and a psych for meds but it seems like they never want to hear the bad or try to ""silver lining"" my struggles by saying I'm so strong....I'm tired, no exhausted, from being so strong.

Coming to terms that maybe I just want to end it all and be done with it.,"I’ve had suicidal thoughts for a very long time. I’ve seen my GP, been put on meds, I’ve been to counselling you name it I’ve tried. But apart of me just feels like I’ve had enough and the only option is just to end my life. Sounds dramatic and selfish but if I’m honest I just feel like I have nobody there for me anymore and I’m just disappointing people around me like my parents for example, I know deep down that I’m just a failure in their eyes and all I’m doing is prolonging more upset for them as I’ve made there lives difficult in certain aspects with my depression and constantly making them worry. But I also feel as tho if I end it then there wouldn’t be that worry I’d then be gone. if I speak to my friends about it they’ll just turn around and say man up or stop being soft. Which has now just caused me to believe that I don’t have anyone there close to me to talk to, feel like Cant rely on anyone anymore and I just would be better off dead. Me and my ex split 6 months ago a short term relationship but that was one thing I felt really happy about and that ended because of how I am, just sad and perhaps not all there, or perhaps I’m just not capable in being in a relationship as there’s just clearly something wrong with me. I don’t see myself moving on from her to another as it shattered me deeply and I just can’t seem to want to get back out there, I just don’t believe I’m that type of person for anyone like she was at the time. Many things I could add to the list like I’m mid 20s I only have a part time job and I don’t feel motivated or want to look for a career because I just don’t feel I’m good enough anymore. Feels as though I’m really done with life and that my times is up and I don’t really know what to do anymore. I’m just sad and existing in a world that I don’t want to be apart of anymore and I’m typing this really because I don’t know who else to talk to about it anymore. I just want to crawl in a ball and cry every day and I wake up and go to sleep thinking I want to be dead.

A story to hopefully bring you back from the brink of suicide...,"Hi there, I don’t know if this will help you at all, but if it helps even one person, that’s enough for me. A bit of back ground information, I am a 22 year old that has been suffering from severe depression for the past year, with suicidal thoughts everyday of every hour. I felt like I was already dead cause no one seemed to notice me and I was slowly wasting away from the inside out. I also began to hear voices that would constantly berate me and tell me to kill myself, and after this, I sought help from my GP and was put onto anti-depressants (Sertraline) which did absolutely nothing. They didn’t make it worse, but they certainly didn’t make it better.

I was then put onto another anti-depressant (Mirtazapine) which I started taking at the beginning of February 2020, which seemed to help. I had the energy to finally get out of bed, take a shower and leave the house. But a couple of weeks ago, I noticed that although I had the energy to get up and go about my daily life, I was still thinking about killing myself everyday, but this time it was different as I had the energy and motivation to actually come up with a detailed plan and go through with it; and this scared me so much as I have never felt an urge to kill myself as much as I have in the last couple of weeks. 

So yesterday, I had a lot to deal with. My partner has been very sick with an unknown illness for nearly a year, so his parents rushed him to hospital. I was an absolute mess as I have been really struggling to 
silence the suicidal thoughts, whilst also fulfilling my duty as a carer for my partner. I had a mental breakdown after they took him to the hospital as the voices wouldn’t stop. I actually began shouting back at them, but after a few minutes sobbing on the bathroom floor, I became completely numb and decided to follow through with my plan. 

I grabbed my supplies, which involved a dog lead, but I had made sure to buy this one especially for this occasion as it perfectly fit around my neck and had a sturdy metal clip which I could attach to the banister which would hold my weight. I was ready to do it, I was ready to go, and I put the collar around my neck and began to push my neck down into the collar to cut off the blood supply to the main artery in my neck, I heard this would only take a minute or so to make me unconscious, and the whole time I was holding my dog close to my chest cause I was so scared, but I wanted to die so badly. As I could feel myself going, I stopped. And I don’t know what stopped me, but part of me thought that it wasn’t my time to go. So I ended up picking up the phone and calling someone, who managed to calm me down and helped me look at everything from a different perspective. 

I know a lot of people will say that it’s selfish for feeling suicidal or committing suicide due to the hurt it would cause to family/friends etc but from what I felt yesterday, none of that mattered. I truly believed that I wanted to die, and if I hadn’t have stopped myself when I had, I would probably be dead now. 

But this morning, my partner finally got an official diagnosis of what has been making him so ill. I am currently sat in the hospital waiting for him to come out of surgery, and I have been told by the doctors that he is going to live a very healthy, normal life after this operation. If I had have killed myself yesterday afternoon, I would never have gotten to find out that my partner was going to be okay. I would never get to marry him in April. I would never get to see him healthy and happy again. All of these things I would have never known if I was dead now. I can now look forward to being able to spend time with my partner who can now start to enjoy his life again, and I can try and enjoy mine as much as I can knowing that he will be around for a long time. 

What I’m trying to get at after my long ass story, is that if there is any sort of hope you can cling onto, whether thats a friend, a pet, something you’ve got planned in the near future, or even just the feeling of the sun on your skin. Anything to get you through each day. You never have know when your life could take a turn for the best, or if something amazing will happen; and all of these things you will never get to experience if you end it all now. I’m not here to say that you shouldn’t do it, because at the end of the day, I’m just some stranger on the internet that you don’t know. But what I do know is that things can always get better. Always. But you never know when; and you’ll never know if you’re not here.",RedandBlue912,14,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/fcuzx0/a_story_to_hopefully_bring_you_back_from_the/,hi know help help even one person enough bit back ground information 22 year old ha suffering severe depression past year suicidal thought everyday every hour felt like wa already dead cause one seemed notice wa slowly wasting away inside also began hear voice would constantly berate tell kill sought help gp wa put onto anti depressant sertraline absolutely nothing make worse certainly make better wa put onto another anti depressant mirtazapine started taking beginning february 2020 seemed help energy finally get bed take shower leave house couple week ago noticed although energy get go daily life wa still thinking killing everyday time wa different energy motivation actually come detailed plan go scared much never felt urge kill much last couple week yesterday lot deal partner ha sick unknown illness nearly year parent rushed hospital wa absolute mess really struggling silence suicidal thought whilst also fulfilling duty carer partner mental breakdown took hospital voice stop actually began shouting back minute sobbing bathroom floor became completely numb decided follow plan grabbed supply involved dog lead made sure buy one especially occasion perfectly fit around neck sturdy metal clip could attach banister would hold weight wa ready wa ready go put collar around neck began push neck collar cut blood supply main artery neck heard would take minute make unconscious whole time wa holding dog close chest cause wa scared wanted die badly could feel going stopped know stopped part thought time go ended picking phone calling someone managed calm helped look everything different perspective know lot people say selfish feeling suicidal committing suicide due hurt would cause family friend etc felt yesterday none mattered truly believed wanted die stopped would probably dead morning partner finally got official diagnosis ha making ill currently sat hospital waiting come surgery told doctor going live healthy normal life operation killed yesterday afternoon would never gotten find partner wa going okay would never get marry april would never get see healthy happy thing would never known wa dead look forward able spend time partner start enjoy life try enjoy mine much knowing around long time trying get long story sort hope cling onto whether thats friend pet something got planned near future even feeling sun skin anything get day never know life could take turn best something amazing happen thing never get experience end say end day stranger internet know know thing always get better always never know never know,story hopefully bring back brink suicide,red blue 912

I dont want to die. I dont want to keep breathing.,"I use to drink often, I stopped. I'm very intoxicated so I might be all over. Shit happens right. 

I've been depressed for so fucking long it hurts to think about. At 13, 16, 19 everyone says it'll get better. I'm 23 and nothing's gotten any better.

I had a 3 year relationship and she threw me to the curb. I had a 2 year relationship following (after a break from  the 1st, we only dated a year but were close/fuck buddies for a year leading to it) and we broke up tonight, fun fact we still live together until july. My depression doesn't stem from relationships, there's a plethora of things contributing to it. I think I'm out of my depth on this one. We were fuck buddies because I didn't want another relationship. I didn't want to give someone a chance to hurt me again. 

She was moving for school and I couldn't bare the thought of losing her so I asked her to date and we planned and did move in together.
I've punched myself in the face because it's less damaging then cutting myself. I think at this point if I self harm it'll be the end. I promised myself that long ago though I didn't follow through the last time I started cutting myself. This time I think I would, one  pump of adrenaline is all it would take then I wouldn't be hurt anymore. 

I left all my friends for her, I moved an hour away for her. I dont see a point in living, I dont see a point in eating or sleeping. 

I dont know what I'm expecting fro. This honestly, I have noone but my sister and I hate being a burden on her (though tonight she may have kept me here). I know how I'd do it, it would be a 10 minute trip to get what I need. I dont want to but I have nothing and noone. No friends, out.of my family only my nana and sister talk to me. I've texted my dad yesterday and today about a car issue and that's the most we've talked in 2 days than I can remember. Usually it's around 1 a month, sometimes more sometimes less.

I'm a burden on everyone. I think the world would be a better place. All I can think about is putting a knife against my throat and givin' er. 

Relationships didn't cause this, certainly attributed. No friends, no family, noone to hurt if I die. I dont know what I was hoping to accomplish with this post but I think its pushed me farther towards doing it.

I hope you have a good day, thanks for taking a few minutes to read my messy/suicidal thoughts.

Maintaining Relationships with People,"Hello!

First of all, I really appreciate that you are taking the time to read my post and whether you were able to provide me with advice or not, thank you!

I feel like in order to give a better understanding of my situation, I need to talk about what I've gone through (I'm sorry that it end being a very long post)

When I was a kid, I was pretty much normal and had my group of friends but I used to be very shy and faced a lot of verbal abuse at that time but kept quite and thought it was a normal and ok thing, it didn't affect me though very much because of that. However in middle school, I've experienced trauma that changed me forever and left a very deep scar on me emotionally that took me years to overcome because no one tried to help, those who see me went through it and those who I spoke to about it didn't try to help. For years I had trust issues and was paranoid most of the time, it was my first experience of feeling alone and that no one understands me, and slowly I started to drift away and shut myself out, I just wanted to be alone and because of that I started to lose friends but I didn't care at that time, I thought I was doing the right thing by avoiding as much social interaction as possible. I guess in a way I was trying to protect myself.

The years after that, I've tried to regain my social life back and make friends again, I tried everything that I can from trying to act as a happy and funny person cause no one wants to see the real me, my depressing and sad self who wants to make friends with such a person? and when it actually works out, I thought I was doing the right thing but it ends up making me more depressed cause it takes me a lot of effort to be ""that person"" and I really didn't felt like I'm making any deep connection with anyone so I was like screw it, I'll just be myself by which I mean that I will not try anything to be forcefully liked by others and I thought since I'm into so many things, I will probably find someone who is into one of these things and be friends with but that didn't work out either. I kinda became that extra friend in a group that her existence or not didn't make any difference or that friend who you come to when your other friends are not around or that person you hang out not because you enjoy their company but you just don't want to be sitting alone. That messed me up in my senior year of high school, I felt like shit and I spent most of the time during the break in the toilet cause I rather that than feeling like shit when I am with others. And just to be clear, they are not awful people and they didn't say anything bad to me, it's just I've been friends with them for so long and whether at that time when I was trying to be the funny and happy person or myself, either way, I never felt I belong or that anyone cared, I felt I was just someone they knew and sure why not they can call a ""friend"".

In college though is where my struggle peaked, all those friendships that I made in high school are slowly disappearing everyone was moving on with their lives and I guess that means leaving unwanted relationships behind but regardless I did what I thought was right and did my part. I've reached out to them but it always ends up a one-sided relationship with everyone apparently and no one will reach out to me if I don't so I stopped. There was this one person I was close to during my school years and I tried to be the friend she can rely on in time of needs and depend on, I wanted to be always there for her but she never makes time for me but somehow she can with others so I tried to put ""our friendship"" to the test and just respond coldly to her messages just to see if she will ask what's wrong, I want her to notice that there was a problem and see if she gonna care about our friendship but she ends up unfollowing me in social media and blocked me out of her life that simply even though she perfectly knows me too well and knows that this is not my kind of behavior.

I had no problem talking with strangers, I can open a conversation and interact with anyone easily so trying to get to know people in college was not difficult except I don't think anyone wanted to be my friend, I just remain their classmate. I end up making just one friend in college, we had a lot in common and I really believed it could work out but it took a lot of ignoring of her frustrating attitude which sometimes makes me wonder if she will bother to hold on to me if I ever show my frustration. At some point, I've gone through a deep depression that made me very suicidal and thought there was no future for me but I was trying to hold on to hope and as much I want to act tough and act like I can handle this I couldn't, I really just need someone to talk to and so far as you can see I had no one except this college friend and I didn't know how it will go but thought let's give it a try so I opened up to her and after when I was done, the conversation didn't last for 2 minutes and I was so crushed because sure maybe she was not the perfect person to open up to but at that time I didn't have any option and I just really needed someone in my life to talk to. I really thought I'm gonna do it on that day cause I really lost hope.

As of now, it feels like I'm back at the starting point. I probably sound very awfully pathetic person or stupid to you. Every time when I'm not able to maintain any relationship in my life, I asked myself what's wrong with me? what have I done wrong in my life? I realized after a while that I try to fix things so hard in my life that I end up breaking it or damaging it but I always thought I was doing the right thing and doing my part by reaching out or helping out but somehow it doesn't make things better. It always seems that I'm the one making the effort and if you didn't notice, throughout those stages of my life that I mentioned no one tried to be my friend or wanted to but I've always seemed to be the one who wants to be someone's friend. Right now, I'm very much confused about what exactly I'm supposed to do. I just don't understand why I'm struggling so much to find somewhere I belong, I feel very much rejected no matter what I do. If I make an effort or not I end up alone either way. Everyone in my life seems to give up on me and no one bothers to hold on to me. I just don't know if I'm supposed to give up and just accept the fact that maybe this is how things supposed to be in my life.

Is suicide worth it?,"Hi, I'm 15 years old. Currently been pulled out of school,due to many reasons, which is why I'm here so that I can clear my mind of any other thoughts that may lead me to things that I might regret later on. I'd like to share first my story so that no one would come at me.(ex. You're just 15, its just a phase. Pls stop doing this to get attention.etc) when I was very young I didn't really paid any attention whenever my father and mother would fought or when my sister( the 2nd oldest) would always ignore or would get pissed at me, because I thought that it was the norm. But things got worse when the whole family fought because of the sh*tty things my father had done and it all started because of me drinking a godd*mn cola, it went like this: ""who drank the cola?"" My father asked I was very scared so I didn't replied he asked that again and again until my mother told my father off, until they just started to shout at each other which forced my eldest sister to butt in, and the whole thing went to what my father did, such as adultery and abuse. So it lead to my father pushing my mother, which pushed my sisters to fight my father, physically. I couldn't do anything but it really shocked me, and blamed myself for it. After the whole ordeal, it took 5 months to mend back the family. I thought finally, but I still had other problemsto face. I know that its stereotypical of me to say this but my asian parents(filipino) would always forced me to study when I never wanted any of this, I just wanted to play with other kids with no care in the world but I couldn't. My mothers way of teaching really left a toll on me cuz she would just hit me whenever I get the wrong answer or if I couldn't reply with the correct answer. I've always been the 2nd honor roll, but when she said this to me on the way back home ""pls don't drop your grades it would be really embarassing to my friends if you did"" that was jusy painful for me. others may think that I'm overreacting it was still really painful, tho I still couldn't speak my mind, I continued still, I was getting bullied as well for no reason. Years went by I was already in my first year of highschool in a prestige academy. I made friends, been respected, and I had little bumps in my grades but I still felt really great. Then one day one of my friends who is a guy told me to hang out with him, I couldn't tell that he had malicious intents. I was just really stupid. He cornered me ""can i touch your boobs?"" He said, I was shocked and refused but he was really strong and managed to touched me and resorted to attempted rape, afte I broke free, crying and running in the same day. I couldn't tell anyone nor my parent. So I just cried the whole night and proceeded to go to school and bearing to be with him in the same class. I had finally mustered up the courage to tell the guidance councelor, and due to that he got expelled and words got out because of the things he did and so I got harassed even more with the guys but I couldn't do anything and told myself to bear with it. I now entered my 2nd year of highschool which started the changes with me I became more irritated, a hot mess. I've been disrespectful to my mom, the reason we fight every morning. And another problem rosed up. A mistress of my father contacted me, I knew that she was just messing with me but I felt so angry. So I told my guidance counselor because I didn't know what to do anymore, so she told my mom and filed a case to my dads mistress, but the case got dropped because they said the account iwas fake when clearly it wasn't, I know I'm no professional but it was pretty obvious that it wasn't fake. I got even more mad because my mom didn't mind and told me it must be  Gods plan (I'm christian but I'm not really on how my mother believes)now things really went downhill for me.I couldn't eat, I couldn't think of happy thoughts, I  would just think of nothing, or everything is just useless even humanity, and that I wished I could just sleep and die from it. Things got even worse because my sister(the 2nd eldest), whenever I tell her shes wrong she would get mad at me,whenever I got mad at her she would get made at me, even tho she was in the wrong, but she was too prideful and wouldn't say sorry but I still did anyway. When things got even more hectic I started to hurt myself, my mom knew and told me angrily that I did it because of the internet. I couldn't take it anymore everything that I do is wrong,  its like I'm the misfortune. I wanted to kill myself, which is why I went to the guidance counselor, and told my mom everything, so she pulled me out of school, and appointed me to a psychiatrist but the medicines was too much for me, in short it was painful, and it makes me go insane for some reason, and even messed with my diet(made me eat more). So my mom stopped me from drinking the pills, but the withdrawal was sh*tty too. I still get mad at everything and I really want to kill myself. I mean I don't know I'm still thinking of the pros and cons of me killing myself. Its just that I wish in my sleep someone would kill me. But I really wanna know if suicide is worth a shot, because I regret everything and I'm desperate( this isn't the whole thing sthst happened but its getting long that it)",jasmineazuu,10,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/fcxkhb/is_suicide_worth_it/,hi 15 year old currently pulled school due many reason clear mind thought may lead thing might regret later like share first story one would come ex 15 phase pls stop get attention etc wa young really paid attention whenever father mother would fought sister 2nd oldest would always ignore would get pissed thought wa norm thing got worse whole family fought sh tty thing father done started drinking godd mn cola went like drank cola father asked wa scared replied asked mother told father started shout forced eldest sister butt whole thing went father adultery abuse lead father pushing mother pushed sister fight father physically anything really shocked blamed whole ordeal took 5 month mend back family thought finally still problemsto face know stereotypical say asian parent filipino would always forced study never wanted wanted play kid care world mother way teaching really left toll cuz would hit whenever get wrong answer reply correct answer always 2nd honor roll said way back home pls drop grade would really embarassing friend wa jusy painful others may think overreacting wa still really painful tho still speak mind continued still wa getting bullied well reason year went wa already first year highschool prestige academy made friend respected little bump grade still felt really great one day one friend guy told hang tell malicious intent wa really stupid cornered touch boob said wa shocked refused wa really strong managed touched resorted attempted rape afte broke free cry running day tell anyone parent cried whole night proceeded go school bearing class finally mustered courage tell guidance councelor due got expelled word got thing got harassed even guy anything told bear entered 2nd year highschool started change became irritated hot mess disrespectful mom reason fight every morning another problem rosed mistress father contacted knew wa messing felt angry told guidance counselor know anymore told mom filed case dad mistress case got dropped said account iwas fake clearly know professional wa pretty obvious fake got even mad mom mind told must god plan christian really mother belief thing really went downhill eat think happy thought would think nothing everything useless even humanity wished could sleep die thing got even worse sister 2nd eldest whenever tell shes wrong would get mad whenever got mad would get made even tho wa wrong wa prideful say sorry still anyway thing got even hectic started hurt mom knew told angrily internet take anymore everything wrong like misfortune wanted kill went guidance counselor told mom everything pulled school appointed psychiatrist medicine wa much short wa painful make go insane reason even messed diet made eat mom stopped drinking pill withdrawal wa sh tty still get mad everything really want kill mean know still thinking pro con killing wish sleep someone would kill really wanna know suicide worth shot regret everything desperate whole thing sthst happened getting long,suicide worth,jasmine zu u
how r ppl this clueless,"Today I got brave enough to tell my mom I’m not okay and that I need to go to the hospital. I told her last year that I tried to die when she found my suicide notebook and saw my SH marks on my arm. I haven’t been going to school and she sees me cry almost everyday. But when I told her she said “what made you think like that” and “you can’t think like that”. I said we need to go to the hospital idk what’s going to happen tonight. She said why would I go to the hospital and for what reason, like she doesn’t know. I told her never mind and she just moved on like it was nothing. Like her daughter is nothing. 

I also told my dad today, but all he could ass was “why would u feel the NEED to think like that” and asked me a bunch of questions as if it’s my fault I’m depressed and want to die. 

My friends know that I go through depressive moods and the first time they cared but by now, they don’t even bother to check up on me. 

I’ve been trying to get better by myself but I can’t do it. I stopped SH but that doesn’t make the thought go away. I’m just so tired and alone.

I don’t want to kill myself,"I don’t want to die this way, but i think i inevitably will, no one can save me from myself. Everyday takes so much effort to function mediocrely. I want to live but I don’t think I can change. It’s just a waiting game. I’m not depressed enough to want to act on my thoughts, I’m too scared and I care too much about the people around me. I just want to die and take everyone’s suffering with me. I want everyone to be happy because they deserve that. I wish there was a way I could sacrifice myself and make everyone better. I’ve had enough of suffering, I can’t bear to see it. I feel empathy so hard, because of the severe depressive episode I went through a few years ago. I can’t bear to imagine anyone experiencing that. It breaks my heart. I convinced myself not to die but I’ve never truly felt at peace, life for me is just exhausting attempts at constantly distracting myself from the depressive thoughts that I just can’t get rid off. I’ve learnt how to cope, but I’ve never been cured.

i dont even know what to title this,"i think i saw myself in the tub five times this whole day so far and its only 4pm. i care for the people around me very deeply and just the thought of them being devastated when i leave makes me even more depressed. i deal with all of this all by myself as everybody does. i feel bad because everyone eventually leaves me after realizing how difficult my situation is and how draining it can be to deal with it. i guess you can say i’m a big ass burden.

i’m not the best worker. i’m incredibly lazy. not because i choose to have fun, but because i don’t feel good enough. my motivation to do anything is at a 0. another factor of why is i never know what i want to do. my upbringing wasn’t great and i was always constantly thrown off course from the things i really wanted to do to cater to people who didn’t care to see me happy. now i’m kinda doing my own shit without being asked, but it took me almost a year to learn how to think for myself. all thanks to my current partner though.

i’m starting to lose hope though. although i do have people i care for, i’m afraid of telling them how i feel beyond just “i’m depressed.” i know it makes the people around me really sad and sometimes suicidal themselves. so i stay quiet of the actual extent of how bad it can be. and because of my job, its hard to make friends. i can’t even tell people about what i do. do you know how lonely it gets? having to bottle everything up but too afraid to tell people how its just eating me up slowly. i was doing well for a second with my job and then last week, i spent the whole time all burnt out, crying nonstop just by myself. i but because of my condition and how it’s affecting me, i’m losing the one person who was able to get me to be productive and ignore my feelings. people are gonna comment and say “don’t ignore your feelings,” but i’m tired of having it impede my progress. and i know if they leave, i’ll go back to how i was; not doing anything and just laying all curled up in a ball just waiting for death to come naturally.

now i feel like i should just end it to avoid all of this. i’m too much of a burden. i just want them to be happy.

And I am fucking FED UP with people telling me it will get better,"It will get better for you, the person with more than a handful of friends worried for you and asking if you'll be okay, the person who actually has a significant other who you can always turn to, the person who has a community that accepts them and doesn't discriminate against them for their entire identity. The person who only has depression and not a literal learning disability that impacts how you interact with others, and they treat you horribly because of it. The person who's pretty or at least average looking but at least they don't have a disfigured face people avoid as soon as they see you.

If you're all of those. Or at least one. It'll always get better for you. And I am none of these!

So I don't want to hear ""life will get better"" because it fails to take account to the people who have nothing and who's been like this for years. That's me!!

Nothing,"I've lost the fight.

I'm nothing at this point. A ball of emotions, barely fucking human. I've lost my motivation to go on. I'm not even pushing back against the destruction my brain wrecks. I'm not special, unique, important, smart, helpful, or human in any sense. I'm a selfish, lying bastard piece of shit. I'm insignificant, the background man. I'm not who I am. I'm a fake. A fake built up to conceal the blackness and horrible person I really am. I can't be happy ever again, everything I put on is just a mask to hide the nothingness. 

Nobody needs me. I don't have a life to take at this point. I'm numb, and I can't feel it anymore. I'm tired of waiting, fighting, disguising, and trying. I'm losing, and there's nothing I can do to win.

I want to genuinely kill myself after this incident. How will I ever recover.,"I know. This makes me sound like a HORRIBLE PERSON. I meant to send the text to my brother about my friend but I checked the sender (after I got all my aggression and sadness/anger/frustration out through text) and it turns out the recipient wasn’t my brother...it was my friend. I feel like my world is going to end. I quickly deleted it all as fast as I could, but she had still seen it all...or most of it, and that is enough. Me and this girl have been friend for my whole life. I am 16 and she is 17. As soon as I realized that I made a huge mistake, I started shaking frantically and my heart almost beat out of my chest. The more I look at this situation, the less my friend is in the wrong, and the more I am in the wrong. After this incident happened with me frantically typing away and sending horrible texts about her in front of her face, I couldn’t even say anything. I was mortified. I I sent the texts (it turned out she had already seen them at this point) and simply walked away. I didn’t know what to say. I seriously just took out all of my aggression on one of my best friends, over text, in front of her. And won’t get into what the texts said too much, but basically they were saying: “ she always thinks she’s better than me, and always makes me feel bad” and so forth. And guess what...I started the whole schpiel off by typing: “ *blank* is so annoying. I got so scared and angry at myself afterwards that I threw up in the bathroom and cut my wrist. I deserved it. I went home early , to filled with guilt and too ashamed to continue on throughout the day, and now here I lye, writing this on reddit in my bed, hoping someone could share some advice. Also, I already tried messaging her saying, : “I know you saw what I sent you...and I’m so sorry” and so forth. In these texts of me apologizing, I wrote how some of the things i said about her were true, and tht I was really sad latley and depressed(I never talk about things like this with her, EVER because I’ve seen how she handles those types of situations....she simply cuts people off if they are feeling suicidal or sad.

am I suicidal?,"hi. I'm not sure if this is one of those things where if you have to ask it then there is a definite answer, but I'm not sure if what I experience is truly suicidal thoughts.

when I don't feel sad I become very thankful and when I try to express to God thanks for what he has given me, I feel guilty for spending my time self harming or being self destructive. I feel I'll never be able to truly convey how thankful I am for what he's given me and I'm back to square one, just wishing I was never born so I wouldn't have these thoughts and emotions.

I don't really care about anything and many of my thoughts are just wishing I could disappear or wishing I was ""less"" in every possible way. I want to not be alive so I don't feel the emotions I feel. I do not often contemplate different ways to kill myself, it is moreso just wishing I wasn't born in the first place or hoping someday something else will happen to me that makes this decision for me.

the majority of my thoughts are wishing I was dead or never born, and even when I'm happy I just wish I could stop feeling and the answer to that to me is death. is the way I'm feeling considered suicidal?

i will never be me, not truly, nature saw to that, its a cruel thing what i am, to feel and associate with something im not even close to being, the pain of not being it, if i ever had a choise i would never feel this pain from it, but it never was my choise this pain of not being the woman i feel i am inside that burden came to me, i no longer know how or what i am, all i know is that im defective, thats how i see myself at least.

i`ll be sad to see it all gone, and i wish i had the strength to stay, but i no longer do, thats the complete truth

I'm also struggling morally with allowing him to go through with it.

I’m hesitant to post because I don’t think my thoughts/fears/etc are worthy of anyone’s time.,"Feel free to downvote me into oblivion or to just move on. 

I just can’t do it myself. I want to die. In fact, I can’t actually envision a future for myself. The way some people see themselves getting married, having a career they love, having children, etc., I just don’t see that for myself. Instead, I only see myself dead. Sadly, I don’t have the strength or fortitude to end my own life. I have a plan for ending it all, but I just don’t think I could actually follow through with it. 

I have a fear of commitment, and committing to that decision is something I just can’t do. Several times everyday, I daydream about someone walking up to me and killing me. If someone else did it for me, it would make things so much better. Ironically, this makes me want to self harm, but self harming itself has left me with scars that make me feel worse about myself which, in turn, makes me want to end my life or self harm more.

Tonight is the night and I hate myself for it,"I am in the worst situation I have ever been in as I am about to become homeless. I returned to the UK after living abroad 5 months ago and things seemed promising at first however things went downhill pretty quickly. Finding a job has been a nightmare - i have decent experience and have had a lot of interviews but everywhere either ghosts me or rejects me. I get rejected a lot because I ""dont show I want the job enough"" but years of BPD and depression mean I find it incredibly hard to show my emotions. One company rejected me for this reason after 4 rounds of interviews!

On top of that, I was with a gambling addict a few years ago who made my life hell and created all kinds of debt for me (signing up to websites with my details, getting loans out in my name). Completely my fault for sticking with him so long but he has left me with £12,000 approx worth of debt so of course I am being chased on those debts too. I am also not entitled to any benefits. 

So finally I have ran out of money and am 2 months behind on rent, I let my rental company know today and was pretty honest about my circumstances (I said it was because of redundancy as it's less embarrassing). We agreed I will move out this week, not that I was expecting any sympathy but the lady at the rental company was a dick. So now I am homeless - I am not pregnant or super young or super old or anything like that so the chances of me getting any help are pretty much zilch. 

I am leaving behind the most amazing boyfriend that I never thought I would find and that's why there is so much guilt. I think deep down I am leaving this message in the hope one day he sees it and knows there is nothing he could have done. I have tried talking to him about this but he thinks I am just having a BPD episode and am exaggerating. There is no way he can help anyway he certainly couldn't help me financially (nor would I expect him to!) and he lives in the same house so staying with him isn't an option.

you mean more than you know,"ive been clean from heroine for 2 weeks, and even since the unbearable pain of withdrawals have passed, the mental emptiness has not, and might not for a very long time. like many of you, i still think about ending my life every day. 

2 days ago, i was out on my porch, writing a suicide note. seemingly, getting the last rays of sunshine i would ever feel. I was content with that. Then, I heard my phone ringing. Who the hell is calling me on my last day here. 

My best friends twin sister had been diagnosed with Leukemia. Think about your BEST friend, and how their pain, is often yours, as well. I mean, why wasn't I already on my way to grab my car keys and see him and his family? 

After a few grief-stricken hours spent with them, I headed back home. Then, I realized; for a whole two hours, did I really just forget about fucking killing myself?

The one thing that took me out of my thoughts of death were simply thoughts about someone else. And it helped me realize why I ended things with heroine, and not with my life. 

I'm not one to know whether it is healthy or not to love someone more than you love yourself. All I know, is that a phone call from my best friend stopped me from killing myself. The circumstances of why he called me reminded me of the importance of me still being alive. Anyone who has experienced something like this, I encourage you to not see these instances as coincidences, but as testaments to the fact that you are meant to still be alive.

I don't really know how to wrap this up. I just hope you all know how much you really matter. Because now, I remember how much I matter. I know this won't help everybody, but I hope it will help somebody.

The only person who can make me better is myself and I can’t do that,"TLDR: only I can make myself happy again and I know for a fact I’ll never do that, I’m hopeless

———

I’m only making myself feel worse because I have so many things to do and I’m not doing any of them because I’m lazy and want to lie in bed all day. Then the stress of it all just builds up and the stress paralyzes me into inaction even more and then more stress piles up and so on

I’m digging myself a hole, I’m making myself worse off and ruining my own life

And at the end of the day it’s up to me to fix myself. It’s up to me to get things done and to get my life in order, to make myself happy again

But I know for a fact I can’t do that. I’m too lazy, too tired, can’t focus on anything or anyone other than myself. I’m pathetic 

I’ll never be able to find the will to fix myself so why am I even still here? Just to stay miserable until I inevitably kill myself down the road because I’m incapable of helping myself

Nothing will ever be able to fix me. It’s all up to me. It’s up to me and that’s scary because I’ll never be able to help myself. I can’t, I know for a fact I can’t and I won’t 

I’m wasting so many peoples time by reaching out because I don’t believe a single kind word they say and don’t follow any of their advice because I’m too lazy to try

I’ve still never told anyone about that, i was hoping to fall asleep and never wake up.

I'm constantly euphoric, spontaneous feeling of deep rage and an impulse to punch and scream. On top of that, being ticked off by little things and become explosive. 

If the price to pay to not feel worried all the time is explosive behaviour Id rather take the other. I have recurred to smoking to calm myself. Right now Im a step away of losing control over and really lose myself go in a blind beastly rage.

"I feel so lost and tired, so I'm writing it all out to make myself feel better a bit.","These days I just feel like running around in circles. I keep making the wrong decisions, all of which coming from my inability to control my emotions. I am currently facing the consequences of my decisions and of course, am very tired as I could not see any way for me to feel accomplished. Additionally, I have imposed problems upon others, including my loved ones. It all began so well. I was in this perfect mint condition of being an average student from a prestigious high school in my country. The school's full of brilliant kids I can't seem to catch up with, and once I feel exhausted to keep on competing with them academically for scholarships, I stopped trying. My mom was having a perfectly stable job, earning an equivalent of 500 USD each month. Yet, the toxic environmental conditions of the city we lived in back then made me feel really oppressed, not to mention I was absurdly overwhelmed by the isolated feeling the school gave me. 

That was when I decided to stupidly leave my country for another place that seemed more ideal - a country in Europe, with inarguably better climate (because I love cold weather), better food quality, generally peaceful urban life in contrast to the busy city ruled by crazy drivers. It felt great for the first few days of arrival and my head was temporarily free from all the pressure, but all magic comes with a price. 

Basic things in life such as water are ridiculously expensive here - it's stressful to think about it in the shower. Additionally, I've moved to a new school. What made me so reluctant about it was the fact that it's an international school: small but sweet community, but with tuition fees that have considerably stressed my mom out. The prices are equivalent of what my mother made in her old job in 2 years. Life was good until Coronavirus struck. Apparently, healthcare in Europe is downright FRUSTRATING. (sorry European friends) Few countries took the quarantine procedure seriously, and the country I'm living in now isn't one of them. I want to go back...

Days went by and I discovered that lots of kids in my old school are currently achieving something. Something that I once considered to be my dream, but had given up on it just because.....emotions. 

Ughh I don't know anymore... I'm so stressed atm I don't even know what I'm saying anymore.

I have cut a few slashes to my arm once, though not noticeable, and very much want to do the same again. I have so much to think about. I feel guilty for putting someone like my mom to go through things so I could get what I wanted.

I can't do it anymore.,"Hi.  I'd rather not say my name, but I'm 15 and I've been like this since I was 11.  I don't want to do anything anymore.  Everything just seems... boring.  I'm quite sick of everyday repetition.  Wake up, eat, go to school, come home, eat again, then sleep.  I've lost interest in all the games I thought were interesting before.  Now it's just as dull as a pencil that hasn't been sharpened in a couple years.  I don't want to do it anymore.  My grades are dropping like the downwards part of a roller coaster.  I hate everyone and everything.  I hate them because they are disgusting.  I hate them because they are annoying.  I hate them because they do nothing to help.  Everyone doesn't like me.  They only tolerate me.  They like to pick on me since I'm like this.  They think it's funny if someone is a failure.  Failures like me are disgraceful to everyone.  I can't do anything right.  I get yelled at by my mother for the smallest of things.  I have religious propaganda pushed on to me everyday and it doesn't stop.  I just need space.  I want to feel the same spark of interest I felt when I was a little kid.  Everyone thinks that I'm doing okay when they can clearly see that I'm internally suffering.  I don't want to live anymore.  Life was okay.  Life was great.  Hell, I'd even say that life was the best thing that happened to me.  But life just started going downhill and it's still going lower and lower than it was before.  If I killed myself all of my problems would go away.  Everyone couldn't bother me anymore.  Everything would be peaceful.  I'd all be okay.  I can't do it anymore.  Everything is too stressful to deal with.  I don't want to put up with this life anymore.  It already sucks enough as it is.  So why not just end it.  I guess I'll just finish the things I had planned first.  I just want things to be okay but they aren't going to be.  If anyone wants to help me go ahead.

Am I being a burden on my family?,"I'm 16 F diagnosed with depression. I'm thinking of killing myself tonight. Tried yesterday, failed. One of reason behind this is that I'm being burden on my family. I don't have mental capacity to think clearly. So I'm asking you. 

Dropped this year boards because I wasn't able to study at all. Its near beginning to next session, and I haven't recovered a bit. Because my parents this is happening because of some sort of supernatural evil thing. After diagnosis they didn't took me to therapy ever again. Rather they took me to get rid of that evil thing. I'm not gonna be able to to study and waste all their money again. They also have to give dowry for my marriage and pay for my education. And waste my life, and their money. We have financial problems too.

I think it's justified to commit suicide.

But what if ruin their mental health.

My mom had BPD, and schizophrenia. My sister is 10. I think this will ruin their life. But we aren't close emotionally. They might also be better without me.

My reality is mess, I think I can never recover, and waste my life, and live like this for 60 years, which is so scary. My mom doesn't go to a doctor because she thinks this is because of that evil thing. I'm scared for her. She doesn't eat because she thinks her enemy is gonna kill her if she does so. No matter how much we insist to take her to a doctor, she refused.

I'm stuck.

I deserve to die,"I'm 22 years old. And unlike most of the people here, I truly deserve to kill myself.

I've been verbally and physically abusive to everyone around me since I could talk. 

So far as humans go. I bullied kids when I was a kid. Lots of kids. I was never nice to anyone. I was mean to my parents. I hit. I beat up one of my friends. As an adult, I've been physically and verbally abusive to my mom. I've left her with black eyes. And my stepdad. I've told them both to kill themselves a million times. I've said some truly awful things. Not just to them. I lost a friend after I verbally abused her, too. And I've treated my best friend horribly.

Worse than that, the animals. Both of the first cats I ever had ran away, so I must have done something to them. The third, I chased her around and sprayed her with water and hit her. For years. She was traumatized. She hated me. She'd always scratch me up and I deserved it. The fifth cat ran away, I don't know what I did. The sixth cat I don't remember if I was mean or nice but I gave her to some old ladies because we had to move. I hope they loved her. My seventh cat is my current cat. I got her right before I turned twelve. I used to put a laundry basket over her and shake it while she screamed. She was just a little kitten. I stopped doing that at some point because my mom talked to me. But I hit her. Sometimes multiple times. This cat isn't traumatized mostly. She cuddles me every fucking night that I let her. But...

Then there's my dogs. I beat the shit out of my older dog, multiple times when I was an older teen. I beat him with shoes because he chewed them. He was just sad I had to go to school and I beat him. My younger dog I beat the shit out of once (maybe, technically, twice? same day in a short time period), ever. 1,264 days ago. I was so gutted about how badly I hurt him-- he was bruised under his fur and upset for days-- I swore never to beat any animal ever again, and I haven't. But I still hit them. I'm ""extremely abusive"". That's how my grandma describes me. My fucking grandma. (The dogs aren't traumatized at all anymore, but...)

I also ripped off a lizard's tail...and killed a lizard...but those were accidents. 

On top of all that, it's quite possible I'm a pedophile. When I was 14, I chased an 11 year old girl around trying to kiss her. (I succeeded. This happened 2x.) And when I was 19, I read 2 fanfiction about a sexual relationship between a 16 year old and a 12 year old. And I had dreams for years about rape? Of children? I mean, I also have OCD and it could just be that. But one day I abruptly decided that That Wasn't Going To Happen Anymore, and now it happens much less. It's unpleasant. 

I don't want to be like this. I don't want to be abusive to anyone. I was never abused. I recently started therapy (again). I'm on medication (Paxil). I think about the abuse all the time. It's probably 80% of my thoughts. I am trying to not do these things. To never be verbally or physically abusive again. I love my family and my pets and they have never deserved this. But I will never be able to undo the things that I have done. Even if I try to make amends. Even if I'm forgiven, which I am. I am a bad person, and thanks to what I've done, I will always be.

I deserve every ounce of guilt I've felt these past 1,264 days that I've known I've abusive. These past years where I didn't try to change until now. I deserve to feel this way every miserable day for the rest of my life. I deserve to kill myself.",djdjhgmjk,3,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/fcvam7/i_deserve_to_die/,22 year old unlike people truly deserve kill verbally physically abusive everyone around since could talk far human go bullied kid wa kid lot kid wa never nice anyone wa mean parent hit beat one friend adult physically verbally abusive mom left black eye stepdad told kill million time said truly awful thing lost friend verbally abused treated best friend horribly worse animal first cat ever ran away must done something third chased around sprayed water hit year wa traumatized hated always scratch deserved fifth cat ran away know sixth cat remember wa mean nice gave old lady move hope loved seventh cat current cat got right turned twelve used put laundry basket shake screamed wa little kitten stopped point mom talked hit sometimes multiple time cat traumatized mostly cuddle every fucking night let dog beat shit older dog multiple time wa older teen beat shoe chewed wa sad go school beat younger dog beat shit maybe technically twice day short time period ever 1 264 day ago wa gutted badly hurt wa bruised fur upset day swore never beat animal ever still hit extremely abusive grandma describes fucking grandma dog traumatized anymore also ripped lizard tail killed lizard accident top quite possible pedophile wa 14 chased 11 year old girl around trying kiss succeeded happened 2x wa 19 read 2 fanfiction sexual relationship 16 year old 12 year old dream year rape child mean also ocd could one day abruptly decided going happen anymore happens much le unpleasant want like want abusive anyone wa never abused recently started therapy medication paxil think abuse time probably 80 thought trying thing never verbally physically abusive love family pet never deserved never able undo thing done even try make amends even forgiven bad person thanks done always deserve every ounce guilt felt past 1 264 day known abusive past year try change deserve feel way every miserable day rest life deserve kill,deserve die,dj dj hg jk

I’m tired.,"I’ve been feeling the exact same way for years. I get momentary feelings of happiness and then they just disappear. I have little to no energy anymore and I’m not excited to talk to anyone. I don’t think any of my friends care about me and I can’t depend on my family for any support. I’m on a waiting list for a mental health service but it’s going to take a while but I don’t know how long I can keep feeling like this.

I got my first job the other day and although I’ve met some nice people, I still feel like shit. My parents think I’m instantly cured because of the fact I’m now working but in truth I’m thinking about just ending it all. Nothing is going to change or help.

"afraid to die, but i dont want to live. please read all of this, i want to know if i am alone","I want to die, I want everything to stop and I want to stop my thoughts and my lungs. Every single breath hurts my body, it’s like I’m struggling to breathe even though it’s basic instinct. I self harm all of the time and recently I’ve done worse than I ever have before. My whole body aches and I’m constantly tired, I just don’t have energy for life anymore. I want to kill myself and be done with it, but theres so many things I need to work out. Who will find my body? How will I do it? Will it hurt? Who should I give my belongings and pets to? Anyway, I just want someone to listen to me and to talk to me about how I really feel. Everyone always brushes me off. Nobody listens to anything I say, I feel so alone. I’m not sure if I truly want to die or if I just want to hurt myself badly enough to be hospitalised for a few weeks. I’m scared to truly die, but is it strange to want to hurt myself and be hospitalised for a while? I want to take a break from my life and be somewhere with people who understand and will take care of me. I feel like the only way I’ll be able to escape is if I attempt suicide and am hospitalised, and they’ll finally have to take me seriously. Is this a crazy thought? Does anyone else feel this way?

Everything in my life has gone to shit but the only reasons I'm still here is my cats,"I'm 22. I grew up in an emotionally, verbally, and occasionally physically abusive home. My dad became an alcoholic as a result of the abuse from my mom. I became the unwilling referee and parental therapist as a preteen and eventual side punching bag as a teen. My mom has tried to kill me a few times now - some before I was 18, some after, and also kidnapped me as a child after she and my dad had a fight. I spent all of my adolescence waiting for a chance to get out. CPS came twice but nothing ever helped. I got into a dream school and everything as a senior, but that got ripped away too. Mom refused to sign off on loans - which I could not get without a co-signer. There went my escape. 

They divorced. I became the physical punching bag for my mom. I cut my hair off to prevent her from grabbing it. My dad got worse. I tried to kill myself a few times, all of which failed for some reason or another. Got 51/50'd. My mom proceeded to use that as a threat from then on of where she could send me if I didn't behave. I stayed with my dad after that, and cut her off. Still was depressed as fuck though. Only person I could talk to about any of it was my grandma. One night talked to her and my aunt (who's racist and hates me) happened to also be there. She took the phone and screamed at me. Told me never to call my grandma again, told me to stop making up shit about my family and stop talking suicide to an elder. My grandma could handle it, she used to feel that way too - it's why I could talk to her about it. 

Fast forward a little bit and my dad (just after we finally patched our relationship and things looked better) suddenly died from his drinking problem. I had to go back to my mom because no other relative was an option. My mom immediately took it out on me, and I became terrified to even wake up. She tried to smother me to death, tried to choke me out with an aux cord, tried to shove me down the stairs, tried to push me out of a moving vehicle, etc. Yet every time blamed me. It was the worst year of my life, or so I thought. At least I had my grandma. She was depressed too, over losing her son, and because she was being abused by her daughter (the racist aunt). I was trying to help but it always got covered up somehow. Then exactly one year later, my grandma suddenly died. But she left me half her estate to protect myself, because she wanted me to move out and live near her. She was the only person left that wanted to help me. 

But then my aunt (the one from before) got hissy about the fact that her mom and I were closer than they ever were, and she lawyered up. She refused to give me a key, refused to give me the items my grandma specifically wanted me to have (because no proof), and informed me of the sale well after it happened while I was out of state. She also kept going through my mom, which was idiotic - as my parents divorced and I was an adult. I asked her about it, she dodged, so I wrote a letter. She never contacted me again for months, so I had to get an attorney (that I can't afford tbh) and we've been back and forth on that since. Now she's threatening to file the taxes under my name without my permission without my SSN so the IRS comes after me. All this over fucking recipe cards and a desk!  

I always think about wanting to end it, end the pain, end the inevitable suffering that always comes, but I can't. I can't leave my cats. I refuse to rehome, the word itself hurts me to even type or see. How could I do such a thing to my family? The only ones there for me? Anytime I cry they sit on me and purr or lick my face and one of them legit meows at me until i talk to her and she keeps meowing till i'm done and then snuggles. They are literally the closest to me and the only ones that keep me going. I just wish I could do something for them too (like find a new place to live, but I can't). My mom recently made credit cards under my name and maxed them out. Told me this just so ""I'd understand the position I'm in."" If anyone asks her she says it's just to help me build my credit. To which I'm sure is somewhat true, because she intends to sign my name off as a cosigner to a property she wants to buy. 

To her I've only ever been a means to an end. I just want out, I don't want to die. I want a place on my own with my cats, safe and sound. But I feel like I'll never get out. And I'm afraid to wish too because everytime I do I get something worse.",DesalinationByTheSun,0,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/fcy97r/everything_in_my_life_has_gone_to_shit_but_the/,22 grew emotionally verbally occasionally physically abusive home dad became alcoholic result abuse mom became unwilling referee parental therapist preteen eventual side punching bag teen mom ha tried kill time wa 18 also kidnapped child dad fight spent adolescence waiting chance get cps came twice nothing ever helped got dream school everything senior got ripped away mom refused sign loan could get without co signer went escape divorced became physical punching bag mom cut hair prevent grabbing dad got worse tried kill time failed reason another got 51 50 mom proceeded use threat could send behave stayed dad cut still wa depressed fuck though person could talk wa grandma one night talked aunt racist hate happened also took phone screamed told never call grandma told stop making shit family stop talking suicide elder grandma could handle used feel way could talk fast forward little bit dad finally patched relationship thing looked better suddenly died drinking problem go back mom relative wa option mom immediately took became terrified even wake tried smother death tried choke aux cord tried shove stair tried push moving vehicle etc yet every time blamed wa worst year life thought least grandma wa depressed losing son wa abused daughter racist aunt wa trying help always got covered somehow exactly one year later grandma suddenly died left half estate protect wanted move live near wa person left wanted help aunt one got hissy fact mom closer ever lawyered refused give key refused give item grandma specifically wanted proof informed sale well happened wa state also kept going mom wa idiotic parent divorced wa adult asked dodged wrote letter never contacted month get attorney afford tbh back forth since threatening file tax name without permission without ssn irs come fucking recipe card desk always think wanting end end pain end inevitable suffering always come leave cat refuse rehome word hurt even type see could thing family one anytime cry sit purr lick face one legit meow talk keep meowing till done snuggle literally closest one keep going wish could something like find new place live mom recently made credit card name maxed told understand position anyone asks say help build credit sure somewhat true intends sign name cosigner property want buy ever mean end want want die want place cat safe sound feel like never get afraid wish everytime get something worse,everything life ha gone shit reason still cat,desalination sun
I don’t care if it wins anymore,"People keep telling me that if I kill myself, then the depression will win the fight. Here’s the catch, they think I fucking care if it wins. I don’t give a shit anymore. I’m not even using a throwaway account because I don’t care about keeping it a secret. Why would I care if the depression wins? All I want is peace, and if it takes the depression winning over me to achieve that, then why should I care at all? I don’t.

I'm pretty sure I'm just overreacting,"Hi everyone. I'm really not even in the mood to do this, but I don't want to be alone now. I'm having a breakdown and considering suicide. I think I'm overreacting to something, but I don't want to be judged right now. Can I ask that there be little to no judgement towards me please? I'm not in the right here, but I just want peace.

&amp;#x200B;

So today, my boss of a year told me she's relocating me. She said it's because of my body odor. She talked to me in January about it and I told her I'm doing my best. She told me today I was doing better but today it's been ""the worse it's been since then.""

I'm absolutely devastated. I have depression and schizophrenia, but I still brush my hair, brush my teeth, use deodorant, and body spray. I don't shower often because I have bad memories of when I was younger, I had severe eczema, and my skin would burn and peel when water touched it. I'm terrified of showers now. 

I know I have a responsibility to take care of myself, but it's so hard when I'm TRYING but no one seems to care that I'm trying. I also know my boss has been stressed lately, but I feel like she forgot what I told her in January and is snapping at me.

She also just sent me an email.

"" In January we had conversation about hygiene one that I had been reluctant to have.  From that conversation I believed that you would rectify the situation. Over the the past few weeks hygiene has become an issue again.

I am not sure if I am able to assist you in figuring out how to go about resolving the problem. What I am sure of is that you are a great member of the team and I want you to continue to work in the office.""

I'm not even sure I want to be here anymore. I was feeling really good about myself today. I changed clothes, used deodorant and body spray, and brushed my hair for the first time in days. I'm also getting my first car tomorrow. I thought that I could have a week where I actually felt hopeful.

I know I'm overreacting, but I just feel horrible about myself. I called my dad crying and he told me it was my fault and that he isn't trying to ""hurt me"". I told him ""I shouldn't have even called anyone."" and hung up. 

I'm just really tired and considering overdosing when I clock out of work today. I have plenty of Zoloft, plenty of BuSpar, and one dose of hydrocodone. I just regret being here because I have my dog here with me on campus. I asked my dad to come and pick me up and he acted like I was asking him to move a mountain for me. Even though I pay for gas and food and bills. So I told him to wait until tomorrow, I just wouldn't go to work tomorrow.

I just really want to die because I feel so awful about myself. I feel like I'm not worthy of love. I feel like I'm not worthy of respect. I'm exhausted. I feel that it would be better if I was dead, so my boss wouldn't have to deal with me.",Vincebae,1,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/fd1mrm/im_pretty_sure_im_just_overreacting/,hi everyone really even mood want alone breakdown considering suicide think overreacting something want judged right ask little judgement towards please right want peace amp x200b today bos year told relocating said body odor talked january told best told today wa better today worse since absolutely devastated depression schizophrenia still brush hair brush teeth use deodorant body spray shower often bad memory wa younger severe eczema skin would burn peel water touched terrified shower know responsibility take care hard trying one seems care trying also know bos ha stressed lately feel like forgot told january snapping also sent email january conversation hygiene one reluctant conversation believed would rectify situation past week hygiene ha become issue sure able assist figuring go resolving problem sure great member team want continue work office even sure want anymore wa feeling really good today changed clothes used deodorant body spray brushed hair first time day also getting first car tomorrow thought could week actually felt hopeful know overreacting feel horrible called dad cry told wa fault trying hurt told even called anyone hung really tired considering overdosing clock work today plenty zoloft plenty buspar one dose hydrocodone regret dog campus asked dad come pick acted like wa asking move mountain even though pay gas food bill told wait tomorrow go work tomorrow really want die feel awful feel like worthy love feel like worthy respect exhausted feel would better wa dead bos deal,pretty sure overreacting,vince bae

Thats it,"So i failed my semester again for second time.
I always was the top grades on my class till i entered college and everything just fall .
Cant focus or study till i failed for first time in my life
And thats where i became depressed.
I was always that strange kid who dont think like a kid or play like them
I was just a smart kid who cant find a meaning for anything.
I wasnt sad but not that happy too .
Even when my dad died i felt nothing even so he tried to kill me twice but still did many good things to me .
I remember i only cried a little when i saw my sis crying really hard for him.
And then i became a depressed person after first year in college .
Going to uni was a hell for me
I just wanted to be alone and sleep forever.
Till recently i found the courage inside me to change my life 
I started nofap and started praying everyday and dieting .. deleted all video games and books or films i had.
Just to change my whole life and felt really good even so i had many faild attembs but tried to improve .
Now i got my grades and failed again..
I dont want to die now .. i finally found something i rly want to do. And want to improve my life
But unfortunally thats it for me
I know my mother gonna have like a heart attack if she saw my grades.. and me myself cant just live anymore.
I had enough of these empty feelings.
Its the 27th of this month
My last day.
Till then i will continue doing my ""life changing"" daily habbits and studying more than ever for last time to prove to myself i can do it like others before suiciding.

Parents don’t get it,"I’m 16 I’ve been severely suicidal since I was 10. When I was around 11 I slit my wrists and my parents walked in when I was bleeding out. They said they were ‘busy’ working and gave me antiseptic cream and bandaids instead of taking me to the hospital my dad walked in later that night and cried over me and basically called me selfish. No one ever talked about it again and I never received help. I’m now in 11th grade and school has never been worse I’ve already had 2 pretty serious breakdowns and I’m  only 6 weeks in. Through extensive online research I found some ‘painless’ suicide methods and purchased the drugs and blades necessary to pull it off. I almost did it the other night but I want to finalise some things first. My mum is gone so just now I went to my dad for a final plea for help and when I told him he said “it’s all in your head” “ the 
only thing you have is self pity” etc. I just know I’m going to end it all pretty soon, I’m not sure when but almost definitely soon.

Another name on the suicide list,"Well, good evening ladies and gentlemen. 

Tonight i'm going to kill myself. There is no 
hope or desire to continue breathing. Loneliness does not want or plan to get away from me and I have already tried everything to escape but i will always be alone. I do not seek attention, advice, or a savior. All I want is to say goodbye, at least, to strangers who, in the same way if they knew me, would reject me. I am an extremely disposable being.

I feel very calm and I would like to hope with the idea that, when I die, I will be much calmer, but I cannot. I really don't want to die, but my life has no solution. Nobody can help me.

school makes me feel suicidal. does anyone have the same experiences,"hi, id like some advice if that’s possible. i suffer from extreme anxiety due to environmental and emotional stressors. this makes it extremely difficult to physically sit down and complete schoolwork before the deadline. i also miss a lot of classes because i am scared of confrontation.

just yesterday i submitted a late essay assigned a few weeks back that was half assed and didn’t even meet the page number requirements. this just perpetuates the existing anxiety because now i have to face the teacher tomorrow morning and possibly be questioned about my quality of work. i have a 504 plan but the thought of asking for extensions or additional help makes me feel pathetic.

anxiety + depression + an untreated eating disorder has caused my grades to falter ever since the start of last year . i am a senior in high school and am deathly afraid of being deferred from the colleges that i have been accepted to. the fact that i can’t keep up with high school work suggests that ill fail at college too

i’ve started becoming suicidal due to this. body dysmorphia makes it difficult just to step outside of my house. i have no friends, i am lonely and comfort myself with food, which i usually throw up after. the only people willing to listen to me are adults who are paid to do so

i fear that other people view me as undisciplined and lazy, or just plain stupid. there is no evidence against these perspectives as i keep all of my mental struggles hidden. in reality i am investing all of my energy just to haul my ass out of bed in the morning and get through the day. my mom works long shifts to sustain me but i as her child have nothing to offer in return- no friends or partners to introduce her to, no academic success or improvement, etc. on top of that she has to schedule all of my psych and therapy appointments which is difficult for her as a parent. she’d be better off if i weren’t here to burden her. 

i have a bunch of upcoming psych appointments and have my fingers crossed to be prescribed medicine. maybe i’d sulk less on some zoloft? but i know this isn’t a way out at least not a permanent one. 

i am tired and want it all to end. i know better than to end my life over a situation i’ll be out of in a few months but i can’t stand the thought of dealing with this any longer.",polycephalie,1,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/fcwtp7/school_makes_me_feel_suicidal_does_anyone_have/,hi id like advice possible suffer extreme anxiety due environmental emotional stressor make extremely difficult physically sit complete schoolwork deadline also miss lot class scared confrontation yesterday submitted late essay assigned week back wa half assed even meet page number requirement perpetuates existing anxiety face teacher tomorrow morning possibly questioned quality work 504 plan thought asking extension additional help make feel pathetic anxiety depression untreated eating disorder ha caused grade falter ever since start last year senior high school deathly afraid deferred college accepted fact keep high school work suggests ill fail college started becoming suicidal due body dysmorphia make difficult step outside house friend lonely comfort food usually throw people willing listen adult paid fear people view undisciplined lazy plain stupid evidence perspective keep mental struggle hidden reality investing energy haul bed morning get day mom work long shift sustain child nothing offer return friend partner introduce academic success improvement etc top ha schedule psych therapy appointment difficult parent better burden bunch upcoming psych appointment finger crossed prescribed medicine maybe sulk le zoloft know way least permanent one tired want end know better end life situation month stand thought dealing longer,school make feel suicidal doe anyone experience,poly ce pha lie
What is stopping me?,"It is very frustrating to have the feeling of ""today shall be the day"" and have every single little detail planned out and yet, it is suddenly so hard to execute it. 

So many fucking times I have held the knife over my wrist, had ropes tied to the ceiling and I just couldn't do it. I am not afraid, nor sad. Just.... a walking dead. Though I attempted many times too, but always failed.

I'm not sure how many of you feel the same but I just can't do it maybe because I'm curious to find out if there will be a brand new ending. 

I thought I had my last home cooked meal tonight and was going to end it all now. But ended up getting high off shit again. I wish something good happens for once.

I can't take myself anymore,"I don't really know what im expecting of righting this but at this point i'm willing to do anything to stop this unbearable pain of existing.

I'm gonna give you a brief overview over my entire life and what exactly it is right now that lead me to the decision that my life is not worth living anymore.

Elementary School was hell. Had a teacher that sat me behind a bookshelf from which i wasnt even able to see the blackboard or participate in class because i was ""distracing"" the other children. The teacher videotaped me ""misbehaving"" in class to ridicule my parents and parentsmeetings. I was a smart kid. I was able to write and do basic math before i went to school. I was bored. When i was finished with my stuff I walked through the room and helped the children that were struggling. I dont see any misbehaving in that but maybe im wrong. Final report card was straight A's. Teacher still recommended that i go to a school for idiots. In my country this recommendation is on the report card. When i applied at ""normal"" schools not a single one wanted to teach me because of that recommendation which was just straigh up bullshit. In the end i found a school that saw my potential and didnt care about the recommendation. So i was able to get a decent education.

While all of that was happening home was hell. My dad was violent and abusive and my mother never intervened when he punched me in the face etc. i dont know if she did not care or if she was afraid. it doesnt matter to me. I felt and still feel abandoned. 

From age 9-12 my older brother was raping me over and over. Not like once a  month or something. EVERY SINGLE DAY. sometimes even multiple times. But who should i have asked for help? my father that is violent me? my mother that doesnt do shit? He even invited his friends to watch and spit on me.

With 14 i had the realization that i wasnt normal anymore. I wasnt talking alot. I stopped enjoying literally anything. Thats also when i started to cut myself.

Fast forward to me being 19. I finished school. Got my highschool diploma eventhough i was suffering from severe depression as i found out later. I also had 1 friend. Lets call her L. I got a job over 100 miles away from my parents. I moved out. Lived there in terrible conditions since i made almost no money. But i think i felt better. Im not sure since i was stoned most of the time. After 3 years living away from my parents L tried to commit suicide. I blame myself but i dont want to get into detail of why that is. She survived. I was there for her. I took all my years vacation to be there for her. 

6 Months later i live with my parents again since i was breaking down and wasnt able to take care of myself anymore. i admit myself to a mental hospital because i was highly suicidal and L urged me to do it. After i admitted myself L blocked me on all social media up to this day. This was 3 years ago. I stayed 3 months in the hospital and learned alot. I learned that i suffer from depression, paranoia, narcissm, have borderline personality disorder and have symptoms that might be a psychosis but no one can confirm or deny this. I was talking about all the stuff that happened to me. But i learned nothing to cope with that stuff. Or accept it. Or stop thinking about it constantly. 

Basically i was worse than before. Everything was fresh in my mind. But no one taught me how to deal with that stuff. But hospital said i was ""healed"".

I moved out from my parents again and got a job in a callcenter since that was the only thing available in my hometown. I got minimum wage, had to have crazy amounts of knowledge, had extreme stats i had to reach or i was laid off and i hated every second. I was sick alot. Like ALOT. Every 2-3 weeks i had something. From colds, flu, migrane etc.

I stayed for a whole year. Eventho i was sick often i had exceptional stats. 99% customer satisfaction with extremely low talk time etc. Then i quit. I couldnt take it anymore. The constant pressure. Knowing that i will never be promoted no matter how good i am. Constant stuggle with money. I was miserable.

So i went into a different mental hospital. Did dialectic behavioural therapy instead of trauma therapy. Learned to use skills. Which is basically just finding something to occupy your brain so you stop thinking your sick sad thoughts. Does it solve anything? No, not at all. Do i feel better? No.

In therapy i found a girlfriend. She is perfect. She talks with me. She is understanding. But im struggling so hard since i have this paranoia that literally any person on this planet is just trying to hurt me. I trust her. I know that my thoughts are not real. But it hurts so fucking much. Just a few days ago she got her period. Almost 2 weeks earlier than expected. My thought process to this situation was. ""Well she was partying with her friends last weekend. She probably fucked a dude there, got Plan-B and one the side effects is that your period might come earlier or later than expected."" Like what the hell? How do you even come up with something like that? I feels like i just want to hurt myself. I should be happy. She is doing everything she can. And i cant appreciate it since my mind is just thinking up storys to hurt me. This literally makes me feel like im insane. Why would i do that to me?

Now im unemployed. Get my money from health insurance. Well for the next week that is. My psychiatrist told me that he wont be writing me sick any longer. He gave me no reason why he wont continue since he is 100% aware of my mental state. That means i dont get any money from my health insurance anymore since they think im healthy. Which means i have to get money from the state for being umemployed. Getting money from the state in my country means that you are required to apply for jobs. For ANY job that the state choses for you. If you dont apply (and show up to interviews or decline a job offer) they wont give you money. Like literally 0.

I cant work. I cant even apply for a job. Im not even able to keep my small flat clean or keep care of myself.

Tonight I wanna end it all,"It all started 2 years ago when on my 15th birthday my friend gifted me a video game called CSGO and I though it was gonna be the best thing ever as I was new to gaming. Then I met a guy from the UK by the name Nukes on steam ( a gaming platform) and he was good friends with me for a year we used to play sometimes and chit chat about csgo trading and stuff. And then my next birthday I decided to buying a $100 steam wallet code with all my saving of past year + birthday money ( its a big deal for me as I dont have a job yet student nor rich) and Nukes told me his ideas and how it would be great if I could send it to him and he could get me profit from trading items in the game ( he was on steam for 3-4 years already) so like any innocent person I went with it. Then it started. Me finding out he lied to me and started blackmailing me, acting racist to me, forcing me to do stuff like shaving my eveybrows and calling his friend the n word on tape if I wanted my money back, I was naive and though if this is how I could get my money back it wont be a big deal. It went on from there, he moved on to asking my socials and always under the pretext one last thing you need to do, I was getting severely cyber bullied and abused day and night but didn't tell anyone and use to cry everyday at night. He even went on stalk my youtube channel make more false promises, message my real life friends when I tried to block him and lure me back.

Done fighting,"On mobile so if my formatting sucks, well that’s another thing I’ve failed at.

I’ve been fighting my whole life to survive. I was severely abused and neglected as a child. My childhood was a constant battle, being beaten, starved, mentally abused and broken down. 
As a teen I was sexually assaulted at 14 by step brother then my “best friend” at 15. Still being mentally abused by my mother. Which led to a suicide attempt at 16, I took a bottle of Xanax and oxy. Sadly, I was found woke up in the hospital having a tube being shoved down my throat and the taste of charcoal. Soon after I got in a relationship with a man who cut me off from my friends and family. Beat me and made to tell me how worthless I am on a daily basis. Got away at 18 almost 19. Which involved him stalking me and terrorizing me. Ive been struggling with a eating disorder that whole time. At 19 met my soon to be ex husband he was never abusive just clueless, everything I did was never good enough. Never validated my feelings. I had 5 children from 21-29. I left my husband at 30, got in a relationship with another man. Who ended up abusing me. He raped me, beat me, and mentally abused me. He also introduced me to drugs. Now I’ve been struggling with addiction, and an eating disorder. I left him 4 months in that was last year. Pressed charges, my soon to be ex husband has given me a place to stay because he needs the nanny. But his mom is moving in. And I’m going to be homeless, I know my kids deserve so much more than a mentally broken mother who is so withdrawn. So I gave custody freely to him. I am so tired of struggling with my thoughts. I have been fighting my whole life. I can’t anymore. 

I have a plan next week to get a hotel and make it look like a accidental overdose so my ex gets all the life insurance money.

Quite a lot of suicidal thoughts lately....,"So this is getting straight out of fucking hand. I'm a young male, studying and I feel like whatever's this feeling (Anxiety? Depression? Stress? I have no fucking clue!) Is catching up with me. Now: supposedly I have a loving family, friends.... All that shit you already know. But I don't want to talk to them, not even my gf, in whom I'd trust almost anything. Grades are fucking reverse skyrocketing. I CAN'T get myself to sit down and study shit. I'm probably going to fail music, even although I have been taught music in a music school for about 7 years. I just don't understand some subjects and probably won't at all. Worst part is we are having a trip to Ireland before the summer break, and you are automatically chosen out if you fail 2 or more subjects. I will probably fail French, Music, Spanish, Math, and most likely Physics and chemistry. Now, of all of those I just used to struggle with math BTW.

So just recently I've started cutting myself again. Not serious wounds straight in the veins. But cuts in my left hand and arm which stay there for quite a while. I will most likely continue doing so as my grades keep coming in. I will most likely get any source of music taken away from me (PC, Mp3, Phone....) And this won't help at all with the situation. 

Also recently I started going out with a girl I liked since 2-3 years ago, and she has liked me for the same time. This is the first relationship for both of us. None of us has ever kissed, made out with anyone, etc. And we are both really shy. And I have had friends since the start of the relationship (We've been together for 3 months now) trying to pressure both of us into making out. I, as the coward I am, obviously couldn't make it happen despite her FUCKING TELLING ME SHE WANTS TO. 

And I've also had quite a high number of suicidal thoughts lately. Mostly think of how could I do it...
Think of hanging myself, OD to death, find a gun somewhere (not common at all in my country) and blow my head off, cut myself, tie a rope around my neck and stretch it so hard I die, sealing my swimming pool while turning on the water for it to slowly rise and drown me, put a toaster with me in the bath.... I'm quite creative, really....

Also I've been finding it hard to find reasons to stay alive. I feel like a burden for my GF and family, only see myself as a weight they must lift to carry on and never, ever, feel like doing something useful that someone would be thankful for.",Mario_CarCal,1,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/fcvamc/quite_a_lot_of_suicidal_thoughts_lately/,getting straight fucking hand young male studying feel like whatever feeling anxiety depression stress fucking clue catching supposedly loving family friend shit already know want talk even gf trust almost anything grade fucking reverse skyrocketing get sit study shit probably going fail music even although taught music music school 7 year understand subject probably worst part trip ireland summer break automatically chosen fail 2 subject probably fail french music spanish math likely physic chemistry used struggle math btw recently started cutting serious wound straight vein cut left hand arm stay quite likely continue grade keep coming likely get source music taken away pc mp3 phone help situation also recently started going girl liked since 2 3 year ago ha liked time first relationship u none u ha ever kissed made anyone etc really shy friend since start relationship together 3 month trying pressure u making coward obviously make happen despite fucking telling want also quite high number suicidal thought lately mostly think could think hanging od death find gun somewhere common country blow head cut tie rope around neck stretch hard die sealing swimming pool turning water slowly rise drown put toaster bath quite creative really also finding hard find reason stay alive feel like burden gf family see weight must lift carry never ever feel like something useful someone would thankful,quite lot suicidal thought lately,mario car cal
Help.,"I wake up every morning not wanting to exist. My dad died last month and now I can’t get these thoughts out of my head. He had been depressed for a long time and we often talked about mental health with each other. His mother had committed suicide via overdose when he was quite young. He died of natural causes in his sleep, and I just want to join him. I want to find the power to continue living but every day is a battle and I just don’t know how to cope anymore. My thoughts have been getting darker and darker by the day and I’m beginning to fear myself. I’d like to reach out to people for help but I’ve never been able to do that; I feel like I have a mental barrier and just can’t get past it to better myself.

If u believe in incarnation it actually make sense right? I just been thinking a lot 

The sad truth is half of the people on this sub that giving advice to people who about to give up is just on the high of depression right now what I mean is u like all of us here been dealing with depression and maybe u getting better or u think this time it ganna be different maybe this is last time I’m feeling better right

Everything is falling apart,"I've already had a lot going on in my personal life, and I was closer to suicide than I'd ever been. Then there was a huge argument among my friends. I won't get into details, but I don't think they'll make up. I was right in the middle and now I need to fucking pick a side. But I don't want to pick a side. If I do I'll lose some of my friends, and I am neutral on the whole situation anyway. If I don't pick a side, I'll start spending more time with one group than the other because I hate changing things, and then they'll hate me. So I'm going to isolate. I won't sit with them in the morning or at lunch, I'll only work with them in class if they come to me, etc. If they want to talk to me they'll find me. I don't have any other friends, so I'll be completely alone. Of course, that'll only happen if I don't end up killing myself before the end of March break. I was so close to suicide before the argument, but now I'm pushed past my limit. I'll probably go for the next opportunity I get (i.e. know I'll be home alone for 2+ hours). I just can't take this anymore, it's all become too much. I don't really want to die, but nothing ever gets better so what's the point.

"I feel so hopeless at this point, I want to be encouraged to end my misery","I'm 49, single and still a virgin believe it or not.

Religion,  Neuroticism , introversion, possible aspergers etc. It is not a simple problem.

I'm a guy. Today is my bday.I bought a can of chlorinated brake cleaner and want to hit it with a welder. That is pretty much what they used in WWI to wipe out the trenches. You smell a fresh cut lawn and a day later you are in a great place. I don't care if I suffer a bit but it is a 100% kill rate. Every single day is suffering for me.

No, I'm not some 19 yo writing this. They have their whole life ahead of them.

Now, it is not like I went out without a fight. In the last few years I watched every self help video. Most were aimed at young guys probably.

I bought clothes.

I have cool hobbies. I work on cars. I fix houses. I like to cook.

I work out. I run and rollerblade - 25 miles is not a problem - I don't even get out of breath. I'm still skinny though and built almost like a teenager. I tried to build muscle but I can't. Men my age look ""substantial."" My neighbor is my age EASILY twice my size. I look at men and I see their wrists and bones, I'm built like a woman. There is something unfixably wrong with me.

I feel like I'm dead and invisible to women. People my age are married with kids and enjoying life. I die inside when I see couples. I missed out on so much in life.  No one even wishes me happy birthday. It is hard to understand what truly being alone is like. It is like death in a way.

I'll never have kids or a family at this point. I just don't want to be the creepy old single man.

I have a computer company and make mid 6 figures, but it brings me zero joy. I'm not trying to brag, and I know other people struggle financially and feel bad but would you want to sit ALONE in front of 4 monitors for 12 hrs a day to make this money? I don't hate the work but why do it if I have no one to share it with?? I feel so alone, like I'm working from hell. I guess people benefit from my work indirectly thru the taxes I pay and the welfare and SNAP they get.

I just need the courage to empty this can and light up the contents. I'll finally be at peace. There is nothing at this point that will make me get better.

Why is it so hard to be happy?,"I am in my 40's, fought high and low with my depression and thought that I was over it but in reality its never have gone away...  I am in my life once again living a lie. A lie that is to much for myself to move forward. I have a great family, nice new Home, Nice cars, new business and great career.  but nothing seems to make me happy any longer  and the more I think and want is to end my life...

Yes I know suicide is the  easy way out to a temporary problem.  But in my life today  its no longer temporary. It feels that I can no longer feel myself to be alive anymore...  This is not my 1st rodeo but I did try to end my life over 10 years ago and wish I never survived it but I did and I am here again today thinking that, the feelings I am feeling is  to much for one person to take on every day every second and mostly every breath I take...

There are days I want to end my life and finding a way to end it, but I am a POS for not following threw any of. When I go to bed i say a prayer...   I now go to sleep, my lord my soul for you to keep,  as I don't need to wake in the morning so please take my life and let me rest in peace in my sleep, praise to you my lord my savoir, take my life , take my soul and take away the pain i am living as the pain to live is to much for me to take everyday to wear a fake smile.

Every day I drive my vehicle to the office  and thinking  what pole, what bridge, what wall or Truck  I can drive into, or what building  I can jump from so that I can never feel this pain that I feel

I now know why the funnest man alive as in Robin Williams end his life as now I want to do the same,,

I just want to be done,"I’m a 21 year old and my birthday is in two week’s (st.Patrick’s day), my entire life has been rough. From the moment I was born I had heart issue’s and growing up I had a growth deficiency, to then my ribs growing in words and crushing my lung’s along with asthma. That’s just a small portion but it sums it up. From losing my dad at 15 when I finally was at an age to do thing’s he liked which I developed a love for because I got to hangout with him, to then never being able to do them again and having to retire from hockey and sports because my lungs are so small due to my chest issues. Everyone left, I had nobody when I lost my dad, I spent years silent, didn’t talk to anyone, same racial expression everyday. I dragged myself out of the hole, then life continues and people keep coming and going and destroying me on the way out with friends betraying me and relationships being cheated on. I’ve never been good enough for anyone. My mother doesn’t speak to me anymore, she’ll go through my siblings to contact me. She also moved across the usa. Finally I’ve hit a point where I just don’t want to keep praying for better day‘s. It’s been 6 years of in and out of hospitals for mental issues and thing’s just never get better. I then lost my best friends dad from cancer whose family took me in when I was on the brink of ending it all and they helped me get better and it worked until my previous relationship. I mean I was happy again. Like I felt normal. I wasn’t crying every morning and every night. I was excited for the day. But it’s been about 9 months since that and I’ve cut the world off and I haven’t spoke to anyone in week’s bc nobody ever tried to contact me and it was always me reaching out so I stop tried. I have no confidence left and I have no chill anymore, I’m just the guy that’s there with his headphones in always. I’m tired. I can’t seem to do anything right. I just want to be at peace, I don’t want to be here but I can’t do that to my siblings. Even tho we don’t get along well I don’t want them to enter a depressed state like I’ve gone through for years. I’m just running out of energy and idk how much longer I can do it until I just say fuck it and be done and end it, end my pain.

So sick of being so lonely,"I just don't know how to be normal anymore. The littlest things can set me off. I'm always hurting peoples feelings with jokes I make, then I always say ""Don't be so sensitive"" when I know for sure it was MY fault they got offended. It's hard for me to take responsibility.

I also feel very alone, and I don't mean the sense of friendships. I'm talking about romantic relationships. I've had about 4 or 5 concussions, and I say that because I know I've definitely had some that weren't diagnosed as I used to box. It's just really hard for me to say what I want to say. I fumble my words a lot, and I noticed that after my most recent concussion about a month ago.

For example, one thing I said that I regret was calling a girl a ""dyke"" because she said something rude to me. What I said was so uncalled for, especially since I knew she was bisexual. I feel like trash because I don't say things like this (homophobic) all the time per-say, but that is just an example of how offensive and unregulated the stuff that comes out of my mouth on the daily.

I constantly have to be high on marijuana most of the time to keep my mood up and I don't want to be like that. The weed just makes things worse for me when I'm not high because I get even more irritable then I was before I smoked and I go through bad anxiety and psychosis episodes.

I also feel like a failure. I am in my senior year of high school and I feel hopeless. My grades are all F's and I don't know what to do anymore. I plan on going to trade school after this year but I probably won't follow through on that because I never follow through on anything I want to do,  as my anxiety prevents me from doing lots of stuff.

I think about suicide but the thought scares me and it's just and endless cycle of just that and it sends me down a dark hole in my thoughts. I feel hopeless like nothing can help me anymore.

Also, I don't want to sound pathetic but its what I am. I told the girl I like that I liked her. She said doesn't reciprocate those feelings but it hurt when she said she liked me 2 years prior.

i feel like im the hostage of myself,"i dont know but im trying to live life normally and all but there's always this 'voice' or these thoughts that keeps me pushing away from the good things, i just cant accept to try my best for myself. i need to stop what i like doing, ignore persons and all just because of that 'voice' in my head that keeps pushing me down. i've really been feeling down and down and down, all i see is dark, my entire universe is black, there's no light.. every time i find a sparkle it fades away so fast. I just ask for one thing: i want to die.

im the kind of person that cant say no, and try my best to help everyone and to look nice to everyone but i feel so lost inside, i cant make choices. im just doing what that 'voice' keeps telling me but everytime i feel like im getting lower and lower. i've already planned everything for my suicide and if things wont get better, ill just do it. i have nothing to lose. 

sometimes i wish i could have a soul I can ally with to beat that voice... im just lost. i wish maybe something could help me, anyone... help me make decisions. idk i've always been so lonely, and i have big problems socializing because of this 'voice', i might have friends that love me but i feel like im just nothing, and THAT 'voice' just keeps pushing me away from them and from everyone. i try to make new friends, meet lots of people but in the end i feel bad and i end up ignoring everyone and staying hostage of that 'voice'.... i dont get it because when im with people and all i dont seem to be strange or anything i try to tell things so people notice i have problems but in the end im just closing myself with my own thoughts and cant seem to try anything to beat myself on my own game....

Ran out of people to turn to,"I'm 9 years post the hospitalizations/drug guinea pig era and all the bullshit that comes from not having enough money or insurance to afford professionals that won't prescribe you Jesus or tell you withdrawals don't exist and it's purely psychological. Like, to summarize. I'm 24 now and have managed a normal and social life at school and my restaurant jobs when almost 10 years ago just the thought of leaving my house would give me severe panic attacks. Took a long ass time to fix. I got fit and cute and all that and did the [meetup.com](https://meetup.com) things and socialized with errybody like I learned on the internet and stuff.

A year and a half ago my father suddenly gave me a deadline to leave our apartment. Then pushed it earlier and changed the locks while I was crashing somewhere else. He eventually confessed he's uncomfortable having me in his home because of what I went through and just can't have me around anymore. It's insanely fucked up to have that thrown in your face and then some. ""Our"" became his and everything else his wife's.

When I became homeless periodically this past year, none of my friends or family and family friends helped me when I asked or begged. My relatives cut contact again and most of my friends and people I knew never got back to me while others awkwardly explained how we can't be friends anymore. Even people who knew me personally and what I had gone through just stopped responding to me. In person it was this strange distance from them like I'm a stranger to them. I guess reality started unfolding when things got real. You see your true friends when your heart really needs them.

Unfortunately I had a mental break at work during all this and panicked the fuck out into a depression storm and smashed a glass to use on myself in the back of my restaurant. Everyone was supportive that night and my manager got me in contact with the company's employee support fund stuff to put together money for a deposit for a place and anxiety accommodations at work. The next shifts everybody working there behaved as if I wasn't in the same room and would avoid interacting with me. I was fired a few days later and HR did absolutely nothing. I loved that place and made good money but fucked it up in a snap.

I've been homeless on and off and I couldn't get into any shelters with welfare vouchers or go on SNAP/Section 8, etc because I'm one of those DACA people. The good shelters were always full and the social workers would tell me if I know somewhere I can sleep safe, it's better to do that than the overpopulated homeless shelters here in the NY/NJ metro area. So I'd hide in people's backyards and in abandoned buildings in richer towns at night and hang around parks/libraries during the day. My dad offered to pay rent for my own place for now after he found me sleeping in his garage in 15 degree weather thank fuck for that.

Dozens of online job apps and irl job apps done and still nothing. Then the thoughts come over and over and I don't know what to do. Prozac makes me act on the thoughts while no prozac makes me tolerate them in a panic. I stay off it and just tolerate panicking and crying it away. I can't afford school and my own place while working full-time and don't have enough money to renew my DACA. Future is fucked up. The one support I got doesn't wanna talk to me and pays to keep me away. Oof. My mind calmed down after turning this into a vent..

I really fucked up,"I messed up. I screwed up the trust I've built with my boyfriend who has paranoia.

My entire life I was afraid of confronting people. I got it from my parents. I would either get yelled at asking for help or they would help. It scared me that I couldn't confront normally as anyone else would. My boyfriend had problems carrying from toxic relationships he's had and I felt like he was bringing it into ours. I wanted to help him but instead of confronting him first I confronted a friend and told them what was up. The promises I've made to him, broken. I wanted to help him first and I felt that it was necessary. Then, because of all of this, my best friend and he argued and argued and they broke off, a lot of details here are not added because it's personal but I just felt like I'm at the bottom of the food chain. Why be here if I just destroy everything. I broke the trust I've built into him, I ruined a friendship I've had and one of the ones my boyfriend had. I feel like I just don't deserve to exist and I've always felt like that from all the mistakes I make. I just wanted to help but instead, I bring misery. I'm sorry for posting this and dabbling on but I felt like I needed to just choke something out because my heart just hurts from repeating the same thoughts in my head that I'm the worst and it would've been better if my suicide attempt two years ago worked.

Best caliber for suicide?,"Deciding I'm going to end my life and I want it to be as painless as possible. Please don't waste time trying to talk me out of it, I just feel life suicide should be everyones right. 

If I was shooting myself in the head, what caliber is best?

9mm, smaller. Better penetration, but maybe won't penetrate skull? 

.40, feeling like it's the best of both worlds between 9mm and .45, bigger and more power.

.45 bigger, but slower bullet, maybe won't penetrate skull either at point blank range. 

.357 sig, feeling like it should be either this or the .40, although my military friend says .40 sucks and 9mm is better than .40. 

What do you think? Been watching penetration videos on YouTube but obviously none of them are for a skullx or point blank.

I feel like I can’t live without her.,"we dated for a year. i broke up with her because we were arguing all the time and she was always getting mad at me. alas, i could’ve been better about not making her mad but anyways, it happened. she tried to reach out the first two weeks after it happened but i felt that we needed time to mature if we wanted to get back together. i still loved her and wanted to be with her, but i felt we needed time. about a month later, i got back in contact and she had started to try to move on. had done stuff with another guy. i fought. and fought. and fought. and fought. things started to pick up. we were hanging out again. it felt like we were back together. i kept fighting. kept fighting. kept fighting. kept fighting. till about 3 months later when she said she didn’t feel the same anymore. and she’d done stuff with 3 other guys. granted, she’s single and she can do what she wants. i just wish she would’ve told me sooner. she said she’ll always have some sort of feelings for me and that i was the first person she loved. all of this to say, i still am so in love with her and want to spend the rest of my life with her. i really do. i don’t want to live without her. for the first time since i was bullied in middle school (i’m in college now), i’m having genuine suicidal thoughts again. i don’t want to live without her. i can’t stand the thought of not being with her. and her being with someone else. i want that to be me. i want her to love me again and see that i can be the man she wants and needs. i don’t know what to do with myself. i’ve hardly been eating these past few days and just genuinely haven’t been hungry. if i don’t work during the week (i work a part time job landscaping and we work if the weather permits, lately it has not) i just lay in bed and sulk and sleep. that’s all. i don’t know what to do with myself and i don’t want to live without her. she’s moved on and likes someone else now and they spend time together. and i can’t take it. i don’t know what to do.",austinh7298,3,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/fcs773/i_feel_like_i_cant_live_without_her/,dated year broke arguing time wa always getting mad ala could better making mad anyways happened tried reach first two week happened felt needed time mature wanted get back together still loved wanted felt needed time month later got back contact started try move done stuff another guy fought fought fought fought thing started pick hanging felt like back together kept fighting kept fighting kept fighting kept fighting till 3 month later said feel anymore done stuff 3 guy granted single want wish would told sooner said always sort feeling wa first person loved say still love want spend rest life really want live without first time since wa bullied middle school college genuine suicidal thought want live without stand thought someone else want want love see man want need know hardly eating past day genuinely hungry work week work part time job landscaping work weather permit lately ha lay bed sulk sleep know want live without moved like someone else spend time together take know,feel like live without,austin h 7298
"Constantly thinking about suicide, nothing to live for etc","Lately I've been experiencing more and more suicidal thoughts, I cry all the time and worry about everything. I feel like I have nothing going for me in my life and that the better years are behind me.

On valentine's Day this year I was put on Zoloft after finally going back to the doctors. I have had CBT and counseling in the past but just nothing seems to work and it's all too much for me to cope with.

"Nobody cares and ""help"" doesnt work","I don't have any friends, haven't for years. I go months without talking to anyone and I cry when I see happy people in public. I have a lot of trauma from sexual abuse+trafficking and it makes me not want to live in such a sick world. I first got diagnosed with depression when I was 8. I don't see a point in going on. People would say it gets better but it's gotten objectively worse every year for nearly a decade. I'll never be healthy enough to have the life I want. I've tried all sorts of things including CBT, DBT, EMDR, yoga, meditation, behavioral therapy, art therapy, etc. I eat healthy, I do everything I'm supposed to. I've tried dozens of medications ranging from anti depressants to anxiety meds to mood stabilizers, all which in the end have either caused a severe health side effect, made me even more suicidal, or made me psychotic.

If you try to get ""help"" and talk to someone about being suicidal in the US you're just apprehended by police, handcuffed, thrown in an ambulance, and shipped off to a psych ward where staff verbally and physically abuses you for the next 72 hours to 2 weeks. (At the youth psych ward by my house they put you in solitary confinement for CRYING). Then you get out feeling even more scared and hopeless, disgruntled with the world and sickened by the fact that this is the ""help"" out there. Then you get more suicidal because you were just abused for days on end and realize there's literally nothing you can do. So you'll get locked in the psych ward again, be treated like shit again, continue getting more depressed, angry, and resentful, rinse and repeat. The system just chips away at you until there's nothing left so that you finally off yourself so they don't have to deal with you anymore.",Foreverhater,4,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/fcqs08/nobody_cares_and_help_doesnt_work/,friend year go month without talking anyone cry see happy people public lot trauma sexual abuse trafficking make want live sick world first got diagnosed depression wa 8 see point going people would say get better gotten objectively worse every year nearly decade never healthy enough life want tried sort thing including cbt dbt emdr yoga meditation behavioral therapy art therapy etc eat healthy everything supposed tried dozen medication ranging anti depressant anxiety med mood stabilizer end either caused severe health side effect made even suicidal made psychotic try get help talk someone suicidal u apprehended police handcuffed thrown ambulance shipped psych ward staff verbally physically abuse next 72 hour 2 week youth psych ward house put solitary confinement cry get feeling even scared hopeless disgruntled world sickened fact help get suicidal abused day end realize literally nothing get locked psych ward treated like shit continue getting depressed angry resentful rinse repeat system chip away nothing left finally deal anymore,nobody care help doesnt work,forever hater

"To those concerned with how they look, ""the way you look in the mirror.""","I used to be concerned with my image too, until once I came up with a little thought experiment.

Imagine that you live in a world where you look to others the way you feel, and depending on how good you feel inside how good you appear to others. This is kind of real for hormones and these produce pheromones. Anyone can feel a certain way within, and this has a direct impact in others. Not only that, but the fact that most of the time you are not looking at yourself, the only thing you percieve of yourself is how you feel, so focus on just that.

&amp;#x200B;

We live in a world where everyone is self conscious, so never think people are observing you more than that people are just focused on how the world percieves them, just what happens to you, so come out of that mental trancestate and be one of the few people that can burst out of that bubble.",Asasuma,4,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/fcltz3/to_those_concerned_with_how_they_look_the_way_you/,used concerned image came little thought experiment imagine live world look others way feel depending good feel inside good appear others kind real hormone produce pheromone anyone feel certain way within ha direct impact others fact time looking thing percieve feel focus amp x200b live world everyone self conscious never think people observing people focused world percieves happens come mental trancestate one people burst bubble,concerned look way look mirror,uma

I’m giving up hope.,It’s been almost a year since I was put on antidepressants and nothings changed. They’ve tried different meds and different doses but it doesn’t work. At first I was slowly giving up but now I just rapidly feel like nobody can help me like I’m just a shit stain everyone walks on and I know for a fucking fact I wouldn’t be missed. Jesus Christ I sound pitiful but god damn it there’s nothing left for me. I’ve been diagnosed with PTSD recently and they tell me that my depression is from the PTSD but Jesus I feel like I’m just another mark on the books of a fucked up people. Every day I hope to fucking god I don’t wake up and every day I do. Everyday it takes me two hours to get to sleep only to have nightmares and wake up after two hours. I’m so fucking tired and I’m so fucking done with trying. The universe has won and I feel like now it’s just waiting with a bowl of popcorn to see how I end.

The Day My Mom Dies Is The Day I Do Too,"My mom is my biggest supporter but also the most sensitive and emotional person there is. When I want her to cheer me up, she starts crying too because she’s so empathetic and it ends up being me who has to cheer HER up. She doesn’t mean to, it just happens. I love her to death but her emotions often comes first. Which makes me not wanna talk to her about my health at all.

I turned 16 yesterday, but I feel like my life is going by way too fast. I’m gay, have no friends and all I do is lie in bed and cry. 

Because I’m gay, I’ll never experience the feeling of having a teenage romance. I’ll never get asked to prom. I’ll never glance at a guy in my class and get a smile or a glance back. I’d say I’m fairly handsome to my knowledge and I try to care for others so it’s not that I’m undateable. It’s just that “everybody’s straight until proven gay”, if you know what I mean.

I just wanna live in a world where I can ask for a guys number without him being weirded out because “he’s not a homo”.

My life is going by way too fast. I’m afraid I’ll be alone forever. I’m impatient. I know I’m only 16. But I’m already so tired of this life. I’m missing out on so much the other straight kids my age are doing. I wanna live their simple life, but obviously I can’t. 

I’m just so tired of everything. I want it to end. I want to believe that I’ll be reborn as a straight guy or girl. To fall in love and having a chance with them. I want to live that life. I want to live an easy life with the only struggle being that the screen on my phone has a crack. I don’t believe in it, I just wish that’s what happens when you die.

But I can’t take my life. I could never do that to my mom. As I said: she’s emotional. She would be heartbroken. She’s been depressed before and I’m certain she would grow into old habits if I were to disappear. 

Sometimes I just wish she would die so I could take my life without hurting her. It’s awful and I’m ashamed to be writing this. I just want everything to end. I want everything to end with my mom.

EDIT: Hey, it’s me a few hours later. I almost become a different person when I have these kind of depressive episodes. Looking back at this post now, I feel bad. I now understand that what I said can come across as ignorant. Which I certainly am. I’m only 16. I have a whole life in front of me. And when I’m feeling this down, I push all positive things about my life away. I have to hold on. I have to wait. My life has barely begun.

I don’t actually want my mom to die. I just wanted to disappear without leaving her behind. I’m feeling better now but I’m sure I’ll come back to this post when I’m sad again.

I'm too stupid to achieve anything in life. I'm thinking of taking my life tomorrow night.,"I have a low IQ. Twice I've been tested and both times I got an IQ around 84-85. Somehow, I didn't do entirely awful in school, I was able to be a B student without much studying. When I actually started studying I started to get grades in the 90s and even some at 100%. Even though I skimmed through with exemplary grades, I barely retained any of what I learned. Nobody around me believes that I am stupid because of my grades, but that is all they go off of. I have a poor vocabulary overall, especially in spoken word, and I cannot do basic mental math. I still count with my fingers and I am nineteen years old. I am from a low income, uneducated family so I was innately disadvantaged from birth, also with having my mom smoke weed and cigarettes throughout her pregnancy with me. During the 8th month of her pregnancy I detached from the placenta and they had to preform an emergency c-section. It is very likely that I have brain damage from oxygen deprivation. 

 I just feel incredibly empty every moment I am awake. My favorite time of the day is when I go to sleep at night, but night always goes by too quickly. Lately I've been spending everyday sleeping because I have much more joy in my dreams. I just want at least an average intelligence, at least. It is unbearable being aware every moment that I am dumb and will only ever be dumb. I have always aspired to leave the financial hole, but everyday that passes reminds me that it will probably never happen. At this point I feel like I am stuck between a rock and a hard place, because I am terrified to leave behind my family and my pets, but I know if I continue living my life will only get worse and worse.

I got a hotel room here in my town because I needed a time for myself.,"Look, I love my family and they're awesome. But, sometimes, I need to be alone. I like being alone. My relatives have been living with me for a while now (ever since March, can you guess why?) and as someone who's been living alone for a while now it's getting pretty hard. 

I told my parents, uncles, and grandparents the truth. I bought a new book and it has just arrived, but I still haven't had the chance to read it because of them. There's no peace and quiet around them. They're the party hard kind and I'm more introverted. 

We haven't left the house in months, I really need this. I spent the day cleaning up after them because one of my two uncles insisted on making breakfast. Honestly, yeah, it was good. But, damn, no pancakes are worth that mess. He did help me, but I'm just so tired. That was the straw that broke the camel's back. After we were done with the dishes, I turned on my computer and booked a room for three days. 

I check in tomorrow at noon.

Your height is totally fine,"Lately I’ve noticed many guys around my circle and on the internet that are very self conscious about how tall they are. And that they often, unfortunately made bad experiences with girls who only date „super tall“ i.e. at least 6‘ guys. Whose girls, are not people who you want to be with. 

Let me just say to you, that it truly does not matter how tall you guys are. Really. In the end, it comes down to what kind of person you are. If they can’t appreciate you then they are not worth it. And if they reject you for that only then you are not the „problem“. 

I mean as a 5‘ girl I couldn’t care less how tall you are. So don’t beat yourselves up! 

Anyways, I hope you guys stay safe!

Edit: for my fellow Europeans 6‘ is about 182cm and 5‘ is about 150-155 cm

Edit 2: For all the tall women comes a similar stigma just the over way around. Either way you are valid and nothing less! If people can’t appreciate you for who you are they are not nice people!

Edit 3: Yes, it is totally fine to have preferences! Maybe I phrase it a lil shitty (English is not my main language) but and I mean BUT, when you make someone feel like they are not valid because of something they can’t control is not nice! (it’s just my opinion, feel free to disagree/criticise)

Edit 4: I tried to respond to everyone as much as I could but at this point I wish you all well! And sorry if I don’t respond to everyone’s message! 

Edit 5: And don’t shy away to criticise, some things are not obvious to me and I can always learn from others. Seeing others perspectives can be very helpful!

I remember this conversation with an old acquaintance years ago and it changed me,"I was at a Halloween party with my best friend, Chelsea, and she had some other friends over. This girl Michelle and I were talking and I was telling her and Chelsea a story. I can’t even remember what story it was, but half way through Chelsea said “you already told us this!” She didn’t mean it harshly at all, she likes to play

And then I remembered I told them the same story and they were both in front of me! So I was like Michelle, why didn’t you stop me sooner? 

Her reply was so sweet. She said, “well, if someone tells me something for a 2nd or 3rd time, clearly they care a lot about the story or fact so of course I’m gonna listen and act like it’s the first time I’ve ever heard it because it must mean a lot to them if they talk about it often”

And since then I have made it a point to do the same. I just thought it was so sweet and I want to listen to everyone to make them happy, too.

I asked a woman if she was OK today,"I know the title sounds fairly boring or inane, but it means more than that to me. 

I walked by a woman in a wheelchair sitting on the side of the road today. She was just far enough off the road to be in the shade so I didn't think much of it at first and went about my day.

When I was returning the other way about half an hour later I noticed she was still in the same place. She had a sullen look on her face and didn't seem happy.

My mother was sick and in a wheelchair for years although she was in a home for most of that time. She passed years ago, but this situation just reminded me far too much about what would've happened if she had to get around in a chair.

I stopped to ask the woman if she was OK - no more and no less - I didn't want to offend her or her independence in case I was completely wrong.

To my surprise her face lit up and she said she was fine and thanked me for asking her. I'm so glad I did.

My Bangladeshi coworker came up to me all blushy and shy and told me how he saw this guy in a vlog playing rock, paper, scissors on the street and he was wondering if I could teach him how to play the game.

It feels so good to be happy.,"The past few years I’ve spent a lot of time going through my own internal issues that I never really told anyone about. Guess I just never wanted to be a burden, or I didn’t feel I could trust anyone enough to confide in them. Either way, I finally feel really happy. Moved out of my home for the first time and I’m living in the city of my dreams. I don’t really have any friends here yet but I’m the happiest I’ve been since, like forever. Typically when I go back through old photos/videos from the past few years, I kind of mentally grimace knowing the pain I was going through at the time, and being okay with it. I’m looking forward to remembering this current time in my life and smiling to myself, because I know I’ll remember it fondly. I finally don’t have to lie about how I’m feeling. I read that line a few times over after writing it, that’s the first time I realized that. I hope whoever reads this is happy too, and if you’re struggling with your own issues,  just know that you’re not alone, and there is a way out. It might take a while, but it’s well worth the wait.

I am 60 years old. But somehow I am still the baby of the family,"I have two older sisters. The oldest one has always been very mother-like to me. 

And the other day I walked to the park and I saw a nice little scene. It was a pond with the moon reflection so I just took a picture. Sent it in the group chat I have with my family.

Well cue my sister “Why are you out it’s LATE and look where you are it is dark over there you should be careful it’s gonna rain tonight where is your umbrella do you want to catch a cold because that’s how you catch a cold-“

So I said “Relax I am fine.” 

But she then she called my father (he lives with me) and told him, to tell me, that I need to go home.

That’s right. My sister who is a grandmother, tattle-tailed on me to my father.

I played chess with a drunk German guy online.,"I’m an American Soldier. Last night I was enjoying my Saturday night by playing some online chess, as I frequently do. 

One of my opponents turned out to be a German student and we struck up a decent conversation in the chat box while we played a few games. He was 20 and I am 21, and we both shared common interests and goals. It was just kind of surreal to me to think about how much both society and technology has advanced in so little time.. 

If I were to tell my grandfather that 70 years after WW2 I would be playing chess with a German kid across the world I’m sure that would have blown his mind haha

It’s gone bad and one of them hasn’t even tried it.,"I poured my heart into making this big birthday cake, with fancy chocolatey decorations and all, carefully planned the recipe to their liking. It took me almost 4 hours to make. I thought it looked really pretty. I think birthday cakes are the hardest to make, because the cream is so messy and it’s hard to actually make it look nice. So as all my friends know me as the “baker” or “dessert girl”, I only make birthday cakes for the closest friends. I know that birthday cakes from where we live are either super expensive or super shitty, so I made sure to make one for them so they would have a cake on their birthday.

Today I just had to throw half of the cake away because it has gone bad, and I feel so terrible. One of the 2 birthday friends ate a piece, and the other hasn’t come by to try. I guess they didn’t mean to do it, just busy with their lives and didn’t have the chance to come over to my place to eat the cake. They have their other reasons, actually good reasons.. but idk why i can’t help but crying so hard when I threw the cake in the trash bin. It hurts even more when I saw one of them posted on insta about a cake that another friend made for him, brought it to his house, and wrote how much he loved it. I promise myself I would never make a birthday cake for anyone anymore... I’m getting so emotional over a fucking cake.

A story about the nicest homeless man I met,"I remember being 14, wandering downtown Ottawa and feening for a cigarette. I would often homeless people to bum me one on exchange for a few dollars (they were usually more than happy to do so). On this night, it was around 10pm and I asked a homeless man on the street if he had a backwood to spare for $10. He told me they were empty (he had a open brief case with wrappers) but would by me a pack of smokes from the corner store. I tossed him $20 bucks and he told me to watch his property bag while he went to the store (he just got out of jail). I talked to his friend, he told me the story of their arrest, telling me they loved jail since it was warmer than sleeping outside. When the man returned, he handed me the pack, with the full change and receipt. At the time, I wouldn't have been surprised if he ran off with the money (that was wrong of me). I was so touched, I left him with half the pack, the rest of the $20 and my hat since it was mid-winter. Ever since then, I would donate my change to every homeless person I see.

"I used to resent myself for being so honest/blunt, now I understand it’s a blessing in disguise.","My whole life I’ve had no filter. When I was young I’d accidentally hurt peoples feelings or astound adults with my intricate and deep opinions all the time. 
I never felt like I needed to hold back what I was thinking so I would just say it with my chest. This got me in trouble a lot and I never really understood why.
Now I’m an adult and I’m in a long term relationship, college, job, etc. I have found myself very quiet and apologetic in past years because I am worried that my quick tongue would ruin my relationships or reputation one day. My brain instantly fires off all these responses and emotions the second I’m in a situation that wants an answer but I often withhold —hoping someone else can do it.

RECENTLY... I’ve realized that my responses are well thought out and appropriate most of the time. What I have to say would enrich the conversation and when I don’t say it I’m actually a downer. I can’t be perfect and I most certainly won’t get anywhere if I can’t grow enough backbone to speak up when I want too. Ergo...

**If I have to, I should apologize for the tone in which I say things that offends people, but not for what I’m saying.**

The difference has really changed how I feel about public speaking and just casual conversations. It’s others who need to learn that strength behind words doesn’t always equal anger or aggression.

debating whether to shave my head...,"(just for some context, I am a 20 year old female) So shaving my head is something I've been wanting to do for a while now. I think it's just something that would be such a cool change and it's been on my bucket list for years.

(which honestly, makes me feel like doing it even more) But, here's the thing... I already don't have much luck in the relationship department and I want boys to like me...

Another thing is that I kinda want long hair for college just so I'm not growing it out awkwardly if I shave it now (who knows, maybe wouldn't even grow it back out). Buuut If I do shave it now, I will have plenty of time to grow it out before getting my future job and maybe wedding perhaps.... But per another hap...

I have face blindness and face masks have made it worse,"I have hard time recognising people, once a university did tests on me about it, for real. To recognise people I have to use things such as hair style, skin tone, usual clothes, or my favourite: voice, sometimes it's like I have not seen someone until I hear them

That said there are some people whose faces I can recognise, like my family and friends... that was until the face mask era.

Just today we were going somewhere and I fell behind form the group, I was distracted with something else, then I caught up and continued walking until this person I thought I knew said: ""Do you need anything?"" and from the voice I realised I didn't know this person. She just happened to have the same hair style and similar clothes to a friend of mine

I apologised and started scanning the scene for my friends, but there were many people all around with features that my mind registered as them. I could have used clothes, but I didn't pay too much attention to what they were wearing, you'd think I'd know to always pay attention to that by now.

I was feeling lost when someone approached me. I thought that she had realised I was worried and was going to offer me help. I was thinking how I would explain the situation but then she said: ""What are you doing?, we are waiting for you"" and I realised it was my friend

A classmate in middle school changed how I view myself.,"I have been thinking about this a lot lately. I am very much a pushover, ever since I was a child. I say I am sorry so many times a day for things I have no reason to be sorry for. I have let friends, family, partners, and nearly anyone else push me around and rarely had the confidence to stand up for myself.

Back in middle school, I met a girl when I started 6th grade. We were in the same class and from the moment I met her, she just rubbed me the wrong way. She was outgoing and funny, I was quiet and shy. She could get along with anyone and everyone, I barely had one friend, who I feel was mainly friends with me because I would let her do whatever she wanted. The new girl ( I will call her C) started in on me after about a week of school. She would loudly include me in conversations with other people I wasnt comfortable with. She gave me a nickname due to my pale skin and red  hair that I felt was malicious. Small things like this went on until about halfway through 7th grade.

C greeted me in the morning ""Hey 'nickname' why do you look so crabby? Whats wrong?"" I saw this as a personal attack and finally snapped.

""C dont call me that! I dont like it, stop picking on me etc etc"" (I cant remember the exact conversation) but I had it. I was red in the face and embarrassed for speaking out immediately. She just smiled and grabbed me in a huge hug. I may not remember every detail, but I will always remember what she said next

""Finally! You finally stood up to me. You're so strong and a great person, I wanted you to stand up for yourself and see how you don't have to let people walk all over you""

I was shocked. I started to recall all the times I thought she was picking on me. She wasn't. She was trying to include me. The nickname she gave me? I then realized she gave all of her friends nicknames.
We have been best friends ever since. I can still be a pushover, but whenever I feel it coming on, the fear of standing up for myself, I remember her smile, hug and words.

"Today, I managed to write down the complete outline of my writing project!","Calling it a novel feels weirdly pretentious, but it's getting a bit too long to be reasonably called a short story, so a project it is. 

&amp;#x200B;

I've liked to write ever since I was a kid. It was the one form of artistic expression I connected the most with, and even when I wasn't writing for one reason or another, I always felt that itch to put words to paper, to tell the story that was trapped at the back of my mind. And I want to be clear that I have no pretention to be actually good at it; hell, I don't even particularly want to get published, nor share my stuff with anyone else. I just like writing. 

&amp;#x200B;

But I've always had this problem: I'd have an idea for a setting and charcters that I loved, I'd start writing it and then I'd just... stop. Not because I'd loose interest, but because I just didn't know how to take the story further. I knew what I wanted it to look like in the end, but I had no idea how to get there. I didn't know how to build a story, really. And so, for years and years, dozens of projects have sat abandoned in my hard drive, collecting metaphorical dust because I was like a gardener with a seed and no idea how to turn it into a plant. 

&amp;#x200B;

Recently, I got fed up with this pattern. And so I figured, fuck it, if I'm not going to be naturally good at it, then I'll just have to figure it out the old-fashioned way: hard work. And that involved research. A lot of it. (By the way, there is a joke to make about someone reading a book about how to write books.) And you know what? It payed off. Learning how stories are structured - and, more importantly, that there's a method to it - was like being handed the tools and the blueprints I desperately needed to build my house. 

&amp;#x200B;

I feel like, when it comes to any kind of artistic venture, we all have this belief that talent is key, and maybe it is, but I think we also forget that most art forms are also a craft. And you can't wing a craft. Not being able to do so doesn't make you stupid, or untalented; it just means that you're a normal person that can't magically pull knowledge from the ether. 

&amp;#x200B;

After this particular bit of soul-searching, I got to work, and, lo and behold! I have the entire plot of my project planned out, all major scenes outlined with what I want them to do to move things along. It might be crap (it's probably crap; all first drafts are), but I don't even care at this point, because I actually did it. 

&amp;#x200B;

So that was my little victory of the day. I'd love to chat with you all about books or whatever thing you've managed to do today!

I didnt do 100s of pieces of homework and I have school tomorrow. Help.,"I posted this on r/offmychest but I wanted to post it here too. Here goes.

Over the course of lockdown, I've been procrastinating and only focusing on my mood and doing things I want to do like socialising with friends, playing guitar etc. Unlike most people though, when I complete work I dont feel satisfied or like I achieved something, I just feel frustrated and angry. Over some months, this became a problem. 

This past week I've been thinking: ""I wont be able to finish this amount of homework in a week, so screw it."" 

I dont know what's going to happen tomorrow and I am quite anxious. What's going to happen? Will they shout at me? What will my family think? Will I be expelled or suspended? I have only one explanation for this.

I want to live my life not being controlled or described by a grade on a sheet of paper. It's okay if I dont know a lot of general knowledge. I am a talented and strong individual who has been through a lot in my life.

Grateful at a Starbucks,"I’m sitting at a Starbucks right now &amp; I just had this overwhelming feeling of gratitude when getting a whiff of a pumpkin spice latte that passed me.

When I was in University, I was utterly depressed and lost in life. I was a barista at a Starbucks during University and although I remember fun times working there, I had a lot of issues going on at home and with my relationship. At some point I was close to failing out of University too. When I started to get my shit together, I spent a lot of time at another Starbucks in a town between my Uni &amp; home to study, &amp; I had quit my barista job at the other cafe. I spent hours &amp; hours at this Starbucks studying to try to graduate. Not knowing if I even would.
After graduation, I worked at a company where I was constantly put down &amp; paid very little. When I was laid off, I had to start job hunting again. Spending every other weekend of 8 months in the Starbucks again to job hunt.

Today I sit in a Starbucks in Europe to study for a graduate course I’m taking. I’m here because my company relocated me to help open a branch of our team here, &amp; I’m in graduate school online. I’m living a life that I wouldn’t have been able to imagine just a few years ago because I just kept failing at everything I did.

I don’t want this to come off as bragging, rather just a proclamation of how grateful I am of where I am now. My friends often tell me I suffer from the Imposter Syndrome where I never acknowledge that I worked hard to get where I am. But today I want to acknowledge that. I did work hard to get here, &amp; I’m proud of it. I still have many goals to achieve. But this little moment is my moment of gratitude &amp; acknowledgement that I didn’t succumb to the failure everyone was telling me was coming before.

Feeling grateful.
Hope everyone’s Sunday is going well.

There are bad days but at the end it all feels worth it. I feel happy and I feel like I can do it and like I can live my life from now on. And to top it off I found the love of my life. Fell in love with them the moment I saw them and they feel the same... &lt;3

A little habit I picked up while talking to non-native English speakers,"I myself am a bilingual person- I speak Hindi/Urdu along with English. Growing up in an urban, educated environment I speak fluent English and sometimes speak English better than my native tongue.

In my country English is the lingua franca and you're looked down upon if you don't speak English. I really hate this idea but its became a deeply ingrained part of our culture. A lot of times, urban rich people go out of their way to flex their English skills ie speaking with a fake American/British accent, pretending they don't understand the native language, or just being generally snobby about it. I have met preschoolers who can't speak the native language even when they throw tantrums it's in English because that's the only language they hear in their schools and homes. We maybe independent now but the colonial elitist mindset stayed behind. 

Anyway, then there also people who don't speak English that well and feel visibly self-conscious about it (mostly old people, poor urban workers, those who went to a non-English school). 

A lot of times when talking to a fluent English speaker (like me), some people make an extra effort to sound ""better"" and get nervous and fumble up. I always pick up on these cues and switch to my native language instead, in a manner that makes it seem that I too am more comfortable speaking Hindi/Urdu instead. If they don't speak my native language, I simplify my words and try to sound more natural and friendly to them.

It has worked very well till now and watching people smile in relief and hearing them express themselves better always makes me feel good.",communistpotatoes,1,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/CasualConversation/comments/io239f/a_little_habit_i_picked_up_while_talking_to/,bilingual person speak hindi urdu along english growing urban educated environment speak fluent english sometimes speak english better native tongue country english lingua franca looked upon speak english really hate idea became deeply ingrained part culture lot time urban rich people go way flex english skill ie speaking fake american british accent pretending understand native language generally snobby met preschooler speak native language even throw tantrum english language hear school home maybe independent colonial elitist mindset stayed behind anyway also people speak english well feel visibly self conscious mostly old people poor urban worker went non english school lot time talking fluent english speaker like people make extra effort sound better get nervous fumble always pick cue switch native language instead manner make seem comfortable speaking hindi urdu instead speak native language simplify word try sound natural friendly ha worked well till watching people smile relief hearing express better always make feel good,little habit picked talking non native english speaker,communist potato
Online friends are valid!,"A lot of people think that people you meet on the internet aren't the ones you can trust. What if Lara, age 19, a friend you've been talking to since two weeks is actually a guy in his thirties? Anonymity is a factor, but that shouldn't restrict you. 

I'll speak about my experience. I started making online friends probably around last year. It was difficult for me to trust people. But after a few hits and misses, I did end up making good friends from different parts of my country! One even travelled a long distance to meet me on my birthday last year. This year, getting more comfortable, I made tons of online friends on Twitter. They have been nothing but supportive! Sometimes I find more warmth in them than people who I meet daily. 

When I needed someone to talk to, my friends from Twitter helped me. They offered me support and advice. I'm sure that most of my IRL friends won't listen to me (well some would). 

The other day I was talking to my college friends about my online friends. Some of them were mortified that I let a person from the internet crash at my place on my birthday. It was something new, a gamble, but it paid off well. 

I have talked to some of the best and most interesting people online.

College parties,"So I was never a party person in highschool, I only went to a few kickbacks with my football team in highschool, and it wasnt anything big.

But i just never went to parties, i mean, i was only invited every once and a while at the start until everyone knew i would start saying no all the time which idc. I never went to school dances, I wanted to go to prom and grad night, but covid stopped that this year, so i didnt experience that stuff. But now that I'm starting college, eell community college this year, im getting lowkey hyped to go to a party.

I have this thing where I can not go to sleep if the house is messy or things are out of place- and the dishes can not be piled up in the sink,"So here I am at 1 am. My body is in complete agony because I haven't stopped since my boyfriend has moved in. To him its no big deal having things everywhere but for me it makes me feel extremely claustrophobic and anxious and just on edge. Ontop of boxes and miscellaneous things everywhere after having his friends over for the weekend of the move I had to clean and organize the entire apartment again. 

Maybe I'm crazy?? Idunno but I just can not put myself to sleep until I know things are somewhat orderly and clean. I think part of it us knowing that it would make me feel shitty if I woke up to a complete mess and a sink full of dishes- it just doesn't feel like a fresh new day if that happens.

I have a love/hate relationship with this part of myself because it keeps my place clean and me motivated but I just can not bring myself to stop when it comes to a point and then I'm exhausted and my body hurts.

Empathy and helping others feel really great and it's probably one of the most important things in life,"I probably am stating a huge cliché. It's not even something I'm just thinking for the first time but today Reddit made me realize, once again, how important and fulfilling empathy is and how helping others can help us too.

I used to come here more to rent about something, share the things that were bothering me in my life that for some reason would not share with the people in my life and it felt nice to always have some comforting words. Of course I ended up joining very other different subs, some just for laughing, some where I learned something and it's really great to belong to these communities. (I am deliberately ignoring when there are trolls or mean comments... Let's stick with the positive).

Today I needed to vent some things and then I ended up showing some empathy on posts of people on those subs that were struggling with their stuff, and now I feel lighter both because of the kind feeeback I got but also because I at least got to tell someone that they were not the only one experiencing some hard thing.

I felt like sharing this and thought this was a good sub for it. It also reminded me of a topic in high school Philosophy. I can't remember the authors now but I recall that we debated if there could be purely altruistic gestures because when we feel good about helping someone it automatically becomes selfish too.

Made a new kitty friend,"A few week ago, my sweetie was up late watching tv and had the door open to let in a cool night breeze (we have a screen door so bugs don’t come in). All of a sudden, he gets quite a scare when some unseen force thumps on the screen door! And then up pops this little kitty face, paws up on the door and all. Well, after his heart stopped racing he went out into the front stoop to meet this kitty visitor who is very sweet and playful, rolling around and just generally being cute. Well, he takes some pics and videos and shows me the next morning and I am DEVASTATED bc I was asleep and missed the whole thing! 

Earlier this week, almost a month later, kitty comes back! Sweetie texts me, saying “I know you’ve just gone up to bed, but kitty visitor is back!” So I jump out of bed, throw on a sweater and go to meet our late-night guest. Now something to note at this point is that I am not really a cat person. I didn’t grow up with cats, and I find them a bit unnerving and unpredictable. But oh my god. This cat!!! It just love to come and rub against us, meows and chit chats with us, and is generally so cute and floppy and sweet! It’s come by three nights in a row now, always around 10pm so I’ve started to expect it haha. I’ve grown very attached, and given it the nickname “cookie” bc they’re my little late night treat. 

We’re fairly isolated right now, living in the US and staying as quarantined as possible, so this little bit of excitement and sweetness has really lifted my spirits.

Today I found out that I have a sister somewhere out there and there is basically a 0% I will ever find her,"Well today was supposed to be a normal day. I was going to go on a hike and enjoy the nice weather but I got blindsided with some news that I wasn't expecting. 

I live away from home but my teen brother still lives with my mom and dad. He pretty much just called me out of the blue today upset about some news my dad shared with him. Basically when my dad was young and in college he dated a girl very briefly. They break up when my dad dropped out of school and moved away and soon after she found out she was pregnant. She asked my dad to come back and confirm it's his, and she swore up and down that it was. He said no. He didn't want to know and didn't sign up for it.

Fast forward and the baby girl is born. The mother is on her own and called my dad to let him know. She asked him to come at least see the baby. He said no again. She tells him the little girls name anyway and they had an argument because the mother decided to put the baby up for adoption.

Then basically my dad moved on and never heard from them again. I don't know why he decided to tell my brother or why he did what he did. He was young and too immature I guess but it's just kind of shocking. Our family is still complete and fairly close together so it's kind of hard to imagine I have a sister out there who my dad basically abandoned.

The hardest part is that there is 0% chance my brother and I will find her. Her name was super common, she was born in a state 8 hours away, and was put up for adoption too. She would be in her 30s now if she is alive. My dad didn't answer all of my brothers questions about it either.

My Potential Roommate is being difficult,"Ok i know the title off the bat sounds like i’m the mean roommate. But hear me out, so i’m starting college in far from home, and our university puts out a list of people that need roommates. Other people already had roommates and there’s was one girl left, she contacted me. So we started of well, we discussed apartments that had a good low cost we could evenly split. My flight date is arriving earlier then hers, so first thing that happens is she tells me to stay in a hotel so I can check out the apartment, finalize it tell her about it then move in and she can come move into the apartment later - I told her i can’t do that because i’m trying to maintain a budget plus the hotel thing will be harder since i’m going to be alone in a new place - She didn’t reply for 2 days. After that she told me her uncle lives there and he will check out the apartment- he checks it out and tells me the apartment is nice so we settle on it but we still haven’t made the payments - she again tells me that i should stay in the hotel for a few days and finalize it like that. - i tried explaining again that i can’t do that but if this isn’t working out for her then she should let me know so i can make out living arrangements. She agrees to no hotel and told me she’ll give me a reply about the apartment in two days - i also told her that please actually let me know in 2 days because my flight leave three days AFTER that. It’s been three days now and my flight is the day after tmr and we still haven’t made the payments - I texted her about an update and she left me on read. So i have no living arrangements and i get there in two days - only reason i do not want to pay for residence is because that will cost me $1000 monthly but the apartment cost split evenly between us will only cost me $630. I have contacted many other people to see if they’re looking for roommates but they aren’t so i don’t even know what to do anymore. Am i being unreasonable or doing something stupid???

The least toxic sport,"I've played a lot of sports growing up, soccer, basketball, hockey, lacrosse, swimming, and track/cross country.

I can say that the one with the least toxic people is the track and swimming. OMG, sometimes it's just ridiculous. I can't even count the amount of times we'll talk shit to the other team, or the other team will talk shit to us. Even the coaches do this.

Our team gets in a fight pretty much every season with a opposing team. It's crazy and totally unnecessary. IT'S A FUCKING GAME! CALM YOUR TITS!

However, my personal favorite is cross country because of how all the runners respect each other. Sometimes, when we're waiting at the start line, we'll even joke with the opposing runners to lighten the mood. It's a good time.

And there's no hard feelings when you get beat in a race. If anything, for me it's a good feeling.

What is a good 'parent sanity friendly' present to surprise my buddy's 5 y/o son with?,"I'm a 31 y/o single dude with no kids but my best friend has two kids (5y/o son, 2 y/o daughter). I would like to surprise his son (who I essentially consider to be my nephew) with a present but I'd like to get something that won't irritate my buddy or his wife. Like, you know how some toys are just loud and obnoxious? I don't want to get anything like that. So nothing that is super noisy or has a lot of pieces to it but something the young fella will enjoy. He is big into dinosaurs and animals, in general. But since he is five-years-old, I'm not looking to get him like a stuffed animal or anything like that. 

Preferably any suggestion would be like $20-$50 because I am no Bill Gates but I'm not opposed to splurging on a cool present for the kid. I know my buddy is under a lot of pressure with work and raising a young family and all that so I would just like to surprise his kiddo with a random gift and look like a cool uncle, you know what I mean?

You ever just have those days when the tempo of all the songs you listen to seems off?,"You know those little periods of time when the song you're listening to seems to be too fast or too slow and you can't shake the feeling that it's different somehow? I get those a lot, and it's always really weird for me. It's hard to enjoy listening to a song when it slips into the musical uncanny valley and feels all wrong.

Some songs that this affects a lot for me are Treasure by Bruno Mars, which often sounds way too slow, Hotel California by The Eagles, which usually seems too slow by just enough for it to be disconcerting, and Cool for the Summer by Demi Lovato, which nearly always seems sped up to the extent that I can't really even listen to it without immediately thinking that something is wrong.

Of course, most of the time, when I listen to those songs (and others) it seems to be a-okay, but there are days when I can't listen to anything at all without the tempo feeling weird. Yesterday was one of those days, and after only an hour or so of flicking through my playlists looking for something that seemed normal, I just gave up and stopped listening to anything at all.

This is the best I’ve ever gotten along with my parents in my life,"From the ages of about 12-18, I did not get along with my parents. It was mostly just the usual teenage angst, but in high school we were having some stupid shouting match pretty much everyday. Most of it was absolutely my fault but my parents weren’t totally free of blame either. 

Now, I’m about halfway through college and living not too far from my parents’ house. Even though it really hasn’t been that long since I moved out, our dynamic is totally different now. My parents and I get along pretty great. I think me leaving the house caused my parents to simmer down a bit, and I grew up like I needed to. Don’t get me wrong, I’ve still got a lot of growing to do, but it’s kinda cool being able to realize now how much of an idiot I was just a few years ago. 

A few days ago, my parents texted me saying they were thinking of having a bonfire with my little brother that night and they wanted to see if I wanted to join. Without much thought, I agreed and drove down and we chilled and made s’mores together. 

It’s just wild cause a few years ago I would never have even considered going back home, and my parents would never have asked me to come and hang out.

We have a Ghost Maid?,"This happened earlier tonight. I’ll try not to make this too long.

We are two college students living in a student apartment together. We both cook often and so the trash can in out kitchen fills up kind of fast.
It’s the ones with the little step on the bottom so the top opens up. 

My roommate was cooking his dinner and since the trash can was getting full he said that he was going to take it to the dumpster outside our apartment when he was done. I took out the trash at least three times before and said ok sure. Afterwards I took a shower. 

After I got out, I got a text from a friend saying if it was ok for them to come over to use the internet for work. I said ok and cleaned up my room for them to use. I noticed that the small trash can in my room was filling up so I decided to put it in the kitchen one since my roommate was going to take it out. When I stepped on the little lever to open it up, the the trash was taken out and a new bag was in. 

My first thought was “oh cool, he took out the trash, nice”. But shortly afterwards I realized he couldn’t have taken out the trash. The dumpster has a lock on it so only residents can open it. But roommates have only one trash key between us and I always have it with me. I asked if someone opened up the dumpster for him, he put it somewhere outside or had it in his room but he just said that he was in his room the entire time after he made food.

He thinks that I’m lying and I swore to him that I didn’t take it out because he said he was going to do it. We did leave the front door unlocked so someone could’ve come in. But who would come inside to change the trash? My laptop was in the living room out in the open too so they could’ve taken that instead of the trash? I really have no fucking idea. I even looked under my bed and in my closet to see if anyone snuck in while I was in the shower and my roommate was in his room. Just to let you know, we cannot have guests over due to COVID and we know absolutely no one else here except for the friend that needed to do work.

I looked up a lie detector place online and I am calling them up tomorrow. I told my roommate that I would put it on speaker so I can make an appointment to prove to him that I’m not lying and that we have a fucking ghost maid living in our apartment. We made a bet of $100 but my roommate is on the fence whether or not I am telling the truth.

I just got what I think is a sign from the universe,"I will not say at all that I’ve had a difficult life, just that I’ve gone through some difficult things. 

I went through some pretty extreme trauma during my undergrad and had to drop out of college and abandon my dream job path (after 3 years and being a standout student). I recovered and finished my degree at another local private college, but had to settle for a similar but not practical degree. I did get to fulfill my dream of being a cheerleader for that college, which led me into becoming a professional football cheerleader. 

Still, I’ve been lost trying to find a new career path. Two years after graduation, I decided to do a Master’s in a completely different field. I’m about to start that, but money has been incredibly tight for me. I was on my last $20, being told that I was every job’s second choice after solid interviews (once I was 2nd out of 200+!), and was planning on moving back home. I was out of job leads, out of my emergency fund, and out of time. 

I’ve been praying, manifesting, and trying. Two separate employers have reached out to me and we’re speaking about part time hours. If I can get both jobs, I’ll be okay. If I can just get one, I can still figure something out. 

Today, my sign: I was still concerned about my $20 bank account. I just checked and saw $250 from the state. Apparently my taxes had been filed wrong and they owed me. 

This was just the boost I needed to hold on for these last few weeks until I can hopefully get a paycheck in. I can buy some groceries and gas (and paper towels!!) and can pick up more food for my kitten. 

This honestly feels like the universe threw me a wildcard just when I was out of options. I could cry knowing that everything will be okay in my eleventh hour. I’ve been speaking out loud saying I am grateful for my many blessings and I know the universe has a plan for me, and here we are. This $250 literally could not have come at a better time if I’d orchestrated it myself.

An instance where a fairly insignificant gesture resulted in something significant to someone else,"Let me start by sharing one. 

In 2018, we visited Phuket for a short trip, and stayed at a 3 star hotel. Housekeeping staff was a young lady, who always had a smile and tidied up our room perfectly. 

On the day of our departure, she came to check the mini bar as part of the protocol to settle the bill. We had over stocked it with sweets, snacks, fruits and beverages. The items would have been worth at best around $10-15. We did not plan to take it with us and offered it to her. 

Her reaction blew us away. She kneeled on the floor and kissed our feet crying with tears of joy, thanking us.

That moment moved us, how such an insignificant gesture meant so much to her, moved us to this day.

"28 [M4F] New York Looking to chat with nurses, healthcare workers!!!"," 

Hello everyone. First off I would like to wish you a beautiful morning,evening,day,night wherever you may be.

I'm a 28 year old Medical student bored out of his mind; I would like to people who are married as they can offer fresh insight into lifes ups and downs. I remember having a penpal as a teenager although i wasn't too crazy about it; ive decided to give it another shot :)

I enjoy long walks at night, walks and hiking in nature, Psychologoical thriller movies, horror movies; conspiracy theories; indie music; non mainstream music; and art. I believe we can find an interest which we share in common as my interests are as vast as the universe :). I have pet snail; yes; a pet snail; hes ugly and BIG (huge actually the size of a Banana) but don't let that scare you; He won't eat you; he only eats squash :). His fav meal.

I'm a fairly open minded; friendly person; though the corona lockdown has made me become a bit of a hermit; perhaps you can help change that; let our friendship blossom into something beautiful! I look forward to hearing from you; once again wish you a colorful and wonderful day. Ciao =)

My pain tolerance has shifted,"So for a while, my body has been in lots of pain here and there. I've been working out and running for a long time so there is the constant muscle soreness. But due to where I work, tedious 40 hour a week shifts in which I lift heavy boxes and things all shift, my some of my muscles hurt and ache due to that too. At first, the pain was almost unbearable. 

But recently, I've noticed that has started to change. I've made comments to friends that ""I'm masochist as I am a full-time student and work full-time"" jokingly. But around when I started saying that, I've been increasingly more okay with the pain. Not exactly sure why. I was usually that kid who would take a Tylenol whenever any muscle felt a little off or hurt a little. But I now don't even opt to take a painkiller. I just power through it.

Somber thoughts - Middle school best friend got married,"My best friend from middle school just got married today. We aren’t really in each other’s lives anymore although we did keep up with each other via social media every few years. My mother went to her wedding and told me about some of my middle school friends and teachers who attended. Hearing about her wedding made me all nostalgic and I’ve been feeling pretty somber. She was my first real friend and I’m so grateful to her and her friendship. Since then we’ve gone on two different paths of life and I don’t think we could reconnect like that. I don’t know if we would be friends even if we tried. We’re just so different now. But I’m still so grateful for her and have so many heartfelt emotions of our friendship. I truly wish the best for her and wish her happiness and success. 

People are meant to serve different roles in different parts of your life. And she served a huge part in my middle school years. She was a friend to a lonely boy who had no friends. To a diseased boy no one wanted to associate with. She allowed me to feel loved when I never felt that before. And now we’re practically strangers.

It turns out that thing in in my knee was a really rare type of tumor,"Man this year has been a strange one. I graduated university in December. I then accepted a job across the country and moved to get closer to my girlfriend. Got one of the puppies my parents bred and flew it here in May. Next, my girlfriend moved in with me and we’ve been living together for a couple months now. It’s the first time I’ve lived with a SO.

Most recently I finally checked on the “fluid” I had in my right knee, probably from an injury sustained in high school soccer. The doctor said it was the size of two walnuts (side note but doctors have the weirdest length scales when it comes to tumors) MRI, XRAYs, specialists and finally an oncologist telling me that it would be best to take it out. I was lucky though. It was a big sucker, but just under the skin, thankfully outside of my knee, and was most likely benign.

Well come time for the surgery and it only lasted 10 min, but left a 6 inch incision. Very thorough and was surprised he left any for me, but it was all over with at least. Recovery wasn’t too bad. I had to push myself bending my knee in order to avoid any PT. It hurt, but it wasn’t so bad.

Finally, I go for my follow up almost 3 weeks later only to find out the pathology wasn’t done yet... weird but whatever. I then got a call 2 weeks after from a nurse saying that the doctor would be calling me later and that they had been discussing my diagnosis in a medical conference all morning.... erm what?

Turns out the tumor was one with less than 100 well documented cases, angiomatoid fibrous histiocytoma (needs a new name. Told them they could name it after me if they wanted to) it’s a low grade malignant tumor that is very very mild. He told me I should be all done with treatment, but scheduled a PET scan in December just to make sure it doesnt come back. Coolio

Being 'nice' and being 'kind' are two totally different things,"I see the distinction between the two as a matter of intention ('nice') vs. action ('kind'). It is nice to ask someone if they want a glass of water, but it is kind to go and get them a glass of water. And I think a lot of nice people are not very kind, and a lot of kind people are not all that nice. 

I was thinking about this watching 'The Last Dance' where the Bulls players talk about how Michael Jordan was a bully and went very hard on them during practice, but at the end of the day they felt grateful to him for bettering themselves. While he was not being nice, I do think he was being kind to everyone by expecting the best and helping them to achieve that with his actions.

I took a 50-minute walk today for the first time since middle school and I feel amazing.,"Back in middle school I used to be so active. I used to play basketball and go to swimming sessions. I used to play in the street with my neighbours and run for hours. I used to ride my bike for hours and not feel tired.Life was so active back then. 

I don't know what happened exactly but I stopped doing all of that.

I stopped walking to school and took the bus instead. I stopped cycling. I stopped everything. And now as a college student I find it hard to take time out of my day and exercise.

But today was different, I challenged myself that I would take a walk and see how it goes. In the first 10 minutes I started getting breathless, but towards the end it started to get a little bit easier. My body was burning like HELL and I was so red but it felt amazing.

I am bad with accepting random outcomes. Any advice is welcome,"I can accept results that has any kind of reasoning behind it just fine. For example, if I run into a tree because I was looking at a cat, I can accept that. If I do well in an exam because I prepared for it, I can accept that. 

What I can't accept are results that are random, especially negative ones. I know it sounds extremely selfish and self centered and it honestly is. For example, say I'm playing xcom, a notorious retro game known for its ability to make people yell colourful words. I make a decision with a stated 87% success chance. It fails. It's random, 87% is not 100%, I know that and yet it feels really really bad. It makes me angry. I immediately start victimizing myself.

Thing is, I know the opposite happens sometimes too. a 22% success chance, hey sometimes it works out. But those don't feel as rewarding as failing makes me angry.

How do I curb this tendency.

Today I woke up with a block of text about how she wrote mean comments on someone's facebook (only kind of warrented) and then blocks of text about the business.

I helped someone today... And yet at the end of the day i was the one left feeling blue.,"See what's going on is these 2 friends of mine, they were fighting for some reason or the other, (even they don't know what the reason was).
 Ps: one is friend. One told me not to talk to her ever again. But i wanted to do this for them. Cuz they are really tight and i couldn't see them like that...

Anyway continuing with the incident at hand. A 3rd person had a birthday today and i, well, let's just say arranged the birthday to be celebrated somewhere the two fighting could talk... Which they did and i was so happy at the end when people who weren't even talking to each other ended up like the old days. And even said goodbye 😬. Which is progress trust me...

And even then, somehow I don't know why I'm feeling blue when i should be proud and be happy for them...

Is this normal or am i just broken?

Also for refference- someone just called me insensitive a couple of days ago... So any thoughts???

I forgave myself last night,"I'm someone who doesn't have many friends so the feelings of loneliness hits hard, and it didn't help that I hated my life. Since the start of the year I've been having such dark thoughts in my head.  Everyday I would see other people my age enjoying life, doing things that I always wanted. I would wonder how my life would be like if I took things more seriously when I was younger. I wasted so many opportunities to better myself over the years. So much regret and resentment. There was nothing about me that I loved. 

Last night I was having one of those episodes of comparing my life to others. I initially starting blaming myself like I usually do but for some reason I started to I asked myself why I so hard on myself. My parents wouldn't want me to be like this. They raised me to be kind and loving but the only person that I didn't give those feelings to was me. And for the first time in my life I was kind and forgave myself. I sat at my desk and cried my eyes out but I wasn't sad. There were no feelings of hate anymore. I probably looked like a maniac because I was actually smiling, eventually laughing out loud realizing that forgiveness, something that I had no problem handing out to other people, was something I needed this entire time. I felt motivated to start living but for real this time, to learn new skills and to find something that I'm passionate about. I was happy. 

Today is my first day at my first job so I'm hoping that this feeling of happiness continues for awhile.

What's happening,"So many post about height going on here, and it just made me think that we as humans have created such a negative impact on each other regarding our physical attributes. 

I am 5'6 (average according to most standards) and sadly a little on the porky side but hey I suppose if it bothered me that much I would change it. 

Dating is practically a dead zone in my life most of my friends are abroad so my circle of influence is very limited and I would go so far as to say I am a loner. 

Socially I am outgoing and can relate or speak to anyone. I have very little judgement of people.  We all are trying to survive I guess. 

What really gets to me though is why have we become so judgemental? 

Why do we learn towards more negative environments and why do so many more people, every day feel so horribly alone? 

I read the tinder and dating over subs reddits and it really makes me wonder how 8 million people can be so connected but so disconnected at the same time. 

Are we losing touch with our own selves? Have we managed to skip over the ability to create connections? 

What could we do to change things?

I haven't been to the dentist in 7 years. I finally got the gumption up to go back to my childhood dentist and I'm pleased to say that I'm still cavity-free at 31!,"It's a bit of lie...I actually went to the dentist 6 months ago, but he was so awful that it hardly counted as a dental visit. It did, however, finally give me the nerve to go see a real dentist.

First, he didn't even floss all my teeth and the brushing they did equated to what I could do at home.

**Second, at the end of the visit he freaking dipped his fingers in vaseline and rubbed them all over my mouth. WTF!!**

So, my parents convinced my childhood dentist (who isn't taking patients) to take my husband and me as his patients. He's a really good dentist, but he's been a little tough on me when I was visiting more regularly (around 2008) because I wasn't as regular with flossing as I should be. He (lightly) sprayed me in the face with the water once because he was convinced I should have a cavity, eek! haha.

I was terrified of going to see him last week. I told him I am genuinely more worried about disappointing him than I am about disappointing my own parents, lol. He said he was just mad that I've only gone to the dentist once in since 2013.

But, I got it over with and he said my teeth looked great but that I need to floss more regularly (of course). I have no idea how I've managed to not have any cavities in my life...I'm just lucky I guess!",BushyEyes,6,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/CasualConversation/comments/incws7/i_havent_been_to_the_dentist_in_7_years_i_finally/,bit lie actually went dentist 6 month ago wa awful hardly counted dental visit however finally give nerve go see real dentist first even floss teeth brushing equated could home second end visit freaking dipped finger vaseline rubbed mouth wtf parent convinced childhood dentist taking patient take husband patient really good dentist little tough wa visiting regularly around 2008 regular flossing lightly sprayed face water wa convinced cavity eek haha wa terrified going see last week told genuinely worried disappointing disappointing parent lol said wa mad gone dentist since 2013 got said teeth looked great need floss regularly course idea managed cavity life lucky guess,dentist 7 year finally got gumption go back childhood dentist pleased say still cavity free 31,bushy eye

"I became a driver trainer for a trucking company and hit 5 years sober, and yet nobody seems to care.","Like the title says, hit 5 years sober back on August 23rd, and became a trainer at the beginning of August for my company. My wife said that I did a god job at becoming a trainer, but doesn’t seem interested in the next step in my career. 

Since becoming a trucker, I’ve lost contact with the few friends I did have, and now I just drive and go home. Becoming a trainer in my company is kind of a big deal as they don’t let anybody become one. Have to get a few recommendations beforehand. 

As far as 5 years sober, does it really matter if nobody cares if I’m a drunk or not anymore? It does to me, and it’s one of the very few things I’m proud of in my life.

"If the choice were up to you, would you choose for humanity to cease every non-essential activity/industry in the name of environmental conservation?","This is a thought experiment inspired by the fact that the international quarantine efforts have also had the effect of reducing our environmental impact at least for as long as the lockdown lasts.

By ""essential"" I mean activities or things that humans need to survive and function on a basic level, so healthcare, basic nutritionally sufficient food, water, education, things like that. Those would be the only things you're allowed to do or have in this situation. So no movies or TV shows, gaming, toys, luxury items or ""status symbols"", decorations, Reddit, etc. Basically no more entertainment or luxury. Things that already exist can still be used, but not if they require constant energy input (like non-essential websites or gaming consoles), and when they break, they much be disposed of in the least environmentally impactful way possible, but the main point is that we would no longer spend resources on making any more of them. Humanity would basically become as frugal as possible. This wouldn't be returning to when humanity had no technology (that would actually increase our environmental impact and also cause needless suffering), but simply using and developing technology only in ways that aid our survival, nothing else.

By eliminating the things we don't absolutely need, our environmental footprint would go way down, which would obviously be beneficial for the Earth and reduce the probability that humanity destroys itself by destroying the world we live in. Life would be dull in this scenario, and we'd basically be saying good bye to the modern entertainment saturated lifestyle enjoyed by many people, possibly forever. But in exchange we'd be giving us as a species the best shot at not going extinct from our own actions by reducing our actions to only those we can't live without. It would also have the secondary effect of allowing us to focus our resources on things we actually need.

If hypothetically you could, would you choose to live in a world like this? What do you think of it?

Greetings again! I hope you all had a good day!,"Hello there! It me again! The stranger who failed to stay asleep and woke up with a mouth sore! I hate to be that person but I'm once again failing to sleep. It's 1 am and I obviously can't tell myself that the pull chain on my ceiling fan is just reacting to physics and that things can go bump in the night with 4 pets.... 🤦‍♀️

I sleep with a hamster in my room, they are nocturnal creatures so of corse she likes to horde and run on her wheel at night. The pull chain is a long string which can obviously be manipulated by the fan's movement. I know these things yet my instincts yell, ""Nope! Keep the lamp on!""

And for an update on the sore, I tried applying Alum but found that the sore was big enough to cause my teeth to irritate it enough. I found that it had started bleeding (sore for the gore...). My mom found some medication to help with the pain and find the best way to get it to heal. Go mom! I now have a slightly swollen lip and I have no more Dr. Pepper for tomorrow... I'll have to ask my brother for a coffee if I'm actually going to stay up like a coward, is it okay to sleep with the covers over my face?


Still, I hope everyone had a good day like you all deserve! Feel free to chat about it! I'm not giving in to sleep just yet!

Weird dreams,"Alright, So I keep having these dreams of where I go into different timelines or places in the world. Example: Grand Canyon, a jungle, medieval times, and so in these dreams different scenarios happen. It's like a story almost plot twists, non-fiction. Once you die you restart a new life in a new place.. whenever you do die it tells you where you're going to go. I died 2 times in my dream by a rushing huge river. They're so scary they make me cry, but yet so addicting?? I can't explain the fear. I think it's with my fascination of past lives, traveling the world n' stuff. I don't know why I have these dreams they make me tear up, because I die in them.. and restart a new life. Am I afraid of dying or the thought of having a past life? I like my friends, family, my appearance. I like me. I don't want me to end. And I wonder where we go when we die. Afterlife? A new life? Do we just... not exist anymore?

It is so adorable to see famous people being loyal to their partners,"Sometimes it feels like life is beyond complicated for no reason and it feels like I might be missing out on things, but then you see even richest and most successful people live family life and despite money and being able to spend it on other things, they decided to have family and love in their life. That restores some hope in humanity and I think it is so beautiful. Those people mostly push their career higher and are most stable people. Best example is Lebron James, but there is also Robert Lewandowski I just saw posting online picture with his family and many actors and so on...

Happy sad A lot on my mind!,"I’m kind of sentimental...
I’ve been breaking some of my bad cycles lately, and it feels nice, a wee bit ago I stopped myself from slipping into a cycle I used to fall into. I’m glad at that, just need to fix my attention span and internet addiction haha.

I’ll be 20 soon... but I feel like I haven’t accomplished anything, but part of me knows how far I’ve come. Ah it’s confusing. 

I apply for uni soon, and I know I’ll make it in but at the same time I have no hope that I will... it’s fun! Well not really but I’m trying to cope. 

A change I’ve noticed lately is that I find my actually considering getting into a relationship... which is weird since I’ve said no to people since I don’t date. And it’s really confusing. I find myself thinking of adventures we’d have but then snap back and tell myself I still have tons to study and improve and that I should just forget it. An old friend has been rather.. well they said I looked good (in stronger language) and that if distance was lesser they’d come.. that had me feel weirder. Any one experienced that?

I'm 28. How are you doing 1991-92 babies?,"Hello. I'm a 28 year old guy and thought I would check in with others my age. I don't talk with people my age anymore as they're either early twenties or thirties and over. How is life for you?  


I graduated with a (useless) liberal arts degree and am currently working in retail until I save enough money to move to Japan to teach English (I've done this work before, just not in Japan. As for why I'm not teaching now, it's complicated). I still don't have real friends that I can call up and hang out with, and I've only had a few romantic relationships (more like ""flings""). I'm afraid of getting older because I want to actually experience my twenties, make friends with people in their twenties, date people in their twenties, be young and go to college parties instead of having nerd parties living with parents. But unfortunately age 24-28 has been marked by multiple setbacks and mental illness that I'm still dealing with. Quarantine has been hard for me because I want to finally ""get out there"" and ""leave my comfort zone"" as I've been kind of a hermit my whole life, and then this happens. But I've been trying to keep busy with video games, studying Japanese, playing my bass, fantasizing about playing guitar again, and just going to work though I don't quite like it.

"Reddit randomly revealed my face, without me wanting to","Alright, let's go about two years back in time to explain this. I had been texting a person on reddit for quite a long time, and they started to ask me to show a pic of myself. I had a freshly created, blank Reddit account, so I just updated my profile picture with an image of myself, I let her see it, and then I removed it (because I wanted my account to be anonymous). I thought that would have been it, to be honest.

My profile picture has remained blank ever since, I don't know why, but I never bothered to add one haha

Skipping forward to today, I wrote a comment on a post of one of my reddit friends. He then messaged me, saying there was something strange: ""I got a notification with an image of someone on it, is that you?"" He sends me the screenshot, and YES, in the notification he got from my comment, you could see that image in my profile icon, without me ever adding it! I was quite shocked, I usually very rarely send pics of myself to people I meet online, and Reddit just did it without me wanting to! This is so creepy, I'm assuming the image has always been on the servers, and there was some kind of bug?



Also, just to make it clear, it wasn't that big of a deal. I would have eventually revealed my face too (all my other reddit friends did), and in the end, you know, it's just a face. But this really made me think: what we post on the internet, is truly forever, it won't disappear! Even if we delete it, it'll still be on some server somewhere!

Moral of the story: REALLY pay attention to what you post online, because it's nearly impossible to completely get rid of it, once you do.

I let someone hug me for the first time today in 8 years and it felt so good I cried.,"Long story short, I was bullied by almost the entirety of my 7th grade class (there were 9 of us and 5 of them bullied me). Because of some events that happened over the months I refused to let my parents, family, and friends hug me. I’d slink away or do what my friends dubbed a “penguin hug” and only put my chin on their shoulders. 

Today I visited one of my best and only friends from high school, and she is very respectful of my boundaries when it comes to hugs and whatnot. Before I left, she wanted to say goodbye and started a hug but retracted it, but I said “you know what? Go for it.” And she hugged me, I hugged her, for a good minute. I was so happy. I actually hugged someone. And I let her hug me. I cried. Hugs feel so good. I can’t wait to give my parents a hug later tonight.

Obligatory Redditor’s Edit: I woke up this morning to so many people touched and moved about my story. I read every one of your comments, and your stories/comments were all so sweet and kind.

An antisocial freak who couldn't read or write got into the top school,"I was never a studious child. No matter how hard I tried I just couldn't get my grades up, it was like that ever since I started school. I was even asked to repeat a grade when I was 5, because I couldn't read or write properly when most of the class could. Math was a pain and still is lol. My childhood had been taken away so I could focus more on studying and being a better student. I yearned for what other kids had. They had the grades, they had extra curricular activities and they were having fun. They *liked* school. I couldn't understand how they did all that at once. My teachers would yell at me and I was never chosen for anything. This  resulted in terrible social anxiety, which affected my confidence alot. I couldn't even order food without nearly bursting into tears. So I became known as the quiet kid who wasn't even good at her studies.

I always wondered, just what is wrong with me? I try so hard but nothing ever works. I've done everything, extra classes, online tutors, and staying up all night. I couldn't understand it, just why was I never successful? 

By the time 7th grade rolled around, all my classmates left the school so they could go to better schools with bigger names. They all wanted to attend the best school in the country, let's call it ""The It School"". Now, this school was incredibly hard to get into. Even class toppers who applied didn't get in. Thousands of admissions yet only 80 or less got in.  Everyone always wondered, what is it that this school looks for in a student? What is the perfect student for them? That school created a whole market because tutors were there specifically to help kids get in, and most didn't. It was a rat race for that school. 

As I said before, most of the applications are rejected, so everyone applies to different schools with big names but not as big as The It School. My classmates left me, and in was the only one there at my old school which was very small. I still sucked at studying but by 7th grade, my grades were average. Bs and Cs filled my report card with the occasional A. 

Now, 8th grade was a nightmare, I was bullied relentlessly for things I didn't do and rumours were spread about me. This affected my grades terribly and i failed in several subjects including math. I was broken that year. Shattered. 

However, after bullying was over, a spark was lit inside of me. A spark of determination. The next year, I topped each subject, 100 marks in every paper. I turned my life around and won speech competition after speech competition. My anxiety left me entirely. 

Now, the examinations for The It School rolled around, but were postponed sheveral times due to the virus. This year, for the first time, the school changed its criteria. They had always just looked at the entry test results. There was no test this time. It was based purely on luck and a record. I'm telling you, this was the time everyone wished they had done their assignments!

Anyway, just like any other year, 2000+ people submitted their records and just prayed they'd get in. And when the admissions list was put up, most of the city's kids cried. The reason? There were only 20 names on that list. 

Including mine. 


As soon as the list was up, relatives I didn't even know congratulated me. My old classmates who I hadn't spoken to in years had reached out to me and started talking about how I was 'so lucky!!' to have gotten in. Gifts were sent to my house, and boy did I feast on all the cakes sent to me. My dad's co-workers were calling him one after the other to congratulate him on this. Word spread like wildfire.

To be honest, all that attention felt fantastic. After being the stupid kid for nearly all my life, it feels amazing to be showered with praise. To all the kids who struggled just like me: you can do it. We all can do it. Your potential is like a hidden goldmine, untapped. It isn't exactly about working hard, it is about working smart. Find the teaching method that suits YOU. Like Einstein once said, ""Everybody is a genius, but if you judge a fish on it's ability to climb a tree, it will live it's whole life believing that it's stupid. 

I wish everyone the best of luck, and if you've read it this far, thanks for listening to my story. Now I'm just praying I get into med school :D

"Of all the career risks I’ve taken, running a band has been the most helpful and healthiest so far.","I’m young to some but 30 has shed some light on this opportunity I reluctantly funded in my early 20’s (honestly almost forgot about it). This 3 piece ‘rock’ band had zero people listening to what I would call a “tried and true” rendition of popular soft rock mixed with a touch of funk influence, (I didn’t care if they didn’t make it, this was my half-ass attempt to manage a band. I’ve always wanted to) but I liked what I heard and I thought it was worth the couple bills to see what they could do.
Let’s call it 5 yrs ago (no record before signing up with them), I helped fund their recordings and merchandise. That was the agreement. All they wanted me there for, right?

WRONG!

I’ll never forget the first jam they had with me present. I ended up sweaty and high off adrenaline from ‘jammin’ on drums with them. Loved the rush and can’t express enough about how positive their connection felt while playing with these established musicians.
Let it be known that my sole goal was to work with them so’s to shove me up there so I can talk with  other, more established artists (hopefully manage). I really don’t have a clue what it takes to make quality music. 

Well tell you what, I can. This 3 piece helped me better understand what I want from music and overall companionship. My favourite experience as an ‘important part’ to the writing process was the in-depth, co-operative feedback we all had for ideas. Like.. let me tell you, when I had a thought to share about a song or idea for whatever (video, promo, post), it was eaten up like hyenas fighting over (what I thought was) a meatless carcass... The fun poked at it, the ‘cringey’ relatable experiences shared and jokes about how true it felt to identify as an unsuccessful part of a band was refreshing as it was confusing. (Didn’t know they were so hard on themselves, learned a lot about them)

I joined this business operating as a ‘casual director/funder’ in a sense, so I could climb my way to a managing position for an upcoming, bigger, better band. 
What I learned about investing in little projects like this is that ‘the experience I prepared for is not what the experience had in mind/store for me’

Proud is how I felt during and after the band’s success.

I overheard a mother disciplining her sons today.,"I sat on a bench in my town when a mother with her two young sons came walking by. Across the street there was a fat man, walking and minding his business. 

The older one of the boys said to his brother 'Hey, look' and pointed his finger at the man. The mother immediately told him to put his finger down and to cut it out. She said that she didn't raise him like this and that every person is different and to not do that again. 

I, an almost fat person myself, smiled at her, she nodded her head at me and I just wanted to tell her that she was a good mother, but she already went her way.

I think I found what I wanna do for the next few years of my life.,"I’m currently taking a gap year before going to the military (mandatory 3 years), and right now I’m taking a course of how to be a wilderness tour guide for schools and hikers, and I’m loving it.

If you asked me “what do you wanna do when you grow up?” Or “what are your plans after you finish your service?” Half a year ago I would tell you that I have no fucking clue.
But now I feel like this is what I wanna do. After my military service I’m gonna go and get my tour guide certificate, and thats what I’m gonna do for at least a few years.

"I love surfing, but live 1000 miles away from the nearst ocean.","I was in Hawaii a few years ago and I tried surfing for the first time. I'm not sure what the typical beginner experience is, but these waves weren't too big at all. Big enough to surf, but not so big that a beginner like me wouldn't be able to ride them. It was probably one of the most fun things I've ever done. Every ocean I've been even remotely close to since then, I've always attempted to go surfing (to varying degrees of success) because it is so damn fun.

The problem with all of this is that I'm from the midwest, where the waves are so big that they had to build the cities 1000 miles from the nearest coastline, surfing isn't something I can do regularly out here. I go surfing once or twice a year. I've been making it a point to save some money and make it out to an ocean at least once a year.

This seems like a problem that will hopefully go away soon, as life is currently presenting me with an opportunity to jump ship out here and move to California (relatively) soon.

Whenever I meet someone from the coast that doesn't surf, it annoys me a little bit. Like these people have lived their whole lives near a perfectly surfable ocean and yet they have not deemed those perfectly good waves worthy of catching. &gt;:( I know it's not for everyone but god damn everyone should at least try it!",AXxi0S,0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/CasualConversation/comments/ingrx4/i_love_surfing_but_live_1000_miles_away_from_the/,wa hawaii year ago tried surfing first time sure typical beginner experience wave big big enough surf big beginner like able ride wa probably one fun thing ever done every ocean even remotely close since always attempted go surfing varying degree success damn fun problem midwest wave big build city 1000 mile nearest coastline surfing something regularly go surfing twice year making point save money make ocean least year seems like problem hopefully go away soon life currently presenting opportunity jump ship move california relatively soon whenever meet someone coast surf annoys little bit like people lived whole life near perfectly surfable ocean yet deemed perfectly good wave worthy catching gt know everyone god damn everyone least try,love surfing live 1000 mile away nearst ocean,xxi 0

I'm about to work my longest work week ever,"For a little bit of background, I work part-time at a grocery store.

Could the Toys in Toy Story cut open a stuffed animal and climb inside the stuffing and use it as a moving Trojan horse?,"
Also how do toys die? What if they’re broken into a bunch of little pieces? Will they live on as little bits of material and suffer?

Could they eventually be broken down into their smallest form of existence and finally lose consciousness? Or would they still live on for eternity?

Could they be melted? What if they changed their state of matter and became something other than a solid? Would they continue to live as a liquid or gas or would they not feel anything anymore? Would the suffering end? Would they continue living on in a torturous life of grueling boredom and agonizing pain until the sun finally collides with earth, devouring the planet whole?

Would being vaporized by a massive flaming gas giant finally end them? Could they reach peace?

Reddit is what you make it. I used to be on questionable subs and when i started to distance myself from these. I started to realise how wholesome and nice Reddit can be. Of course there's still people who farm Karma or just act stupid and mean but for the most of it i've seen great posts about life changing advices or stories that made me grow up and mature a bit slowly or just watch memes wich is also great. But to think that this is one of the only places where over sexualised teenagers or models arent the main thing and it still gets talked down by media is annoying and honestly dissapointing. Maybe im the only who thinks this but i'd be glad to hear what other people think about what i had to say.

Crazy how life just passes by,"Hi, I'm a single man, 27. Was drinking my hard worked Saturday beer and listened to a very nostalgic song for me. It made me remember the time I moved to another city to study on a public university (believe me, it is very hard to get on one of those in my country and it is very respectable to study on these unis here, something like the Ivy League there in america). I've finished the course but in the middle of it I realized it was not my thing. Talked to my parents who invested time and money for me getting there, so they convinced me to finish it. Well, I finished and never had the opportunity nor the love to pursue a career in it (Civil Engineering, very very hard course, which only its conclusion was a pain in the ass). Came back to my city, after 6 years there. Went when I was 18-19, concluded with 24, going through a hard depression at the time and growing up in general. I've maturated a lot there.

So I graduated and came back to live with my mother. Went unemployed a long time, even with that beautiful public uni diploma. I was grown on that mindset, that only the diploma mattered. It destroyed me, but today I've went through it. Now I'm completing one year employed, yet living with my mother, but the situation is completely different. I plan to move out yet this year if things continue going the way they are.

So today I remembered those living alone times and came to the conclusion how things pass. It has been more than 2 years that i've graduated. The only thing that remains is my diploma and friends I made along the way. I did not retained much of knowledge about civil engineering. It was never my thing. My father, who pursued me to finish it, is really nice with me, but shows no signs of regret about the day I told him to visit me and talk about my dissatisfaction in general.  My family have too put all of that under the carpet. Seems like another life I've lived. I work in administration/accounting field, because of experience with numbers and excel in general, maybe one of few things my graduation gave me. 

So I caught my self thinking how things passed by. That time I was ashamed that so many people put expectations on me and I've failed to deliver. Now seems that even I've started to forget about, as things moved on. I've started a new course on technology/programming area, something that I discovered myself last year. I came to terms with my parents in general, after being unemployed for a time. I know i'm still a disappointment to some of my relatives and even my parents. But I've managed to get over it and have hope to make my on life and be able to help them soon enough. Even now, with a job that don't live up with their (and even mine) expectations, I'm able to give some help where I can.

Well, to finish off this vent out, I want to all you people get the following message: are you dissatisfied with your graduation/job field? Quit it then. Do not force something you know you don't like. I was young and a very manipulated person, specially by my parents. They've done wrong to me yes, but I have my part of the blame too. At least I learnt that I will never put my son in these type of situation. People have the right to live their on dreams, not the dreams of others, even if that 'others' are their parents or grandparents. That f*cked me up for a long time.

Ever wish you could forget someone?,"There was this girl that went to my school. And she was so damn pretty. Like, I had a crush on her four three years since 8th grade. We sometimes texted each other via Instagram, but we never went anywhere, and we never talked Irl.

She moved away over the summer, and I still follow her Instagram. I’m trying to hard to forget her. But I also don’t want to unfollow her, because I want to see how she turns out in the end.

I sometimes look at her stories, and she is still pretty as ever. I used to feel lust for her, but now I just feel sadness. Everything has slowly gone downhill for me, some of it caused by COVID and some not.

I often think about suicide, and how easy it would be to just end it. But I want to stay alive.

I used to think I had a chance with her. But with her being at a new school, I often feel jealous for everyone who gets to see her walk through he halls, watch her change her hair and clothes throughout the year, and for whatever lucky guy ends up with her.

I’m not looking for advice here. I know where to go for that.

In so far as I can tell now: the devs wanted to get on a list of terrible video game controlls. Congratulations Devs of that game you are now on that list. Tank style controll from the 90s that flip flop around. But also the plot is basically I'm a investigator. someone says something weird is in this house. And it has the worse electrical wiring, how else do we explain that despite what look like a million and one light bulbs, none of them are on? And I won't bring anything useful to defend myself, or bring a crap load of back up?.

Wouldn't you want be wearing a powered armor suit by now? And how come people don't  like her know when to show up? did someone on her team tell them? oO

Resident Evil Series: So we can make zombies, and we know thats bad. Lets do it again anyway!

I caught a scammer pretending to be my friend today,"So, for a while now I thought my friend, we'll call A, had two instagram accounts and just switched between them once in a while. But, the second account, As, was kinda suspicious since the first time it messaged me. It had awful grammar, compared to my friend who always had perfect grammar. Honestly, a month ago that was the only information I had to go off and I just assumed that it was my friend but writing lazier than usual.

Fast forward to today. I often ask my friends to look over assignments I do to see if they make sense and answer the questions asked. I messaged As asking for help and it said ok. About 5 hours later I had no response so I messaged A and As if they got it and A said no.

I showed the email I sent my work to and A said that she didn't have that email, only a similar one she hasn't used in years. Then we got suspicious and found that As was an impersonator. I asked A some questions like favorite color (pink), my favorite band (MCR), if she had a sister (no).

I asked As the same questions and she only got MCR right. As even tried saying that she had a half sister and wanted to go to colorado and learn Portuguese.

We reported the account and I have no idea who it is. It may be some old creep thinking I'm a girl and wanting to kidnap me. I don't know, but I feel proud. We reported the account and hopefully all works out. It was weird.

So yeah, that was crazy. I'm glad I caught the scammer. Thanks for reading!

Today I managed to motivate by favourite professor.,"Hello folks. I hope all of you are doing good.

It is the 5th of September today. Which, in our country, is celebrated as Teachers’ day. You will come across various students posting statuses, pictures, and videos dedicating to their respective teachers as all of our educational institutions are currently shut and nobody is able to personally visit their teachers to thank them. Even social media today is filled with similar posts and pictures.

I felt the same urge to thank somebody who I rate highly. He is such a gem of a person that I could go on and on talking about him for hours and I won't be tired. He has helped me immensely not only in the subject which he teaches but also in shaping the way that I think about stuff in my life.

Anyway, so I decided to send him a short message expressing what I thought about him and how well he has been doing his job of being an excellent teacher to me. What he did next was something that I wasn’t really expecting or even prepared for. He replied to my text after a short while saying how thankful he was for my kind words and then immediately proceeded to take a screenshot of my message and posted it on his profile with a caption that said *“****So motivating.****”*.

I was in awe and had to take my time to process all of it. He has never done anything like that for anyone else to this day, which was very apparent when my college mates started texting me saying how lucky I was to be complimented from a professor of his stature.

"I stood up for myself to my friends for the first time ever, and I just needed to tell someone","I'm a 26 year old woman and have been friends with the same group of people since we were in middle school. These girls have known me all my life. We used to be huge bullies in high school, just because we had bigger tits and we cursed like sailors. I've since reached out to most of the kids I bullied and apologized. I'm not saying this to prove anything, I should've apologized then - scratch that, I shouldn't have bullied them then. Some of these girls never grew out of that, though. They are still huge bullies. They call it being confident and sure of themselves, but if you have to be rude to get ahead - that's not confidence. That's weakness. 

Anyways, I've gone from being outgoing and loud and extroverted to a miserable introverted antisocial person. I keep to myself, I don't ever go out and especially since the pandemic I have stayed home as much as humanly possible to the detriment of my mental health. Just because I live with people over 60. My friends now want to celebrate one's engagement, and they have been hammering me about going to their party. I think it's irresponsible to go to a club that is underground with no windows with 10+ people, all in their mid 20's who I'm sure have not been following any sort of guidelines and have been travelling and partying and sleeping around the past few months because...""OMG YOLO FOMO""... 

I have been called a pussy. 

I have sent voice messages on our WhatApp group chat and they tell me they don't have the patience to listen to my annoying whiny excuses. 

One of them told me I didn't care about them and only care about looking smart. Uhm... WHAT?

I finally had enough and lost my shit today. I went off on them, even though they still told me I was overreacting and that they didn't mean anything by those and we're friends and friends joke around. 

Honestly, at some point, I became the punching bag of this group and I'm sick of it. 

I might be overreacting to this pandemic, I might be over-doing it, I might be a pussy, but I sure as hell am done with taking their bullshit.

I got a lot of things done today and I feel really proud of myself.,"I (18F) woke up quite early today, but I got ready a bit later as I planned to go on a walk, because for the first time in a few days it's finally not raining where I live and that makes me a bit happy. I wasn't sure if I'd get anything else done today, but then I remembered that my little sister asked me to cook something with broccoli the other day. I don't actually cook regularly at all, I think the last time was a few months ago. I hate my own cooking and I know how to make 3 things maybe.

So I went to buy groceries, decided that I want to make some broccoli cream soup as my mum makes it sometimes and it seems quite easy, so I asked her about it and most of the process is just boiling broccoli in water.

When I came home, I put the broccoli to cook and I put some clothes to wash. Then I decided that I'd clean around the house.  This I never really do either, unless they ask me. I'm not very close to my family so I don't like cleaning up after them.

I took everything out of the fridge including its compartments, and started cleaning the inside of the fridge. Then I went and washed the parts that I took out, patted them dry and I put them back in.

I then checked what needed to be thrown away from the food items that I took out of the fridge and put the rest of them back in a nice and organised way. I haven't seen my fridge like that in a while. 

I then finished the broccoli soup, and I was actually surprised because my sisters both really liked it, even though they had to ask me to give them more salt twice.

I also washed some dishes, cleaned the dining table and some other things in the kitchen, put my laundry out to dry and folded some other clothes too. I then went to my room and cleaned a bit there too, made my bed etc.

I had been feeling down for the last few days and I don't think I ever had such a productive day while I was feeling this way.

I just had a near death experience and I need to talk ad get it out of my system,"well, it happened like 3-4 hours ago,

I was driving my car when I came across a road jam that I knew would not open for at least the next 30-45 minutes, so i decided to take a dirt track shortcut that I knew about and also knew was empty

I was going about 60-70 on the dirt track, which admittedly is too fast for that road and is my fault, I was halfway through the dirt track when a dog (trying to chase my car) jumped in front of it and I instinctively swerved the car to the right, where there is wild shrubbery and construction debris, before the car rammed or hit something though, I turned the wheel completely to the other side and and tried braking, but the road was extremely bumpy and right as I was about to brake, the car bumped and my foot shifted enough for me to miss the brake pedal ( not sure if it important, but I was driving a manual transmission car )

so the car didn't stop and started going the other side to the left where there was a pillar supporting a bridge and a river right next to it, My brain was already in super panic mode by this time and I could see the car was gonna ram into the pillar, on reflex or by sheer dumb luck, I don't know, I somehow managed to stop the car 2-3 meters before the pillar at which point my heart was beating so fast I could actually hear it beating normally

It really made me realize how fickle life can turn suddenly and boy am I glad to have come out safe and unscratched .

I'm 15 and I still have an imagination... is this okay?,"Not just some small imagination world but a large developed imagination universe filled up with history, sports, politics, tv shows and movies, video games, music, and basically anything else. I feel like for a 15 year old who's currently learning how to drive and is in 10th grade it is super immature to have something like this but I feel like I can't help it. Usually every day I'll either ride my bike or bounce a basketball by myself and escape into this place. I'll add details to this imagination like maybe one day I'll create a crazy president who was super controversial or an underdog sports team winning the championship. This place is my escape from the real world and helps me deal with stress and help me feel so relaxed. It all started when I was fourth grade, I thought it was just a fun little thing to do but quickly became a hobby. I think a comparison to it is like a kid playing with his toys, however the difference is I never grew out of it. I feel ashamed about my imagination but it nevers gets in the way of my school work or my other hobbies. I guess its similar to either people who meditate or do yoga to relieve stress. This is the first time I ever shared or talked about this, if anybody from my life ever found out about this I would be so embarrassed.

Entire student dorm to myself,"So I just began renting a student dorm, in a block there's different sections, and each section there's 5 dorms and a communal kitchen. Booking times for my accommodation were 7 to 8 am. I joined the Facebook group to find a flock of students discussing group chats for their dorms or block to connect with their roommates.

I'm quite excited to meet new people, which is why I bothered paying for private dorms in the first place rather than just living at home with my parents despite the fact that I'm barely that far away from my parent's house to begin with.

It's now currently 8:22 PM and nobody has shown up to my particular section and I'm the only dorm in use. I know it's not just incredibly shy people who haven't come out their room yet because a paper slip with information is lodged into the side of the doors and falls when you first open the door.

I have an entire kitchen to myself, I don't really know what's happening and I hope to fucking God I have roommates at some point, it feels really weird having an entire day to kill with nothing to do.

Before you suggest I go downstairs and mingle you need to really think about that concept yourself. Nobody just waltz over to a random group of people and joins in the conversation in the communal areas, the only real way you make friends properly is by establishing a group and then socialising. Once a group has already been established, you don't just add yourself to that group, it becomes weirdly hard and they'd most likely just ignore you.

What's frustrating, is that my ""group"" is currently missing. I have the entire floor to myself. Nobody is here. I shower with the door unlocked and sometimes take trips to the kitchen with music playing out loud or barefooted or whatever the fuck because I know nobody is going to come in.

I'm kind of lonely.

I despise Robby from Cobra Kai (Spoilers),"I don’t really know how to explain it, but the more the show tried to turn him into a good person, I just hated him even more. It’s his own fault his dad doesn’t like him, you see in the first episode he treated his dad like shit. And if he realized that he was the reason his dad doesn’t like him, than he wouldn’t look for a father figure in Daniel. And the point still stands that Robby only went to Daniel to piss off his dad. Miguel won the karate tournament fair and square, it’s perfectly honorable to use someone’s weakness to beat them. He went in with an injured shoulder, which was entirely his own fault. Yes, Miguel shouldn’t have punched him at that party, but at that point I didn’t like him so I felt no sympathy for his character. His relationship with Sam was a mistake at best, and I find it extremely frustrating that they tore down Miguel to shed this asshole in better light. If you argue that his dad was a deadbeat, then you have to realize that he doesn’t like his dad because he’s POOR. It was extremely shallow for him to see Daniel as a better person just because he has more money. Rant over.

I woke up from my most vivid sleep paralysis experience and I can't stop thinking about it.,"I just moved into an apartment near my campus where reviews were poor and very bizarre things have occurred (rent's cheap). It's a studio apartment but I managed to place a futon and full size bed in there comfortably. This morning was the start of my second weekend here. I remember waking up naturally around 6AM then turning on my back to rest my eyes for a bit (this position gives me sleep paralysis 11 times out of 10). I didn't mean to fall back asleep, but it happened anyways. 

I then heard a knocking at my front door. My eyes opened but I couldn't make much sense of my surroundings. Soon after I heard my door open then quickly shut. This is when my heart began to beat out of my chest - I could not manage to lift my head to see who just opened my door! I heard vivid footsteps walk to the side of my bed, then to the kitchen, around, and then onto the futon. Once this auditory hallucination was on the futon, it began rummaging and turning, as if it were trying to get comfortable. 

Mindful breathing slowly helped me wake up. As soon as I woke I could feel my back drenched in sweat as well as my heart continuing it's drumming. I quickly got up and looked over the futon - nothing. This is my first sleep paralysis where I've felt the presence of something else.

I just left my job... Now I have to figure out how to pay my 5 moths of debt xd,"Well... Before the quarantine I have a job in a restaurant.

Three days ago, my boss call me to work after 4 month without working at all, and during that time I could'nt pay my rent, but the owner of the house was kinda cool and he told me to pay when all the situation of the quarantine ends.

So... The firts day of job was ok.

The second was mess up because no one expect the amount of client that came to the restaurant, and it was stressful 'cause they were only three employees in the restaurant, two in the kitchen, me in the public. We would'be fine with two persons.

The third day (this one), they told me that other person would be with me, but doesn't came early.

Today, came like 8 tables: the kitchen was a mess. The tables kinda too. And the stress was to much, but I was trying to not be stressfull so the others can be relax at least to me.

The restaurant have two floors, and in some part, the kitchen and the second floor are connected (that place was the site of the guy who makes juices and lemonades and stuff), and I was there preparing four glass of water, and I ask to my partners to give a towel to dry on the glass of water. They ignore me, I ask again and ignore me again. Then, one of the cheft ask me about something that was in that part where I was, and I pass the thing to him, and ask him again about a towel. He call the other guy in the kitchen to pass me napkins, and the guy throw me a pack of napskin in the face.

In that point I was mad and stressed about the whole disorganization of the restaurant that it's fault of the bosses for being lazy in many ways.

So, in that point I just tell the guy that throw the pack in the face that what's his f-- problem, and he told me that he's stress and doing stuff and bla... bla...

In that point, I just take of my uniform and left the job with the 8 tables awaiting being served.

It doesn't felt pleassure. I just felt anger, and I felt like wanna hit something or someone. 

But now I'm calm... And I'm not happy, but I'm glad to have left that place before I kill someone.

Now... I have to find another job xd

Meaby I'll be mess up for my own fault. But I'll be ok in the future.

Of course, on one hand, this whole thing has been a true and altruistic rest of human relations, but on the other side, the added financial, spacial, and mental stress of this pandemic/lockdowns is a sadly unneeded stress to many otherwise great relationships.

"I’ve (30sF) been down about COVID WFH, but then I realized all the personal benefits I’ve had.","On mobile. I’ve been home for 6+ months. I’m normally a very social person and enjoyed my work and personal life. I’ve been really itching to go back to work but there’s no end in sight so far. Sometimes I get real down thinking about much I miss my old life and friends. But then I started thinking about what good things the COVID pandemic has done for me. My skin wasn’t in the best of shape. I stopped wearing make up and started a skincare routine that has changed my skin drastically. I stopped using heat on my hair and have been keeping it in wet braids overnight, thus beautiful beach wavy hair. It’s grown so long too, which is what I’ve always wanted.  I’ve spent more time outdoors so my skin has a nice color to it (using spf of course.) I started working out and longer walks with my dogs almost every day. I have a beautiful collection of indoor plants that is a now newish hobby to occupy my time; it’s thriving and I never knew I had this interest. Overall I guess my point is, I’m feeling so good about myself lately! I am feeling more natural beauty instead of the processed business woman I was before. It’s just really refreshing. The COVID has definitely caused me some anxiety I have never had before, and I finally reach out for professional help, so that I could feel normal again and just..go out (still working on that though.)

Apparently I look considerable older than I am.,"This just happened and I needed to vent. For context, I am 24 and my Brother-in-law is 27. 

During lockdown, my BiL has done a lot of DIY, he's completely revamped his bedroom, and this meant there was a lot of waste. 

I have a big car, so I offered to load it up and drive him and the stuff to the local recycling centre, so we booked a slot for this morning, filled up the car, and headed off to dispose of all his crap. 

Now the rules for the recycling centre are that only one person can unload stuff, due to Covid, so I stayed in the car to start off with while my BiL unloaded. The employee who was helping us then said that I could come out and help, as there was a lot of stuff, so I dutifully popped on my mask and started to unload the car. 

At which point the employee looked at us and said ""aww it's nice to see a mother taking her son out"". 

Now, I am 3 years younger than my brother in law. So we just stared at him for a second to process what he'd just said before o awkwardly stuttered out that he's my brother in law, not my son, and the employee just laughed and carried on. 

I'm still a little shocked/mad, I mean, there's a reason you shouldn't assume people's relationships.

Just sharing my awesome first day!!,"Yesterday was my first day as an English teacher at a secondary school. I have experience with teaching secondary school kids, but that was with a mentor at another school (so there was always someone helping me). This new class at my school was solely for refugees or children that just entered the country and needed to learn English. 

I was so nervous about my lessons that I couldn't pee, was sweating and moved too much. By the time the lesson ended, I said: the bell will ring in less than a minute, is there anything you want to ask or tell me? And then this really quiet girl responded:' Miss, you're gorgeous.'
Of course I was caught off guard and I don't really reply well to compliments. I was so happy though! Then the students left and another person said:' you're my favorite teacher.'

And that my fellow redditors.... MADE MY DAY!! 😭❤️

Today I realized that the connection between my favorite movies might be the soundtrack composers,"I always had a hard time finding movies I would end up liking and it always seemed so random. Today I was streaming the soundtracks of my favorite or memorable films and I was surprised how many of the soundtracks have the same composer. Some of these composers are also known to work together. 

I do have favorite directors but I always found it strange that I could love a movie directed by one and dislike the rest of his filmography. Turns out I should pick my movies based on the composers.

It seems that composers tend to choose movies that let their music have more impact. And of course the music is better if they feel they are working on something special.

So I can usually control my headaches and force them to go away or at least minimize the pain...unless they're migraines.,"Thought this might be useful to someone and was also thinking about posting it on a Medical related sub but they don't seem to take kindly to alternative medicine of sorts.

I don't consider it meditation (though I've never meditated before so maybe it is) but how I get rid of it requires a bit of imagination.

It's not always a cure for it either. I just sort of move the pain.

Basically when it's a sharp stabbing pain I close my eyes and focus on where it's located then imagine the pain being spread out. The idea of that is pretty much dilution. The more you spread the concentrated pain the less painful it becomes.

I usually imagine it spreading like a force field in movies or games that gradually wraps around something (in this case, my brain) and the sharp pain dulls.

I'm sometimes left with a dull but manageable headache that doesn't make me want to throw up whatever medicine I try to take or it goes away completely.

It doesn't work very well with migraines though. I can make the pain dissipate a little but it usually comes back unless I'm laser focused all the time.

This might not work for people who actually read this long ass post but it helps me out a lot.

NOTE: It requires ALL your focus over sometimes a long period of time. If you feel it working do *not* stop until you're sure it's at a level you can deal with. If you feel the pain starting to condense back where it came from then go back to focusing before it does.",NightStar79,2,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/CasualConversation/comments/imzq1m/so_i_can_usually_control_my_headaches_and_force/,thought might useful someone wa also thinking posting medical related sub seem take kindly alternative medicine sort consider meditation though never meditated maybe get rid requires bit imagination always cure either sort move pain basically sharp stabbing pain close eye focus located imagine pain spread idea pretty much dilution spread concentrated pain le painful becomes usually imagine spreading like force field movie game gradually wrap around something case brain sharp pain dulls sometimes left dull manageable headache make want throw whatever medicine try take go away completely work well migraine though make pain dissipate little usually come back unless laser focused time might work people actually read long post help lot note requires focus sometimes long period time feel working stop sure level deal feel pain starting condense back came go back focusing doe,usually control headache force go away least minimize pain unless migraine,night star 79

Lately my hygiene and my physical health have slipped a lot. My friend group was toxic and while I don't blame them for my own problems, they didn't help with my mental state. It was hard to build up the courage to stop talking with them because they have been the only people I've seen regularly for a long time, especially since lockdown happened. But today I decided to block all of them and I left and deleted our group chat that I've been in for a long time.

I have my therapist to thank for helping me find the strength to do that. I think it's a big step toward getting my life back on track. For some reason since I left the group chat I've felt a drive to start working out again as well as to keep myself clean. It's like I feel like I'm starting a new chapter in my life, a better one.

Anyone else have experience or advice for this kind of thing?",Dangman_Cometh,13,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/CasualConversation/comments/imprvn/i_left_my_toxic_friend_group_today_and_am_working/,23m never high self esteem much respect lately hygiene physical health slipped lot friend group wa toxic blame problem help mental state wa hard build courage stop talking people seen regularly long time especially since lockdown happened today decided block left deleted group chat long time therapist thank helping find strength think big step toward getting life back track reason since left group chat felt drive start working well keep clean like feel like starting new chapter life better one anyone else experience advice kind thing,left toxic friend group today working respecting,dang man cometh
genius eyebrow lift trick,"I just wanted to share how i got my eyebrows lifted without surgery.

I(F) have been cleaning up my own eyebrows for almost a year now and I've also been trying to lift them by just plucking the bottom, letting the top grow out and shaping it. i did this because i realized that the reason i looked so sad were my very droopy eyebrows. It actually works so i went to YouTube to see if other people have done this but i didn't see anything similar. It's either so well known that people don't feel the need to make a tutorial on it or Je suis un genius.😎😎

"As an F1 fan, I'm glad to see new and returning circuits added to the calendar.","F1 has been a little... weird this season. The pandemic caused many races to either be postponed or simply cancelled altogether, including the new Vietnam Grand Prix and the returning Dutch Grand Prix. The FIA did a great job of rescheduling some races, and eventually put together a solid calendar, which includes some new and returning tracks for this season. 

The new tracks are Mugello (Italy), Portimao (Portugal) and Bahrain Outer (Bahrain). Returning tracks are Imola (Italy), Nurburgring (Germany) and Istanbul Park (Turkey). I am very excited to see  lot of these tracks on the calendar, especially Istanbul Park and Portimao since I really like both these tracks. Bahrain Outer is going to be insane as well, as lap times in qualifying are expected to be as low as 55 seconds.

First of them merely changed a surround himself. Second of them, just has gone with his PC. He is became a social phobia. It became impossible to take conversation with him.

Last friend, just asshole. Some years ago i believed him and gave him a big loan. After that he stopped being my friend. I don't worrying about my loneliness at all. I will always find to do with myself. It can be playing PC, riding on bicycle, programming AVR, self-study of electronics etc. But sometimes i want to talk with anybody. I don't ashame to start conversation with stranger but i noticed that i haven't what to talk. But maybe just people doesn't know what to talk because they doesn't have a hobby?

I just had my first marching band show and it was absolutely awful. Yay!,"It was God awful. We missed notes, missed steps, ran onto each other and were out of time. It was a literal train wreck. But this is good. 2 months ago, if you gave me a bass drum and asked me to play it, 2 things would have happened- 1) I would have put it on and buckled at the knees. Those things are heavy, especially if you weigh under 100 pounds and have arms that are thinner than your drumsticks. 2) I would have bombed (in a bad way) the music. My form would be wrong, and the music would sound truly awful. I also learned how to march (aka fancy walking), something that's not super easy when your drum blocks half of your field of vision. We had half the practice time we usually have because of Covid, and one person described our show as ""the worst show in the history of our school."" But this is all good. Why? Because I was able to go from not knowing how to play or march to marching and playing in a show in front of a hundred or so people, and that's progress. And as that one almond milk commercial says, progress is perfection.

Gifted the first positivity jar today!,"Some time ago I posted about my good friends and mentioned that I'm doing custom positivity jars as a surprise for them.

In the end I decided to go for small tin containers instead of glass jars since they'd break too easily. Some are for pasta, some for spices and some are simply decorated with flowers (for the girls). Inside there is 1 letter addressed to the person and 365 notes (a mix of quotes, funny stuff, activities, compliments and memories). Also depending on the person I add food, a small object or leave it as is.

pet peeve about texting,"i'm a guy  
the person i'm talking about is also a guy

then in real life, when I see him again, he acts as if nothing happened

but I feel like there should be some sort of continuity between real life and texting, because both are forms of communication, regardlessit seems like mixed signals...but also it's a pet peeve of mine, i feel that if people never respond via text,they couldn't care lessam I going along with the wrong train of thought?

also, if someone takes 5 hours to respond to me, I should take 5 hours to respond back to them , right? cuz i thought friendships were give and take.  
They take 3 days to respond, I take 3 days to respond.

"To the stranger that knocked on my door to warn my about my neighbor garage on fire. Thank you, you did make the difference to avoid a horrible disaster.","3 days ago I was about to sleep and my next door neighbor is a garage where they make some welding. So around 10:30 pm I heard some noises, like some machines working and its pretty normal sometimes they work very late, tho I heard the sounds stronger that usual. So while I was just doing my stuff to sleep I hear my door knocking and I thought, wtf? who knocks the door at this hour. So I went to the door with caution and a guy tell me: Hey the next door garage is on fire! So I just grabbed some clothes and get out of the house. The stranger told me he already called 911 and he left. So I alert the other neighbors and they came out of their house just to be safe, police, firefighters arrived and turn off the fire. Good thing no one was hurt and it was only my neighbor garage that was damaged and not so bad. But for a moment I really thought that if the fire gets to my house it could have gotten really bad. The neighbor talked to me and he offered to pay all the damages on my wall, I told him we could go 50/50 but he insisted.

Im 100% convinced Apps like Facebook and Reddit are ALWAYS listening to our conversations.,"And they are doing a poor job of hiding it if they are still denying it. Ever so often I will be talking with my mom irl or my friends through discord. Sometimes we will just generally bring up topics of stuff and then all of a sudden an Ad will be for that thing. The first time it feels like a coincidence but it has happened many times. And the worst part is when this happens its from vocal conversations. If I look up cat food and get ADs for cat food I'm not surprised or anything. But sometimes I'm just talking with my family in the living room face to face and then BAM Ad for something specific we talked about. Usually on Facebook which I almost never use, so when it happens on there I notice.

Is this even legal? Like listening to 100% of our conversations in order to run custom ads? Another fantastic example is of Reddit. Recently I've been noticing that I've been seeing a subreddit called r/chloe on the ""popular feed"" or whatever its called here. It's some anime girl or something. I don't like anime so I paid it no mind. However I just realized why its always showing up. We recently got a new dog named Chloe...

However... even though I didn't get the outcome I wanted I'm still extremely proud of myself for standing up for what I want. Also it turns out I will get to move out with a friend soon anyway so I'm pretty content even though I don't get to live my boyfriend.

I absolutely adore when I say “I love you / I miss you” and the person on the receiving end says it back WITHOUT the added “too” on the end... (ie I miss you “too” vs I miss you).,"As the title says...and here’s a recent moment that made my heart flutter with happy. **&lt;3**

I’ve been reconnecting with a friend and in our conversation last night I text him “I’ve really missed you!” His response? “**I have missed you!**”

There’s something about it coming back in a slightly different variation and without that “too” on the end that makes it all the more special to me. I’ve wondered why I prefer it like this and feel that maybe there’s just more sincerity with it, and that it’s because they earnestly feel that way, not “in addition to my saying it” which I guess for me is what the “too” implies when it’s used. 

My heart is so content lately. I’m happy, and it’s been awhile since I’ve gotten these sweet sincere messages from anyone. So this was a nice surprise, just the way I like them at that and I didn’t ask for it that way either! He did it all his own accord! &lt;3

"Two baby Pigeon died under my supervision, I feel responsible!","I came back home from another country after 9 months just to find that my house's cleaning(where we do laundry) area had been annexed by 7-8 pigeons and they have not only laid eggs but 4 babies at 2 different places 1 nest was in a small tub and other was on a store box top which is not easy to access.

Then I thought “oh it must be my new detergent,” so I got some of that hypoallergenic stuff without perfume or color, but I was still really rashy for a week. I was getting scared that I might have covid since I went to the store, and rashes are a rare symptom. Then my physician said it might be the antidepressants since it’s a rare side effect, but we didn’t realize because I had been taking it for a few days before the allergic reaction.

So that went better than expected...,"Here's whats up, I painted one of the walls in my room with black board paint, the idea was to riff and record ideas when I'm feeling inspired, and improve my organisation if I'm honest 😅 . I make video content but when I'm recording alone for a for a good while(2+ hours), I often get a little in my head and start having complicated thoughts and feel fatigued 😩. Where I record is adjacent to the wall so I thought "" Write a list of thoughts to prime you"" This way I can look beside me and remind myself to keep that same energy you know. Naturally I got carried away and personalised it in various ways. I've doodled, added favourite lyrics and even had visitors ""tag"" it 😅😂

How is it going?  I feel focused, My organisation has improved and I'm more productive 💪🏾. I feel like I must mention the wall is the one my TV is mounted on so I'm literally looking at these messages/points/doodles/lyrics whenever I'm chilling.😋

The best bit? I can't help but smile at myself, It seems I've written a list of mantras which affirm me even when I'm not creating content.❤  I've always been positive and it hasn't been difficult to maintain but seeing little messages to remind you where I should focus my attention has had a pretty profound affect.😁 One of my favourite messages is ""You're not perfect, you never will be, and that's perfect.""🥰

Well, my parents have a huge home in another city that is their part-time home and they are not using it so, I asked them if we could use it for Labor Day Weekend and they agreed!

I think I've reached a new level of loneliness,"So I'm in college and my roommate and I hung out a fair amount for a few weeks after we arrived on campus, and I thought we became friends with three other girls in the hall.

However. I'm joining a few clubs and one of them is starting its activities next week. I've met the members online and it's seems hype af. Plus I've found really good webtoons and other comics online so I've been mostly reading those. Basically, I've been feeling a lot better.

Now this is where it gets interesting. Last night, I dreamt that my roommate was hanging out with two other people (she hangs out with them irl) and I was kinda upset. They went to get food and my roommate brought some back for me, saying, ""do you think I'd forget you?"" This is all I can remember.

What do American kids study in school instead of foreign languages?,"I'm Finnish (Finland, Northern Europe) and I guess most redditors don't know but we are required by law to study both English and Swedish in school and then you can make a choice (wow) to take a third foreign language out of the few others your school offers (usually German and French). There was a discussion on r/finland about Swedish and I got the idea to calculate how much time I have used (wasted) studying it including a few extra courses I took. For high school, the result was 228 hours and probably about 50 hours more on top of that official number (38 hours/course) because I did extra stuff on my own. Didn't find the hours for grades 7-9 but the search made me think about time spent learning foreign languages in general. I spent 912 hours learning English, Swedish and German in  highschool only + the English classes on grades 3-9 + the Swedish classes on grades 7-9. I don't have the numbers for students who don't take extra courses but the load is hundreds of hours anyway. Question is, what do Americans and others do with all the time they don't have to or get to spend on learning languages?

My last few months have consisted of getting rejected for jobs that I probably won't even like anyway.,"Is anyone else in the same situation? I have applied for a ridiculous number of jobs and so far have only been to one interview. In normal circumstances I wouldn't even consider these jobs, not because they are beneath me, but I'd rather preserve my mental health. As we all know the pandemic had wreaked havoc and I'm no longer getting any support from the government but I'm still expected to pay numerous tax bills with zero income hence why I've considered jobs I wouldn't normally look at.

It has also reinforced my attitudes towards unemployment. I come from an area where a lot of people are unemployed and I've held the belief that nobody truly wants to be unemployed as it sucks. People from my rural hometown don't have much opportunity around them and when you are getting rejected from every shitty job going how can anyone stay motivated? Imagine applying for a bunch of rubbish jobs and getting rejected then society seems to think that you're lazy for not working a job that they wouldn't seem worthwhile anyway.

Anyone else a snob about the fresh produce they eat?,"Maybe it was the way I was raised. We grew up eating fresh and frozen vegetables, very rarely canned. I find myself telling my husband and (whoever will listen) what healthy things I ate that day, and ask them what *they ate*. I probably sound like a bitch.

Fresh produce is always best, if you can afford it and have access to it. Fresh tastes superior to frozen or canned in almost everything. Nothing beats a homegrown tomato or radish, but I am ashamed to admit that I *almost* prefer frozen hashbrowns to fresh.

Frozen vegetables are generally ok, I can handle frozen mixed veggies (carrot, corn, pea and green bean medley) sauteed in lot of butter or ghee and with liberal amounts of salt and pepper. Frozen green beans are better tolerated in a green-bean casserole with extra french-fried onions on top.

Canned vegetables to me have an odd texture, and they also look slimy. I can eat some of them if they are prepared and nearly hidden in a casserole. Canned corn smells and tastes odd. I try not to think about the horror of a canned mushroom I found on a pizza when I was a kid. I'm sorry, some things don't belong in a can!

My parents don't let my dogs stay inside our house,"Ok, so I am a 15 yr old male in India and I have started to hate whatsapp. 

It all started a few years back, I lived at a place in a city of India and lived in apartments with my parents. It was very normal and my dogs WERE inside my house at that time. After some time, my family got our own house and when we started living there my dogs were not allowed to enter the house and they lived in the ""garage"" (it's technically not a garage and my family calls it lobby so I may use lobby instead of garage, it is basically a space where my car is parked but it's outside my house and in extreme summers and winters the conditions of my dogs get really bad) at first I did not notice too much that my dogs are not staying with me but as time went by, me and my family have had LOTTS and LOTTS of fights over this. I love my dogs and ofcourse want them to live with me, inside our house and whenever I say that I Want my Dogs to live with me I just get scolded. When I ask for a reason they say that my father is alergic to dog hair, even though we lived in the appartments and he did not show a SINGLE sign of allergic symptoms, and their other reason is that dog hair will get in my throat and I will be sick it will be bad, blah blah blah, and my mother also sometimes just emotional blackmails me saying ""don't you care about your father, do you want him to go to the hospital?"" And they read this dog hair will go in your throat in some whatsapp message and now the situations have got soo bad that I just wanna earn someway and rent a place and live their alone with my dogs. I need help as how can I get them in my house.

"Finally got my sister to travel after 3 months, 3 different attempts and about 7 ticket bookings","Basically my sister lost her job because she developed mental issues (think paranoid schizo) during the last 8 months.

After spending around £3000, I finally got her to board her flight to Asia and onwards towards the Pacific (where all my family is). It only took diplomatic permission to transit!!

The most difficult thing about the whole ordeal is her questioning every single thing because in her mind, everything was a fake attempt to upset her. The tickets were fake! and the covid tests were fake! And the quarantine was corrupting my brain!

Boyfriend tried to fight a bear to protect me,"I saw a post about someone’s boyfriend being cute and reaching out to them while they were sleeping, and it prompted me to share this as well. 

(apologies for the format as I am on mobile, and this is my first post here)

I have been dating my current boyfriend for about 3 or 4 months, and this week we decided to try something new and go backpacking. I am fairly outdoorsy and have been backpacking several times over the last few years, while my boyfriend went once or twice in high school but has not done much in the way of hiking since. For reference, we are both in our early twenties. But anyway, earlier this week we packed up our things and enough food for three days and drove up to the mountains.

We got there fairly late in the afternoon, and only hiked a few miles before setting up camp. We cooked dinner a little ways down the trail from where we were
sleeping, hung our food up in a tree to make it difficult for any bear or critters to get at it (there are black bears where I live), set up our tent, and got cozy. It was really nice to be with him, and we stayed up talking for a while in the light of my lantern. We went to sleep around 9 or 10, excited for tomorrow and the beginning of our adventure. 

An hour or two after we had fallen asleep, I heard whining/whimpering outside our tent. We both startled awake, heard it again, and realized it must be a black bear cub. Black bears are fairly common in the area, and tend not to be a threat (unless they are continually exposed to people or given food, they are very scared of humans and usually run away when yelled at), but mama bears are a different story. They are very protective of their young, and if they perceive that their babies are in danger, they will do what it takes to protect them. 

So naturally we were terrified. A bear cub outside our tent meant that the mom was nearby, and though we may have been able to scare them away, she also was much more likely to become violent to protect her babies. 

But what stood out to me the most was that when we first heard the bear cub, my new-ish boyfriend, that had very little experience in the way of backpacking and did not know much about bears, /instinctually dove over me/ and started yelling to protect me from the bear. This man woke up from his sleep, scared and in an unfamiliar environment, and his first instinct when threatened was to protect me. I’ve never experienced that before, and I just feel really loved. He told me later he was terrified himself, but he pretended that he wasn’t worried so I would feel safe and be able to sleep.

Has anyone felt this way before?

I finished all of my requirements for the Eagle Scout Rank the day before my 18th birthday,"It's 11 PM and I just finished with my last counselor on my final merit badge.

For those that dont know, in The Boy Scouts of America, the highest rank is the Eagle rank and to achieve it, you must complete requirements and complete every other rank first. Some of these requirements need you to earn merit badges, which have their own requirements. Every last one must be done before you 18th birthday because, unless you have an extension of some sort, you are no longer a scout once 18. And some of these ranks and badges are long and hard.

I had 6 badges left as of 2 weeks ago and started this week with 4 remaining. My birthday is this friday and thanks to some very nice counselors and adults, I just barely made the rank.

The celebrity identity,"Starting my morning off right, packed a bowl and a cup of freshly brewed coffee , lounging on my porch, and lately I've been thinking. 

With this new era of technology,  I feel like anyone and anybody can start making music,  at the palm of their hands for some people. Due to this, I feel like there's going to be a change in music and how it sounds, moving forward. It'll sound more electronic in my opinion, due to beats being made on the computer as opposed to using real instruments nowadays. Not to even think about how ridiculous over priced some instruments can even be, making it hard for some people to even access making some music. 

I dont like the fact that while making music, usually these artists have to put some kind of facade in order to attract the masses. And that's just not keeping it real imo. Why do you have to create this sensational celebrity identity in order to make it to the great spots in the music industry. Because simple. It makes the views. And with many views, comes fame. But is that all that they want, is fame? Is it even about the music anymore ? If it weren't for the views/fans, they wouldn't even be famous in the first place?

Surviving 2020 - what’s your silver lining?,"This last week my grandma, mom, and aunt have been in the hospital with Covid. Today we found out my uncle has cancer. My brother and his wife are the center of the family right now and fielding all the medical communication between the hospitals and the rest of our family (thankful he is an NP and knows how to navigate). 

There isn’t a lot I can do right now. I’m sending grocery care packages to different family members and just listening. There is a sense of helplessness I’ve been feeling all year and this week just about broke me but a numbed stoicism took over.

I asked my brother if there is anything I can do since he and his family are caring most of the emotional weight for everyone right now. 

I am on moral support duty. I’m thinking of getting everyone together for a game of online poker or just a good ol’ hangout on video chat. I’m trying to think of ideas to get everyone through with some sense of normalcy in a year where everything is anything but normal. 

I was just having a conversation with someone that everyone is going through something right now. All our problems are exacerbated by the chaos. The only way we survive is managing how we cope and helping each other where we can. Knowing I can be support for my brother right now means a lot.

"My thinning hair gave me anxiety, so I cut it short and now I feel free.","I used to have a thick black shiny mane that I didn’t need to use any hair products at all. All the guys at school  were using like hair gels, wax, and sprays to style theirs but I was just proud of how naturally healthy my hair was.

Then it started thinning a few years ago and I desperately tried to find a hair style to hide my visible scalp. I began to use hair products to rigidly fix my hair in a certain position to hide it. Kinda like Johnny Bravo’s hairstyle, huge at the top and brushed up.

Recently, I’ve been using a black hair powder to coat my scalp on top so that it won’t be visible. It was a fragile technique because it needs to stay in place or it’ll be obvious.

But then yesterday was exceptionally hot, humid, and windy. By the time I got to work, my perfectly calculated hair was a mess and I looked horrible. I took the day off and stayed home. I was ashamed and frustrated. I decided to give up my hairstyle.

So I asked my wife to help me and she cut my hair short, buzzed the long sides and snipped the top into shape. I let it dry naturally into whatever natural way it wants. I went to work, people complimented my new fresh look, and I felt young for some reason.

It's 4 AM and I'm crying my eyes out like an absolute idiot.,"I feel like an absolute idiot, and utterly embarrassed. I have music on, and it's my heart break playlist. I haven't cried to these songs or been effected by them in months, because I *thought* and was *positive* I was over it. Turns out I was wrong. An hour in, and I can't stop bawling my eyes out, at 4 AM.

The worst part is I'm crying over a former friendship and it's almost been a year. I feel pathetic. They're more than likely moved on, happier without me, and I'm sure don't think of me. Here's me the biggest clown the circus offers, stuck in the past who can't move on.

I wish I could go back in time, I wish I could mend the friendship. But, I can't. We're different people now. The people she has around have a vendetta towards me. She also has her first boyfriend and plenty of new friends and best friends, at this point I've been long forgotten.

“Spider-Man would be more accurate if he shot webs from his ass lol”,"Now that I have your attention, I’d like to discuss the 3 Spider-Man movie universes (referred to by the actors names).

In Sam Rami’s Spider-Man trilogy (Toby McGuire), he has organic webbing that he can shoot from his wrists. So for years I thought that’s how Spider-Man was. But then when I saw Andrew Garfield Spider-Man, I said to my sister “I don’t like that he had to make web shooters. It seems like a downgrade!” And she then told me that it was how the comics went. So I thought that was fair enough and in a way kinda cool. But unlike the comics, Andrew Garfield still at least had organic webs, so I assumed that part was also in the comics. But then I found out literally an hour ago that Tom Holland’s Spider-Man (and in the comics) doesn’t even have organic webs. He has to make them as well as the shooters.

So this brings me to 3 different points.

1. The only reason Toby McGuire Spider-Man does the finger thing is because of the comics, but if you think about it, it really makes no sense for him to do that because he doesn’t have to press the web shooter button. So it was technically just a choice he made. (I mean then again there was that little montage where he tried a bunch of different hand gestures and nothing else worked, so they did kind of address the fact that he did the same hand movement despite not having to press a button. Still tho, for what reason would it only work that way and not flat handed? Maybe tendons?)

2. Unless you’re talking about Toby McGuire Spider-Man, the only reason Spider-Man would swing on webs from his ass is if he stuck a web shooter up it. But lmao could you imagine.

3. The fact that people say “It’d make more sense if he shot webs from his ass” is all Sam Rami’s fault.",JEM--,6,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/CasualConversation/comments/imb593/spiderman_would_be_more_accurate_if_he_shot_webs/,attention like discus 3 spider man movie universe referred actor name sam ramus spider man trilogy toby mcguire ha organic webbing shoot wrist year thought spider man wa saw andrew garfield spider man said sister like make web shooter seems like downgrade told wa comic went thought wa fair enough way kinda cool unlike comic andrew garfield still least organic web assumed part wa also comic found literally hour ago tom holland spider man comic even organic web ha make well shooter brings 3 different point 1 reason toby mcguire spider man doe finger thing comic think really make sense press web shooter button wa technically choice made mean wa little montage tried bunch different hand gesture nothing else worked kind address fact hand movement despite press button still tho reason would work way flat handed maybe tendon 2 unless talking toby mcguire spider man reason spider man would swing web stuck web shooter lmao could imagine 3 fact people say make sense shot web sam ramus fault,spider man would accurate shot web lol,jem
Rate my dream,"I had a lucid dream this morning, woke up and immediately wrote down (first time ever) what I remembered as soon as i could while fighting of my drowsiness. It went on like this below;


4th Sept:
Story of a couple that grew apart and are constantly arguing. One day they stumble upon a pair of mystical rings that allows them to control the movements of the opposite bearer. Ensues a comedy of chaos and shenanigans of hell bent loose on making the other suffer. Both tired of the problems stop wearing the rings and come to a conclusion that they must work out a deal to put the rings to better use. (4.30-6.00AM, Cliffhanger)
Protagonist-Alex Wolff

I was the protagonist but for some short moments i had an outer body experience and was able to look at myself whom i looked like the actor “Alex Wolff” (i don’t even look remotely like him, I’m Asian). The couple was me and my fiancé (I’m having doubts with her and the relationship) so it could be a manifestation of my problems with her and was acting it out in my dreams.

I’m a very technical person (engineering background) but do enjoy literature a lot and would like to pursue writing if possible. Any thoughts and comments are appreciated.

I don't hate my name but I kinda wished I had a different one.,"I always feel like my name is too common like a plain jane. I can't even make up a unique nickname out of it like most people could. 

When I was in school, there would always another student having a similar exact name (tho sometime just slightly different of one letter word) like mine at least in the same year if not the same class. 

I once asked my mum why. I think her answer was, before the year I was born, she'd never heard anyone of that name, until then it's somehow became popular-ish. 

Another reason I feel this way is that, my name can be broken down into a different meaning from English speakers pov i.e. ""fat in"".

"My grandma has dementia and I love her beautiful mind. Always find a rainbow in the negative things you can not change, hold on to it and never let it go.","Not sure if this is the correct place for my content but here I go. I just wanted to share some of my favorite moments I had with my grandma lately! Almost two years ago she had a double stroke which affected her short term memory. It triggered an onset of early dementia. For most people, they see it as the end of the road. It makes them sad to see their loved one lose memory and repeat themselves. For me, it doesn’t change the way I look at her. I admire her so much she’s been my rock growing up and my favorite person to be around. She raised me and my sister (not because my mother was deadbeat she just had a really demanding job that required her to be at work a lot). I keep getting texts from my mom, sister, grandpa etc telling me how she continues to tell the same story over and over again, sometimes 5 times in an hour. Let me tell you something, I love those stories no matter how many times I hear them!!! They bring her so much joy when she tells them. They are good, happy, and beautiful memories she’s decided to store. Every time she tells me she saw 5 deer in her yard the other morning, her face lights up! What a beautiful image to have and share! I’ll engage each time she tells it I’ll ask her details (although I know them, they never change). She tells me stories of her childhood growing up in Arkansas. My favorite is the one were she explores the creek by her house and finds these rocks perfectly shaped as balls. She then proceeds to get up and gift me these rock balls she’s had since she was 7 (she’s 84 now). I get excited each time she gives them to me. Little does she know I put them back where she keeps them so she can retell the story and have the joy of giving me her special rock balls. I would hate for her to not have them one day and get sad because she thinks she’s lost them. She gets so disheartened when she forgets and people have to remind her almost as if it was a nuisance to them. I just wanted to share this for the people who have family members that struggle.

I got a perfect score on my first anatomy and physiology quiz,"I was a little nervous, despite having studied for most of the week for it. 

Took it today and got a perfect 10/10. 

Not a huge deal, but it is the highlight of my week so far. Thought I’d share with someone. 🙂

Edit: I am away from my laptop at the moment, but when I get back to it, I will share some links to some helpful resources I’ve been using. Thank you all for the kind words. 😊

Edit #2: First of all, thanks again for the encouragement and kind words! I wasn't expecting it to blow up like it did, but I hope I can help those that might also be in A+P classes. 

The bulk of what I have studied so far can be found here: https://www.khanacademy.org/science/health-and-medicine/human-anatomy-and-physiology 

The quizzes really helped me, and I use them as a reference point for my flash cards. If KA isn't your thing, check out this link instead: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL8dPuuaLjXtOAKed_MxxWBNaPno5h3Zs8

Personally, I prefer KA because of the quiz function. I find it easier to take the material in little bites - usually reciting the information 3-5 times helps me retain it. 

Someone else mentioned it, but if you are trying to better understand planes (midsagittal, transverse, etc), drawing them yourself is incredibly helpful. It doesn't have to be perfect (mind are not great at all), but they were surprisingly effective.

Finally, if you are in pre-nursing as I am and are considering taking the TEAS test, I strongly recommend a few sources:

ATI TEAS Pocket Prep - Free trial download on Apple's app store 

ATI TEAS Secrets Study Guide - Shop around. You can find digital copies for as low as $6. Make sure you take notes though!

Quizlet has some good flashcards that are already made. These largely cover simple terms. I don't recommend it for helping with diagrams, which there will be a lot of, but it's good to to use for word definitions. There are a lot of different ones available. I would just run a quick Google search.  

If I think of anything else, I will be sure to add it.

So I wait until 1, no one shows up, I send a text asking if they were ready to begin Nat 1:15 and sat there til 1:30, still no one showed up in the chatroom.  

So I close the chat and tell them I have other things to do today but I would appreciate it if they rescheduled for a time that worked better for them, I've gotten no response back.

Blackadder Goes Forth: Finale Thoughts and A Big Slice of Sad,"I was not born anywhere near the airing of Blackadder, but my interest was piqued when I found it recommended after Mr. Bean. A week after first stumbling on it I reach Blackadder Goes Forth, in the trenches of the Great War. The jaded sarcastic Blackadder no longer wants power, money, fame, or social standing. The fourth series is fully focused on his futile plans to escape the inevitable in the trenches.

**SPOILERS AHEAD**

Amusing, funny, the weight of what Blackadder so desperately wants doesn’t sink in until the last episode. No real plot here, the last few tries to escape are foiled (feigning madness and calling Haig for a final reprieve only to be told to feign madness). Even Darling, that cowardly codling hiding behind his notepad and pyjama folding, cannot escape. It first got dark when we see Darling cry to Melchett to not send him to the trenches, that “the car is already here”. Even the naively patriotic George is scared, for he has no intention to die. They talk of a future that seems happy but that doesn’t seem to exist. Blackadder, the most sarcastic and snarky character, says with genuine care, “Good luck everyone.” He assures Baldrick that his cunning plan must be saved for later, wished luck in a most vulnerable tone, and off they pop into the fog.

Mu eyes sweated for a good ten minutes the first time. It gave me a much more profound appreciation of the first World War. History books give a flat and purely academic view, but the ending was just so much deeper and visceral, because you see these characters with a backstory that is important, to them at least, and the distance (35 miles as Melchett said) between the fighters and the commanders. (not ragging the commanders, it was a new age of war with much different strategies, but damn I wanted to punch Melchett so much; let Darling speak you incapable bottom). George would’ve settled into the country, being the only one of his friends to survive, and Darling would’ve married Doris. 

I feel Darling’s entry into his diary sum the predicaments here nicely: Bugger.

Note also that the laughing from the audience got more unsure, and even when Blackadder made one final crack (Who would have noticed another madman around her?) there is no semblance of laughter. If the episode didn’t have the looming death of the beloved characters it would’ve been a giggle at least. They charge, as the trench fades into a poppy field, assumed to be what remains of the battlefield. Silence. No end credits, no march song, no music. Just the deafening silence punctuated by birdsong. When I said 10 minutes of eye sweat I counted from the end, but they’d begun to perspire when Darling mentioned his wish to marry Doris.

Comcast sucks.,"Once, my Dad wanted to get better internet he called Comcast to get rid of some channels. The idiot on the phone kept asking him if he wanted to upgrade his service so he has the channels AND the faster internet. After my Dad kept trying to explain he just wants to get rid of the channels, she kept persisting. For 20 minutes. We finally got the ""better"" internet which turned out to be worse. 

Another time, we were trying to get ethernet hooked up to my PC, since it had a poor connection to the new internet my Dad got to make it better. Little did we know that we had to upgrade the internet to start the ethernet plug. So my Dad calls Comcast and eventually a lady picks up. She apparently was also stupid because it took my Dad 15 minutes to explain the problem, because that stupid dum-dum couldn't understand. Eventually she told us we have to get someone to check it out, which we DIDN'T, my Dad was just trying to upgrade the service.

So a few days later the Comcast guy comes, and guess what he does? Nothing! He moves the router from the garage to the living room, and puts smaller connections that hook up to the router. He did improve the internet for me, but he did nothing to the ethernet plug, which was the original problem.

Batman the Dark Knight isn't as good as people say it is (kind of overrated).,"Now  that i caught your attention with the word overrated let's get in to why i think so.

Don't get me wrong the movie was really good the characters were well written the acting was amazing  and the directing was spectacular but it's not a 10/10 movie in my humble opinion,usually when i watch a 10/10 movie i get this feeling of OMG WHAT DID I JUST WITNESS, before watching the movie i would always hear some people saying it's one of the best movies ever made Heath ledger's performance is one of the best ever, yeas Heath Ledger gave me the feeling that that was the joker on camera not an actor but the movie is called Batman the Dark Knight it's not the story of the joker you can't say the movie was spectacular due to a supporting role I watched the movie with some pre built up hype and if not for the Harvey arc and the un appreciated debate of whether Batman should exist or not i would of gave the movie like a 6/10 (gave it a 9/10).

Same thing happened to me with Breaking Bad and i was so disappointed,

My cat and dog looked out for me today,"I was in a funk today. Well, I have been for a while but today was worse than usual. Just started my period so I was dealing with cramps all day, and I couldn't seem to find the motivation to do anything productive. I was home alone today and ended up moving from room to room, getting up to do something, forgetting what I was meaning to do, and lying down on the couch or bed or whatever to ride out the cramps. My brain just was not functional today. Finally I went and took some tylenol and took a nap, and felt much better after. I even took the dog for a walk and made a list of things I can work on tomorrow so I dont forget. My cat (6 years) and my dog (8 months) are still working on learning to get along, but today I think they knew I wasn't feeling well. They both stayed by my side almost all day, moving from room to room in my aimless wandering. My dog is usually pretty rambunctious but she was calm and napped beside me and behaved all day. My cat seemed to keep an eye on me, whether he was on my lap or  from a chair on the other side of the room. It makes my heart so full to know that even when I don't care about myself, they do. Being the one 100% responsible for their well being gives me a lot anxiety sometimes, (what if I fuck up and they get sick or hurt somehow?)

I can't get over how good Captain America: The Winter Soldier is,"Needless to say, CA:TWS is my favorite movie in the MCU. it's even one of my favorite movies ever. I just rewatched it and I think I'll never get tired of it.

A superhero movie that doesn't feel like a superhero movie. A mix of Marvel superheroes and espionage-conspiracy is the best of both worlds for me. The pacing, writing, and action sequences are amazing. And of course the soundtrack is my favorite in the entire MCU and the best end credits next to Endgame. It feels more mature than the others and breathed a new life into the MCU.

SHIELD turning out to be the bad guys in disguise is a surprising plot twist and a great one. It kinda sucks they once could take down an entire country to being a some resistance guerilla in AOS. Finale spoilers: &gt;!Yes they're back on their feet now which is cool.!&lt;

"I finally did my nails, I'm a guy, and I found a color that will be MY color!","So I talked about this a few times before, struggle for being masculine, not feeling up to being as manly as people would hope I could be. 

For a few weeks now I have tried to get a nail polish I liked at Target and every time they have women in that nail polish department and I don't want to hover because I don't like being seen doing this just yet. 

Someone suggested just saying I was buying it for my girlfriend if anyone were to ask but I was lucky enough to have a clear aisle one day and I nabbed a purple I thought I'd like. So I'm at home putting it on, deflecting questions from male family members who think the color I chose meant something. 

The color was a pinkish purple when really I wanted a darker purple and it looked like a 4th grader did it but it was mine and I felt good for having expressed myself this way. 

Days later my best friend says she'll color my nails when we have a sleepover and she had BOXES full of nail polish! I choose a dark purple and the moment she put it on I knew I wanted THIS to be my color. It's from Essie and it's called Sexy Divide, which, I said could also be the name of a drag queen. 

It's day later and the color is really staying, I'm not doing anything different with my hands, and the color hasn't chipped or smudged at all. I still lift, do yoga, dishes, cook, and the color is still brilliant!

Music and Literature (looking for feedback/resources),"Hello!

I decided to take on a huge project.

Currently focusing on direct quotes/interpretations of authors. It is organized by author-genre-musician-song titles.  
I am getting a bit lost in the project and was hoping for some feedback to keep the momentum of my end goal. I have yet to find a complete or comprehensive list SPECIFICALLY about music and literature.  
SO I decided to make one.

"Okay, I think I've figured it out!","There was a hot debate not long back: does a straw have two holes?

I was pretty adamant in saying it has 1 hole. But the more I think of it, I firmly believe there are two holes in a standard straw.

That is, if the straw itself is longer than the diameter of the hole.

Stay with me here.

A piece of paper with a hole punched in it. That's one hole. Hole is roughly 1/8"" in diameter, however the thickness of the paper is maybe .003""?

Now when that paper is 1"" and we drill a hole through it with a 1/8"" drill bit. That bitch has two holes in it.

Take a straw. Cut it to a length That's smaller than the diameter of the suckhole. It now has one hole, unlike a full frown straw.

I love Boards of Canada.,"They are my favorite musician/band/collective of all time.  If I was being shot into outerspace to spend the rest of my existence nude and in solitude, and could take the discography/tracklist of only one artist, it would be Boards of Canada.  I'm not even that familiar with the ambient/idm or whatever genre they are; I am confident that BoC is capable of transcending anyone's musical taste and able to be enjoyed by a variety of different people with different tastes.   Boards creates a very unique atmosphere, and evokes a range of emotions experienced all throughout life and even beyond, somehow.  There are no vocals, which may be a deal-breaker for some people... but at the same time the perfect tool for those that wish to drift out into the abstract abyss.   

For those who are interested in hearing what all the ruckus is about, I have hand selected some gems... of Canada... nope, that didn't sound as cool as I had hoped.  It's times like these that I regret making that lifelong vow to never again hit the backspace/delete buttonn.. Dammit!

What is your imagination like and how do you think?,"I've been wondering recently how other people think and what their inner monologue is like, given they have them. For any who don't know, an inner monologue is the voice inside your head when you think. Not everyone has one, so I was wondering how people's imaginations work.

So to begin with, if I were to ask you to imagine an apple, what would you see? You don't physically see anything, correct? You just know you're picturing an apple? For me, I can perfectly think of a three dimensional apple with all of its irregularities and blemishes. I can rotate it, turn it upside down, imagine a knife and cut into it, see inside, and turn the apple whatever color I want it to be. All of the color differences still remain the same, and there are still size irregularities as a normal apple would. I believe some people are just unable to imagine an apple in the first place? What are you able to see and describe? 

Now are you able to imagine a place? Like your room or a nearby park? I can imagine any place that I've been to, and essentially navigate my way around the area. Almost like a Google Maps Street View, but in my head. I have gaps in my memory for larger areas, but for the most part I can think of a clear picture. Can you only think of the idea of the place? Or can you see it from a third person perspective?

Lastly, what is your inner monologue like? I am always thinking to myself or have a song playing in my head. I think to myself about all kinds of random things with some little voice that goes on in my head, which I imagine sounds like my own voice. However, if I know a person's or a song's voice well enough, I can remember exactly how it sounds and manipulate their voice to make them say whatever they want. If it's a song, they can say whatever, but it has to go along with the song's pitch, tone, rhythm, and all that. I'm essentially replacing the lyrics. What do you all think of, if you have an inner monologue? For those who don't, are you able to describe what goes on in your mind? I've spent a few minutes thinking about what I'm going to include in this post, basically going over what questions I want to ask and the wording, and I'm interested to see how other people think. 

Let me know what you all are able to do and if there are any other questions you have for other people! Also if there's something special that you have in your mind, I would love to know!",TheRunningScientist,12,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/CasualConversation/comments/im6g8u/what_is_your_imagination_like_and_how_do_you_think/,wondering recently people think inner monologue like given know inner monologue voice inside head think everyone ha one wa wondering people imagination work begin ask imagine apple would see physically see anything correct know picturing apple perfectly think three dimensional apple irregularity blemish rotate turn upside imagine knife cut see inside turn apple whatever color want color difference still remain still size irregularity normal apple would believe people unable imagine apple first place able see describe able imagine place like room nearby park imagine place essentially navigate way around area almost like google map street view head gap memory larger area part think clear picture think idea place see third person perspective lastly inner monologue like always thinking song playing head think kind random thing little voice go head imagine sound like voice however know person song voice well enough remember exactly sound manipulate voice make say whatever want song say whatever ha go along song pitch tone rhythm essentially replacing lyric think inner monologue able describe go mind spent minute thinking going include post basically going question want ask wording interested see people think let know able question people also something special mind would love know,imagination like think,running scientist

"When I created this account two years ago, I’d slipped a disk in my back and was cuddling up with my ex’s dog and codene. I deadlifted 110kg the other day","Funny to think about that. The last two years have been a blur.

My back is a lot better now. I’ve been doing powerlifting for a little while. For a long time I was playing it safe. Always lifting less than I thought I could, to be safe. In my mind, the Injury felt like it had happened maybe 12 months ago..

I walked in one day and thought “fuck it, Let’s see how high I can go comfortably”

I deadlifted 110kg (242lbs) on a [trap bar ](https://www.ironedge.com.au/chrome-trap-bar.html?gclid=EAIaIQobChMItvbqubHO6wIVm30rCh01JwpBEAQYASABEgIGwfD_BwE) (weight 120kg / 264lbs height 183.5cm / 6.02”).

Two days later I took the leap across to a conventional straight bar. Figured if I’m lifting 110kg on a trap, then I could probably try a lower weight on the normal bar. 100kg was ok, a little to much to work with so I dropped it to 90kg (198lbs). That felt good. 

I wouldn’t say my life has been a consistent upward inspiration story since then, but the trend is good at least. 

I have a better job that serves an important purpose in the community. I feel happy knowing that my job is contributing to saving lives (healthcare worker).

I got diagnosed with ADHD and have been seeing improvement from medication. I meditate more. 

I’m happier single (my ex is a wonderful woman, just not the right one for me). 

I even had my first birthday single in a good 5 years...and it was one of my favourites. I worked out, got invited to a bbq and had dinner with a friend. In fact I didn’t even get a present from anyone that day (family lives overseas, my friends are all poor students) and it was still one of the nicest, most relaxed birthdays I’ve had. 

So yeah, happy cake day to me :)",HairyAwareness,0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/CasualConversation/comments/im76px/when_i_created_this_account_two_years_ago_id/,funny think last two year blur back lot better powerlifting little long time wa playing safe always lifting le thought could safe mind injury felt like happened maybe 12 month ago walked one day thought fuck let see high go comfortably deadlifted 110kg 242lbs trap bar http www ironedge com au chrome trap bar html gclid eaiaiqobchmitvbqubho6wivm30rch01jwpbeaqyasabegigwfd_bwe weight 120kg 264lbs height 183 5cm 6 02 two day later took leap across conventional straight bar figured lifting 110kg trap could probably try lower weight normal bar 100kg wa ok little much work dropped 90kg 198lbs felt good say life ha consistent upward inspiration story since trend good least better job serf important purpose community feel happy knowing job contributing saving life healthcare worker got diagnosed adhd seeing improvement medication meditate happier single ex wonderful woman right one even first birthday single good 5 year wa one favourite worked got invited bbq dinner friend fact even get present anyone day family life overseas friend poor student wa still one nicest relaxed birthday yeah happy cake day,created account two year ago slipped disk back wa cuddling ex dog codene deadlifted 110kg day,hairy awareness

"I think I found a twin flame, and I'm so grateful","A while ago I'd read about this phenomenon called twin flames, and for those of you who don't know, it's like this concept similar to a soulmate except this person is like your mirror. They reflect your greatest weaknesses and strengths alike and seem to have some sort of transformative purpose in your life.

When I did come by this, I thought it was pretty interesting but also like one of those super idealistic things that people aspire to have because it's too good to be true. 

About a month ago, however, I did befriend someone who is honestly like the male version of myself. It's like our pain and grief is so alike that there's this effortless bond we share and as someone who doesn't feel like an open book, it's just so easy and it feels so right to talk to him and share my life to him. Our connection is very much platonic and our friendship just feels like magic. In a matter of weeks I think he's known me better than my friends have for years.

Regardless of where life takes us, I know I'll always be here for him and I just wholeheartedly want and wish for his happiness. He's gonna do some incredible things with his life and I can't wait to see his dreams come true. So thankful he exists.

Here's to many years of friendship and some stunning memories yet to be made. ✨",simwalkedaway,19,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/CasualConversation/comments/ilri4r/i_think_i_found_a_twin_flame_and_im_so_grateful/,ago read phenomenon called twin flame know like concept similar soulmate except person like mirror reflect greatest weakness strength alike seem sort transformative purpose life come thought wa pretty interesting also like one super idealistic thing people aspire good true month ago however befriend someone honestly like male version like pain grief alike effortless bond share someone feel like open book easy feel right talk share life connection much platonic friendship feel like magic matter week think known better friend year regardless life take u know always wholeheartedly want wish happiness gonna incredible thing life wait see dream come true thankful exists many year friendship stunning memory yet made,think found twin flame grateful,sim walked away
I stood up to my friends tonight,"Im about to leave for college now, and throughout the last two years my whole friend group decided I was the least favorite.

I tried so hard to get them to love me, I changed my personality based on who I was talking to, I would try so so hard to be like able. I wanted so desperately to be accepted by them. This summer they’ve completely pushed me out, I don’t remember the last time I was invited to anything, but I changed a lot over quarantine and started to not give a shit about stuff that made me feel bad. I completely stopped caring, but every once in a while I would go to group events. This month they’ve completely pushed me out, I see them together every night and no one asks to me to come. I finally said something in our groupchat about it and really stood up for myself when they tried to talk me down.

I really want to apply for a job but I’ve been postponing it for weeks cause I’m scared as fuck.,"I just finished my career. My country is still in quarantine. I’m unemployed. I’m 23. I basically do nothing besides reading books and watching series. I’m desmotivated. I want to feel productive. I need money. 

...and there’s this company hiring, which doesn’t require 251827+ years of experience and allows me to work from home. 

The #1 thing is: it’s completely in English. Completely. 100% excellent English skills, it says. 

The #2 thing is: English is not my native language. It’s actually Spanish! I’ve been learning English for years, since I was a little girl. I’m not bad at it, I’m writing this completely on my own... but what if I fuck up? What if I’m on a Zoom meeting and forget how to say a word? What if I get to work with someone who talks English really fucking fast and I have to “uh, uh, can you repeat please?” Or what if I fuck up on an email or chatting with a customer? 

The #3 thing is: If I’m a shy and introverted bitch even when I speak Spanish, I can’t imagine how I’d be speaking in English + ON A JOB!!!! 

The #4 thing is: Oh, man. Sometimes I wake up and say, fuck it, I’ve been studying English since I was like 3 years old. I’m going to apply, that job is fucking mine. Then I have to complete the first step: recording a video talking about myself and answering some questions. Then a test. Then a job interview......... Oh you know what?! Never mind.

Do you ever feel weirdly nostalgic for crappy times in your life?,"I was cooking dinner tonight and a smell took me back about 6 ago. I was in a run-down home with a crappy boyfriend who treated me fairly poorly. I was absolutely miserable. Tonight I was instantly reminded of that time in my life and I felt weirdly nostalgic. For a few moments, I felt a comfort and wanted to go back to this time in my life. 

This happens often, about 3 or 4 years ago I went through a rough phase, I was depressed, anxious, and I was drowning my sorrows in drugs and alcohol.  I often hear music from that time and it makes me want to go back. Again there is a weird comfort feeling even though I was in a very dark place. 

I am currently in one of the best places in my that I have ever been. I am happy, I have a good job, and I am happily single in my own apartment. Does this happen to anyone else?

Thanks for motivating me strangers.","I was just responding to some messages on a plants community on reddit. Its so lovely to see all these people really love and care for their plants. There is so much to learn for me. 

Similarly there have been so many other communities i constantly learn from just watching no need to post comment anything. Just curious stuff some funny some few not so great. 

I joined reddit to help with not smoking I did not succeed yet, but I do feel a part of many communities, fasting, plants, health, nature etc.

 Absolute strangers without their real name helping each other out. I feel like if there is anything I think I can't ask my friends and family I can ask this bunch of strangers who don't judge me but will answer. I love that.

 Its helped me more since my dad passed away. I never knew how much it hurt till it did. The weirdest post is after that we have to continue life and slowly you get busy with work and that keeps your mind occupied you learn to live on. You see that so many more are doing trying and living the same pain. So at least I can do is say what I know it what I did. Share. 

I especially love the ask reddit ones where as you read the comments it gets funnier and funnier.  This really are a total joy these plp total nuts making me laugh.  If you are the funny kind don't stop we stupid serious guys need you to teach up the way to laugh through these times.

What is one supposed to say when someone is complaining or telling a sad story?,"I often heard that one thing you SHOULDN'T do is talk about a similar experience you've had, like when someone complains about their boss you shouldn't say that you hate your job too.

What is it that stops us from achieving what we know we want ?,I've been wasting bunch of my times lately! It isn't like I'm ignorant about what I'm doing and what might be the consequence of this procrastination. I know how this pandemic is affecting lives and all about disturbing mental health of people and hovering anxiety everyone is trapped under. I'm not panicky. I'm stable. But I can't figure out why.. why in this world am I not able to do what's right for me. My mind knows on what I should focus more on. My mind keeps on repeating this so many times that I believe this thought which at once used to be a short term memory has now consolidated into a long term one and now my mind has stored it for eternity!

The bond between a master and an old dog is such a unique relationship.,"It’s not quite your best friend because friends are autonomous, they don’t wait on you to be able to tend for their needs. Also, an healthy relationship excludes the concept of being someone’s master.

It’s a bit like taking care of your grandma/grandpa but it’s got the energy of a toddler and also the self-awareness of a toddler but the routines of an aged person. 

It’s a powerful bond, a very sincere one, between two living things experiencing life on very different levels. 

I never *had* a dog before I moved in with my girlfriend a few years back. I never cared much for pets but spending my daily life with one, we came to a point where she shows respect for me, listens to my commands, seeks petting and is so f-ing stoked to see me whenever I come in.

How did you overcome nail biting?,"Hey! I have managed to stop nail biting around 3 months ago. I did it using self control and a motivation from sympathy I've met online around that time. My nails are now pretty healthy (almost two decades of nail biting made them shorter, but they are not gross anymore), I still struggle with ""not putting them in my mouth"", but there is no biting - when the urge is overwhelming, I file them short to stop myself. I hate clipping them, makes me really uncomfortable.

Before that I felt really embarassed when meeting new people, especially girls. But stopping was really, really hard. I was doing it involuntarily, even when trying to focus on not doing it. My last best try was 2 months of no biting in a row.

The embarassment got really bothering when I met a girl online and we were sharing photos. Everytime I wanted to show something ""on my hand"" or including my hand was a pain in the ass, trying to hide my gross nails (or what was left of them). Decided enough is enough.

Now I can grab stuff without pain, use nails to open some things (like some ports/flaps in phones etc.) and not be embarassed by gross looking hands.

TIL that I’m a manic pixie dream girl and things are making sense in a whole new way,"Doing some postmortem texting with my ex tonight and he says, “My brain was poisoned by a combination of 80s and 90s pop culture that resulted in the whole ‘manic pixie dream girl’ phenomenon but crossed with the example of my parents as a couple demonstrating the whole ‘couples don’t spend time together’ unless they have to model.”

Fair enough. 

But, as I had never heard of MPDG, I consulted with Professor Google.

The [manic pixie dream girl](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manic_Pixie_Dream_Girl) trope ""exists solely in the fevered imaginations of sensitive writer-directors to teach broodingly soulful young men to embrace life and its infinite mysteries and adventures.”

I just need to talk about how dumb I can be sometimes......,"So, a few days ago, I ordered a drawing tablet, which shipped just today.

Finally lost a little bit of weight,"First time poster here, just wanted to share with someone that I finally lost weight without having to go on a massive diet.

I'm 21, male, 198cm (6ft 6). I've always struggled with being overweight, but ever since I left home to go to uni I've been gaining a fair bit of weight, even with going to the gym 3 times a week. I was starting to get a bit of a big belly, started having to buy bigger clothes, and I hated it. It really was taking a toll on my mental health.

Before I went to uni 3 years ago I was just around 100kg (220lbs). Last time I weighed myself was in March at 127kg (280lbs). I wanted to never go over 130kg (286lbs) so I ended getting scared of weighing myself.

This morning, I felt slimmer than usual, got the balls to weigh myself and I'm at 122kg (270lbs)!!!! I never thought this day would happen. I feel so incredibly happy, and it's motivated me loads to continue (without turning to obsession)

I decided to change my habits start of July by just trying to eat less processed sugar. Examples:
-Not having a soda every evening, maybe just water (and a lot of it).
-If I'm hungry at some point in the afternoon, a banana instead of a packet of biscuits or loads of cake
-And the most important of all was to slow down when I'm eating and being ok with not eating desert or leaving leftovers if I feel full up.

Thanks for listening (or reading lmao), just needed to share this with someone, I hope it doesn't look like a ramble!

Whats the nicest way to get your roommates to stop using your stuff?,"I feel like its easier when its your toothbrush or your game console, but what about a car? Right now the whole house is going through some money struggles and we're all in this together, or at least that's the state of mind im trying to have.
Within the last year I've finally gotten to the point where I can get a wonderful and not super old car! But at the same time, my roomies just got their car repossessed. I told them if they needed it they could absolutely use it especially to and from work.
After damn near all of my tires got messed up and having to borrow money from my Dad just to get going again, i really dont want them to use it at all. Itd be fine if they asked me before hand or if they helped with the car payment, if they were going to interviews or even if they were working towards getting another car but no. 
I have a fear of being used and this is of course not sitting right with me. I'm trying to not let it bother me but everyday its something new(on top of the car situation).

Arguments on reddit or the lack there of.,"I always find it facinating when commenting on controversial posts or just scanning through them that there are threads where people aimlessly jump on bandwagons voicing their opinions but mostly, if not always, lashing out when their arguments are countered or contradicted. 

These types of threads I find amusing at times, but also rather alarming at how people just seem to forget that an opinion is just that, an opinion, and that other people will have a different opinion that contradicts there's, even though they are voicing/adressing the same issues (whatever that may be). The alarming part is what I can only describe as the mindset of these individuals that cannot entertain an idea or opinion, or simply just stop arguing midway through an argument once a valid point is made without a single admittance to the validity of the argument. 

There have been a few occasions where fellow redditors have left me sitting on the edge of my chair within the thread comment's, arguing without being rude, arguing without criticism or harsh outbreaks of "" you #@$%, you know @%#^!!!"" with the obvious downvote spam there after. Arguments where the loser admits defeat gracefully and coming away from it for the better. 

I feel uplifted when I do find these comment's, however the majority of things, aspecially relating to political opinions, gender based issues, civil rights issues, and more recent issues such as the BLM movements and carona related issues that there is a lack of coherent arguments on reddit and it just feels like it's becoming a facebook rant all over again (reddit is far better but the vibe is present).

Password crazy,"I am so exhausted I’m having to keep up with so many accounts and passwords.  Seems like I have more than 50, including work related and personal. Each time u have to do something online, seems to be you gotta download an app, create ID linked to an email and a password.   Now every few months u have to change the password.  If you change phones, computer-laptop or desk top, u must re-download and re use the I’d and password which was automatically saved by your old device which made it easy for you but now u can’t access it.  
This drives me crazy and I am super annoyed about it.  I used to have an app in which I saved all my passwords and log in’s.  I changed cellphones from galaxy to iPhone.  The app was downloaded but there was nothing under my saved information.   This was never an issue for ppl of my generation.  You need to pay a bill, it comes in the mail and u send a check back.  No secret if or passwords.  No change of passwords either.  Now my son told me that the iCloud saves the passwords for you.  How do I get to then iCloud password storage?  He does not know how and neither do I.  Does the iCloud keep this a secret from me?  I’m the one who is supposed to manage this.  

I am in my 50s and wanted to track all of this on paper but the anger it induces paralyzes my actions.  I write them down and get overwhelmed by the sheer number of accounts.  
Then the stupid junk mail that comes in feels like I’m being harassed.  I unsubscribe but they keep coming back months later.  

I want to close the damn accounts but in today’s world it seems impossible to function unless u spend 3hrs of ur day online managing ur personal life.  I could be fucking or enjoying a pedicure  and or enjoying the beauty of this world.

Who else just doesn’t like alcohol and its effects?,"I’m not a fan of the way multiple types of alcohol taste (or any, really), but I also have never enjoyed the way it feels in my body. All of my drinking has been slowly paced in very small amounts, always with a full stomach and extra water, but I always get a pounding headache and end up feeling stupid and slow for the next hour or two.

I’ve felt *slight* euphoria from alcohol before, but only for short moments before a dull headache sets in. Even the expensive stuff doesn’t feel or taste good at all to me. I get why others might like it though, after having tried many different types.

I just turned 21, but even the few times I drank before that, it just didn’t do it for me. I feel like if I ever were to drink anything quickly or allow myself to get drunk, I would *hate* it based on how I feel when it’s appropriately paced. I guess it just isn’t my drug, no big deal.

I reconciled with an old friend yesterday,"So a little backstory is that my friend and I stopped talking to each other for almost a year now. I felt like I said some things that shouldn’t have been said. I finally took the initiative to talk to them about some things I done that was nagging at me this whole time. I’m so proud of myself for even reaching out to her because if I hadn’t, we would still be in that phase of not talking to each other. 

It turns out she wasn’t even mad at me for that. She thought she did something wrong with us and went into depression. She didn’t want to talk to me because she thought I was mad at her, which was completely understandable. At the end of the day we shared deep issues about ourselves that we didn’t know about the other. It made me think about the situation in her shoes instead of looking at her like she was some villain whilst victimizing myself.

We had a long talk and tears were shed, but I felt like a weight was lifted off my shoulders. I really needed to have that talk and we are back to talking terms.

I was like oh I kind of wanted that

He just goes ""oh well its not like we have the space for it anyway"" and just goes ahead and sells it. ""You can buy another one anyway"" thats not the point that was mine :(

Anybody here drop out of college?,"I'm on my 2nd year of Electronic Engineering but my will to learn these subjects has faded. I loath each online class and without peers or professors to interact with I'm struggling.

My Goddaughter made me feel very uncomfortable and then made me burst out laughing. It was good.,"Earlier this week my husband and I found out that a dear friend was in a medically induced coma after her battle COVID went awry. 

It was a very hard day for me. My goddaughter and her family live with us, and being a very empathetic 6 yearold wanted to know why I was crying and what our friend looked like and every other detail. 

I had told her about my friend. Her love of animals, and anime, and general appreciation of being goofy af. I then made the mistake of mentioning to her mother, in front of my goddaughter, that I can't  imagine how hard it is on my husband. 

After my husband came home she asked him why it was going to be harder on him. He said he was very close to her. My goddaughter didn't buy it, but was easy to distract.

Later I told her how our friend lived with me for a time, and a much longer time with my husband, and then i added that my husband used to make kissy faces with our friend!

My goddaughter immediately said my husband's name very sternly. My husband laughed as he tried to explain the whole we haven't been together since birth thing, and she was still upset because he should have know that we were meant to be. 

She still gives him the side eye about it. I think I may let it go on a day or so longer before I explain to her that I also.lived with someone I made kissy faces with.

I feel like I've grown up,"[16M] I feel like my viewpoint towards everything has changed.I can no longer play with the kids of the neighborhood without feeling different. Everytime I have to make a decision or contribute to a conversation,  I surprise myself with the foresight I seem to have developed.
For the past three years, all I've done is prepare for a particular examination that decides the college I can go into. I've worked pretty hard for it, and have always been stressed about how I will perform on the actual D-day. But now, this lockdown thing slipped in, and the whole scenario seems to have taken a 180°. The exam is tomorrow, which also happens to be my cake day, and I'm absolutely carefree.
I'll wake up tomorrow and go give the exam and be over with it, however it goes. It's just a weird feeling, that I'm not worried anymore about a thing that matters so much. I still work for it, but am not afraid of it. This strange , hermit like attitude seems to have sprung up, that I'll be happy with whatever college I get into.

I have one year to get independent and it scares me.,"I've recently turned 17. I still have 2 high school years ahead of me. I live in a ""farm"" in Romania. Due to fights between me and my parents about me not pursuing the farmer life, I have one year left at home. 

I attend to a good school, 60km away from home in a city. At weekdays I stay at a dorm payed by my parents, and the maximum of necessary time I spend in school daily is between 7 am and 3 pm.

I have no money. I have never had a job what payed me. I've planned on working this summer, but pandemic happened and I got rejected. 

I plan to get a night shift job at the city, so I can earn money and attend school, but I absolutely don't know how to do it. I don't know where to look or what to say.  The cherry on top is that I'm a minority and I can't even speak Romanian fluently. 

The other option is to spend this year getting good at coding, and finding a job online. My best language is C++, but I'm really far from a professional level. I don't know if it's manageable to learn it under a year to a level I can work with, and I don't know if even I managed to do that, would I find someone to apply me?

I am really stressed about my future.",macica99,2,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/CasualConversation/comments/ilqg2l/i_have_one_year_to_get_independent_and_it_scares/,recently turned 17 still 2 high school year ahead live farm romania due fight parent pursuing farmer life one year left home attend good school 60km away home city weekday stay dorm payed parent maximum necessary time spend school daily 7 3 pm money never job payed planned working summer pandemic happened got rejected plan get night shift job city earn money attend school absolutely know know look say cherry top minority even speak romanian fluently option spend year getting good coding finding job online best language c really far professional level know manageable learn year level work know even managed would find someone apply really stressed future,one year get independent scare,mac ica 99

My mom asks me for cookies,"Ok so my uncle gives a certain amount of sweets (cookies, chocolate..) per month, and I always take good care of this stuff. By good care I mean I eat it when I really want to, not whenever I’m hungry, to keep a certain “stock”.

Half the time I feel bad for not wanting to share, but the other half I say “well, it’s my stuff and I see how I manage it”, but as the first one always win, I share.

I'm finally quitting my manufacturing job after six years!,"I made up my mind last friday to call it quits, and I actually managed to put in my two weeks notice on Monday. Six years of anxiety, stress, exhaustion, isolation (night shift,) long shifts, and piss-poor management finally pushed me to my tipping point and it's finally going to be over!

What's some good news you got this year?,"Or just something that happened and made you happy.

This year saw many catastrophes but I tend to be the optimistic one and there's lots of good that happened in my life this year.

Firstly, I finished my first year of college, and it feels like I finally discovered a place where I fit in. Stuff I've been bullied for so long, now are considered cool (can you imagine, me cool) and I actually have friends now. Genuine friends!

Not only that but I got good grades and I'm up for a scholarship. With that I could finally get myself a drum kit!

A drum kit as this year I also finished my additional drum classes, and I can say that _I'm licensed in drumming_ :))

On top of that, I was a volunteer at the first reptile expo of my country (that was in Feb) and seeing and interacting with all those cool creatures and fantastic people that loved them wholeheartedly just warmed my heart enough to make a second sun.

My first commissions also took place this year! I'm far from being a pro artist but I felt so proud when the clients loved the work I did for them.

Also, managed to get real fossils for cheap from the paleontological institute, which I tracked the location of with the aid of a new college friend. Picture two young adults in total awe at the geology museum :)

And to top it off, after 4 years of jumping through hoops I managed to finally get myself a bearded dragon, my dream pet. His name is Raysip, he's 2 months old and he just ate from my hand ❤️

As you can see, in my case there have been plenty of good fortunes. Sure, there have been bad incidents too but I chose to anchor myself in the ones that made me happy.

I’m having a really tough time admitting how I feel right now.,"I’m scared and sad to admit how I’m feeling, because I want people to see that I’m mature and confident, even when I’m not.

I’ve felt this way for a long time, and I can’t talk to anyone about it because everyone takes it a certain way and interprets something out of it when I mean only and exactly what I say.

I really have no one to talk to, yes I have acquaintances but I feel like I have no friends, no people who are genuinely there for me emotionally. And it’s not an issue, I’ll wake up tomorrow and do the same thing I’ve always done and I’ll think “man texting them was a bad idea.” “Man making that Reddit post wasn’t a good idea.” But fuck it. I’m alone right now. 

It’s not even that I want to be with someone, I’m so confused about myself, about how to manage emotions. About why I’m doing anything I do. About where to go from here, about how to make sense of it all.

How I gain confidence?,"Hello! I'm 17 years old and I have had low self-esteem for a long time. Until 10 the grade, I wasn't conscious of it, but now I see how detrimental is this lack of confidence for my life. 
Do you some advice for me? I would like to add also I am an introvert person with a few acquaintances ( I couldn't call them friends). I have one girl who I consider a closer person to me, only. 

PS: I live in an isolated village from Europe, with no close relatives and after my dad's death I started to isolate myself from the village. I have  horrible neighbours who have attempted to beat my parent( mom).
Also, I have an overprotective mom, who considers studies more important than social life. What's worse, I listened to her up to high school, where I have the opportunity to see a new medium.


 In order to carry on my studies in high school, I study in another city 50 km from home and I stay at a host, who has a big impact on my realisation that I must change.

Now, do you think I could be more confident if I talked to my mom about my problems. I had a discussion with my host about my problem from the past and she spoke to my mom, but... Afterward, I do not have any discussion with my parent. She just said that there is no point in considering myself a mess and that I am a beautiful person....that's all...
You know,  my mom does not seem the best at teenagers' problems...maybe it is my fault too that I do not try my best to start this topic personally with her...

Do you remember life before the Internet?,"I was born in 1987. Thinking back to the 90's is amazing, because I remember such great times. Very few, if anyone, had Internet.

I remember TGIF on Friday nights, which included the TV shows Full House, Step by Step, and Family Matters. I remember watching Saved by the Bell in the afternoons. There were great Saturday morning cartoons. Pro wrestling was at its peak with WCW and WWF on Monday nights. People read magazines and newspapers. They watched and rented VHS tapes and later DVDs from video stores. People listened to CDs. Sega Genesis, SNES, PlayStation 1, and N64 were in the 90's. People interacted in person a lot more, and spent a lot more time outside.

In many ways, thinking back to the 90's is like paradise. It was certainly a lot more carefree than the 20 later. It was a better time in a lot of ways. I also can't stand most modern TV shows. I'd watch those 90's shows over almost any show today. Practically all modern shows look like complete crap, in my opinion.

Let me share my pain with you,"My gf is trying to buy a ""gaming PC"" for her, so she can do her work and college stuff. She needs a decent computer, good enough to deal with Autocad 3D, and other softwares, and play The Sims. 

The problem is , either she has to spend 4 salaries (minimum wage) for a decent PC, or it won't even run Minecraft 1080p@60fps. Options below that price are really bad, that they are just not worth the price. So either she spends a lot of money, or don't spend at all. 

If this was for anyone else, I would just say to get a trash GPU, focus on CPU and good RAM and later on buy a new GPU, but she needs a good one. But it's exactly the most expensive part.

"Buy yourself a desk, don't just try to manage between the dining room/kitchen table and the sofa or your bed.","I realize that not everyone is fortunate to have the space or funds to do this. I am very lucky to 1 have a job, and 2 no real problems compared to many others. I've been working at home for 6 months. At work i have a standing desk, and a modest window. For 6 months i thought the dining room table (with a box on it to stand the laptop), and the sofa (for a treat!) were fine substitutes, even a fun change perhaps. But since the kids starting zoom school last week I swiftly realized that my being driven to the bedroom (yikes, I did not want to work from f****** bed) or the almost outside shed like space wasn't going well. Procrastination was high, output low, mood terrible and generally i realized I've been more and more disengaged. I worked hard to make my kids nice zoom school work spaces, i looked at their workspaces and thought er i should really do this for myself. Im really tight with money, but I gave up and bought a standing desk. Cleared out the halfway, and i now gave a very simple, minimal set up. Laptop on a stand, wireless keyboard and mouse, and a coaster. I've been so much more engaged, happy, productive, and creative. I feel relieved i have an actual work space. 10/10 feel better.

"I had my first disgruntled customer experience at my job today, and I loved it!","I got a new job recently at a grocery store near my house. After doing absolutely nothing for the majority of quarantine, I’m super happy I finally got a job so I can finally start saving up for university, as well as finally having something to do.

Today was my first day in training and my supervisor had me working the cash register while she watched over me just so I could learn the ropes. Everything was going quite smoothly (besides me turning to my supervisor every minute or so to ask what the fruit that I’m holding is) until this older gentleman walks up to the cash. He mumbled something through his mask that I couldn’t hear, so I assumed it was some sort of friendly greeting. I scanned his items and he pulled out some cash to pay, but as he was handing it to me he pulled back all of a sudden and mumbled something again, to which I asked if he could repeat himself as my hearing isn’t the greatest. He suddenly shouts back to me “3 BAGS!”. I quickly apologize and hand him the bags. As he’s packing his groceries I apologize to him for the inconvenience and explain that I’m new and that it’s my first day on the job. His response? “Yeah you’re the greatest staff member to ever work here huh.”

I am Genderqueer.,"I kinda just want to scream this from the rooftops that I’ve finally come to this realization. I’m not a boy or a girl, I’m something in between, but also it doesn’t matter to me if people think I’m a boy or a girl. Most people see me and assume I’m a girl. Some little kids see me and assume I’m a boy. People have called me sir when they see me at a glance, and then stumble to correct themselves. I always tell them that it’s okay, and they think I’m just being polite, but I’m really not offended. Ma’am, sir, pal; anything works for me. They’re all correct, I am all of the above and non at all. 

I just exist. I just am. Realizing this part of my identity has made me feel so much more free. It’s okay that I am the way that I am. It’s okay for me to express my gender however I please, and people who have a problem with it don’t deserve to be in my life. I hope that everyone who reads this is comfortable in their own skin and feels like they can express themselves the way they want. It’s such a good feeling. When I stood my ground and stopped letting people force me to fit a mold all the time it was like I met myself for the first time. I’m genderqueer, I am good looking, and I have friends that know and except me for it. That’s how it is. It’s right and I’m happy.

What if we got rid of school's grading system and changed it to a money making system?,"Here me out.....


With AI and tech advancing as it is a lot of people will be automated out of a job. I imagine when that becomes a reality some sort universal basic income will be around but what incentive do people have to work or to improve themselves (other than common consumerism stuff)?

So instead of schools having a grading system, why not have when kids start high school they are given a lump sum of money. Not enough to do anything substantial with it but enough that gets them to learn the value of a $.  The further in education a kid goes the more $$ they get. So instead of getting an A in their freshman year they get $250, a B returns $175, etc. Sophomore year the amount returned for getting grades goes up, etc etc. PHD’s will return $thousands$.

Maybe I should have posted this is showerthoughts but I’m curious to hear what other people think about this.

He never announced openly or publicly in any way that he had cancer; he only told his girlfriend and me at first, and he asked that we didn’t say anything because he didn’t want anyone feeling sorry for him. Most of our family, and his friends and co-workers only found out when he’d mention it casually when asked why he decided to go bald lol.

Today I got the car I always dreamed of having.,"I’ve been saving up for a couple months to buy my first car, roughly $750 dollars before I had to stop working to go back to school. I knew it wasn’t enough even though I wanted a cheap car (early 2000’s Honda Civic), although it wasn’t my dream car it would be reliable and last me a long time. But growing up I loved my dad’s Jeep Wrangler, I’m unsure of the exact year but it’s from the 90s. I looked like a monster truck to little me because it was raised up, and I wanted it to be my first car.

Eventually it wasn’t a viable car for my dad to keep around, and sold it. I was sad but I knew it was the best option because it wasn’t getting much use. But today my dad came home from work and started asking about dream cars. Asked what I want my first car to be; Honda Civic. Asked what my dream car is; 1967 Cadillac DeVille. Joked around about the Cadillac for a few minutes before he brought up the Wrangler. I said how I loved that car but he had sold it so I figured it was out of the question.

Turns out the person he sold it to, he was a friend of a friend and never really kept in touch, had gotten in contact with him. He had only drove the Wrangler a handful of times before he let it sit. He wanted to give it back to my dad, for free. It runs fine but needs some repairs, repairs that I have the money for. In a couple days it’ll end up back at my house and I can start fixing back up to how I remember it.

I’m so excited. I’d never thought I’d see this car again let alone it come back to me to be my first car. I’m like a kid on Christmas Eve, I’m too excited to sleep.

I feel amazing for the first time in years!!,"About 2.5 months ago I started a new antidepressant, gradually elevating the dose as it was not doing much for me initially.

"I don’t know who needs to hear this, but if classes are hard for you, keep trying. Fight the good fight, and trust in the learning curve.","Well, I do know who needs to hear it, actually. Me.

My classes for this semester just started, and I may have bitten off more than I can chew. Everything is difficult, and even though I have the pre-requisite courses, I still feel like I don’t understand the material. 

I’ve reached out to my professors for help, spent hours pouring over textbooks, still not understanding. Right now, I’m struggling to understand page 8 of my textbook. 8!

I feel stupid, like I’m a failure, like I’ll never understand and I should just drop my classes and change my major.

But we all face a wall like this eventually— and it’s important to remember that as long as you’re determined to succeed, you will. It might take *more* hours of studying, more help from your professors. It might take help from a different source entirely. But, as long as you keep working at it, you will get better.

Fight the good fight, fellow students. Don’t give up. And if you want to vent, share what class is eating you up. 

For me, it’s Ordinary Differential Equations. My professor is very frustrating— if I have a question on something in the class, he might just refuse to answer it because “I should know this already.” Or he likes to tell me to rewatch the lecture when it’s over, as if listening to the same confusing thing is going to magically make me understand.",Squishiimuffin,6,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/CasualConversation/comments/ilgz7r/i_dont_know_who_needs_to_hear_this_but_if_classes/,well know need hear actually class semester started may bitten chew everything difficult even though pre requisite course still feel like understand material reached professor help spent hour pouring textbook still understanding right struggling understand page 8 textbook 8 feel stupid like failure like never understand drop class change major face wall like eventually important remember long determined succeed might take hour studying help professor might take help different source entirely long keep working get better fight good fight fellow student give want vent share class eating ordinary differential equation professor frustrating question something class might refuse answer know already like tell rewatch lecture listening confusing thing going magically make understand,know need hear class hard keep trying fight good fight trust learning curve,squish ii muffin

"What do you think about tests and theories that ""determine"" your personality?","Recently, I learned about the ""Blood Type Personality Theory."" In short, it is a very popular pseudoscientific theory that basically means that your blood type determines your personality. It may seem strange to you if, like me, had never heard of this before. But it's actually not that strange because the Internet loves ""determining"" your personality. So here is a casual read about some of these personality tests, theories, and beliefs.

First off, just look at BuzzFeed. There are so many quizzes that can tell you what Disney Princess you are, or your favorite food will determine what personality you have. There is no science behind any of this, but that's not really necessary because it's just a fun little quiz to entertain you. You can agree or disagree with the result and share it with your friends. And if you get a result you don't like, it doesn't;t matter because you be whatever princess you want to be.

Now moving on to something a little more serious, Hogwarts Houses. Now, if you've never read the books or watched the movies or do anything Harry Potter related, you might not care about your Hogwarts House. But when it comes to those in the HP fanbase, your House is very important to your identity. And because the Houses are not really created equal, so most would want to be a Gryffindor or Ravenclaw, therefore causing some Houses to be ""better"" than others. People who don't really bother with taking the quiz, will probably ask ""Why do you care anyway?"" But to those who find Harry Potter to be something they hold close to their heart, their House is something important to their identity and personality.

If you have never taken a BuzzFeed quiz or the Sorting Hat quiz, all of this may seem like little things that don't have any impact on people's lives. But now consider the following: Astrology. There is your sign, your element, your horoscope, your love compatibility, and Mercury in retrograde. If I were to compare all of this to board games, BuzzFeed quizzes would be checkers, and Astrology would be fucking 4D chess or something.

And astrology is a worldwide thing. For example, [Astrology.com](https://astrology.com/) alone provides ""daily horoscopes, online tarot readings, psychic readings, Chinese *astrology*, Vedic *Astrology*, Mayan *Astrology*, Numerology, etc."" Cultures all over the world seem to think that your personality is determined by fate or the occult, or some divine celestial objects can predict the future.

Now, this isn't to hate on astrology; rather, I was amazed at how many different forms of it all over the place. Also, you might find yourself to believe in some form of astrology or something similar.  
But another question is, what does BuzzFeed and Hogwarts Houses have anything to do with it. The thing is, while they may seem like they have no connection (my checkers to 4D chess comparison) they are actually quite similar when you consider this: They all ""determine"" your personality.

Of course, they all do so in different ways. You can just take a few minutes to answer questions that tell you what personality you have. It's really straightforward because the questions basically ask you what personality you have. On the other hand, other personalities determining methods are predetermined. You are born on a certain month, or a certain year, you have a certain blood type, etc.

Let's use the blood type personality theory as an example since it started this whole post. I'll compare it to Hogwarts Houses to show how they are similar.

The blood types are A, B, O, and AB, and their traits are as follows: As are well-organized, Bs are selfish, Os are optimistic, and ABs are eccentric. Compare this to the four Hogwarts Houses: Gryffindor, Ravenclaw, Slytherin, and Hufflepuff. Gryffindors are brave, Ravenclaws are smart, Slytherins are cunning, and Hufflepuffs are loyal. In the same way each blood-type has certain traits and quirks, so do Hogwarts Houses. 

But there is something they have in common that isn't so pleasant. While Hogwarts Houses is something J.K. Rowling came up with and wrote down on an aeroplane sick bag, it has become and important part of the fanbase. If you claim to be a HP fan but don't know your house, you're probably not a HP fan. 

On the other hand, Masahiko Nomi published papers in the 1970s that revived this theory originally published by Takeji Furukawa. Today, it is extremely popular in places like  Japan, South Korea, and Taiwan. There are magazines, newspapers and television shows that feature horoscopes and relationship compatibilities. It is such an important aspect of the culture. And regardless of whether you believe in it or not, as long as it is talked about, its popularity and impact will increase. 

But while both Hogwarts Houses and Blood Type Theory have some similarities, the thing that really connects the two is how they both have negative types. Sure, whether a specific trait is a good thing or a bad thing is subjective. But the majority of people don't think that. If you're a Slytherin, you're in the same house as Voldemort so you're basically a evil, murderous villain. 

The exact same thing happens with blood types. While blood type B has positive traits, people focus on how the negative traits outweigh the good ones, so people with blood type B are seen as selfish.

What is worse is that while you can lie about what house you got on the quiz, your blood-type is not something you choose. Not only that, not only can it impact a person's social life, it can affect one's career because job recruitment and school entrance exams have asked for people's blood types in applications.

The main takeaway for me from all this is that people care a lot about personality and identity than they would like to admit. It is all trivial things that don't have a scientific basis or anything to back it up, but they become so popular because it's so easy to categorize people that way. And I guess I wasn't satisfied with it. If we categorize people the same way you categorize Pokemon by type, is any person truly unique and special, and do their traits and personality actually matter anymore?

And if people still think the impact of categorizing people with labels isn't that big, just look at the some of the issues that plague humanity. We label people by race, sex, gender, religion, etc. When you take differences between people and decide you know what, this group is better than that other group, there is going to arguments and disagreements about it. It can be a little argument on the Internet but once it happens in the real world via bullying, discrimination, stereotypes, etc., it becomes an issue. And if media portrays differences between people as one is good and one is bad, we don't really take into account a person's actual personality and instead rely on factors that are pre-determined or don't really affect a person's character.

Of course, it's not really fair to compare BuzzFeed quizzes to racism (I won't go to war with you if you are a different Disney Princess) but the point is that we shouldn't take these quizzes or theories too seriously and harass others for being different. We're all different and that's okay. 

All of these quizzes and theories can't really determine exactly what personality you have or predict your future. But it is fine to celebrate our differences. You can say your zodiac sign, Hogwarts House, blood type, etc. with confidence and be proud of your identity. Just remember that we're all humans with unique personalities so a quiz or belief shouldn't determine who you are, *you* determine who you are. 

But that's just what I think. Whether someone agrees or disagrees, it's a chance for me to learn more about all of this stuff.

Saw a family of turkeys on my drive in the suburbs today and it brought up some emotions,"I’m lucky to see a family of ducks walking around. In my area its actually more common to see a family of deer. And when I say family, I mean there was a momma turkey leading three or four baby turkeys across the street during rush hour. I saw the person in front of me waving them across during a red light and it just filled me with so much joy; I’d only ever seen a wild turkey maybe one other time. 

A few years ago, I was living in Boston and was woken up at 7 am by an unmistakable—surreal—gobble gobbling. The gentle morning sunrise glistened through my dew ridden window, as I peeled the curtain open and laid eyes on the plumpest Thanksgiving posterfowl, galavanting down a main street sidewalk. Oddly enough, there were a few other people already out at the time and they just kept walking, taking no notice. They had to have heard it, as the only sounds that morning were a gobble, a glub, and the light tick tacking of fragile, bony feet, progressing across city cement. The turkey was just another pedestrian, whistling to itself during its morning commute.

Something about turkeys is almost mythical to me. Seeing wild ones makes me imagine a time when the Northern US was a vastly wooded area without shopping centers or office buildings. We eat turkey so often in unnatural processed ways, its easy to forget how long they’ve been in this country—before even the first American settlers. I wanted to get out of my car today and ask the family questions about the first Thanksgiving; what the great Native American tribes were like before colonization. 

I read that wild turkeys are back on the rise in North America, and I’d really like that. Seeing even one in my suburban area is rare; seeing a mother with her turkey babies, proudly exploring the land of their ancestors, evoked emotions that I’m sure mimicked the sensation of stumbling across several unicorns, communing next to a pot of gold.  

Apparently they’re invasive over in California but I mean. They’re cool.

"I finally ""love"" myself","I know, I might be venting a little but I needed some place to talk about this cuz it's really important for me.

For context, I used to be extremely depressed and anxious about myself in any way. I felt bad about anything I did and needed someone's appreciation just to feel the slightest positive emotion. I've wanted to die for the past about 9 years and I am just 17.
I can't really tell you what happened, at the beginning of this year everything seemed to shatter but it all went out as well as it could be. Early this year could easily been the worst time of my life but I guess this built me up. It just randomly clicked, I felt like I was a totally different person. I smiled more, I talked more, I saw things in an optimistic but not naive way. My inner desires what I want to do finally overcame my desire to be with somebody else. I realised that I am rather a sunshine full of positive vibes rather than a person always in a bad mood. 
The time where I was forced to be on my own has shown me how important it is to do the things you love because these things will last you. I am finally putting an effort to improve myself physically and mentally. I am now willing to learn new things. I built my first PCs and now I want to start learning new languages (Italian and French +improving my Spanish) and want to learn how to fix cars. It's such a big relief finally living for myself and not for anybody else.
Was there a simular situation in your life? What made you realise who you really are and or want to be? Who do you want to be? What do you want to achieve next? I am so excited about life right now.",berni_g03,10,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/CasualConversation/comments/ilhzcd/i_finally_love_myself/,know might venting little needed place talk cuz really important context used extremely depressed anxious way felt bad anything needed someone appreciation feel slightest positive emotion wanted die past 9 year 17 really tell happened beginning year everything seemed shatter went well could early year could easily worst time life guess built randomly clicked felt like wa totally different person smiled talked saw thing optimistic naive way inner desire want finally overcame desire somebody else realised rather sunshine full positive vibe rather person always bad mood time wa forced ha shown important thing love thing last finally putting effort improve physically mentally willing learn new thing built first pc want start learning new language italian french improving spanish want learn fix car big relief finally living anybody else wa simular situation life made realise really want want want achieve next excited life right,finally love,berni g 03

I have a GREAT job opportunity but I am not sure if I must take it.,"Background: I work as a programmer in my father's company. It's a really small company.   
I am safe and confortable here and I also know that my only way to grow up, earn more money, is working harder and seeking more customers for us.

I got an indication to work in a multinacional company. It's really a great opportunity for my carrer, but with great powers....  
More money, more benefits(awesome health plan for example), a well defined path to growth inside the company, but much more work aswell. I am kinda lazy and I like to do things in my own time. For example, today I watched anime half of the day cause I have no close deadline coming and I can always do my job at any time, like If I want to work at midnight I can.  
I won't be my ""own boss"" anymore. I will have much more responsability and I'll be in charge of people and also being charged, like all the time.   
That's a HUGE change in my life. I am afraid as hell.  
The job isn't mine yet, but I have a pretty good chance, considering a guy is indicating me. If I start at that job and doesn't go on, the company will blame him, and I don't want that, he is a friend of mine.  
I don't know that to do, omg.

"Played fall guys for a couple days, and I've never felt so neutral about playing anything","Maybe I'm just tired, or I've gotten jaded about it... But I lose a round of fall guys, I feel nothing. I win a round, I feel nothing.

It's not like that with Tetris 99; I get pumped trying to improve, mad at missed block opportunities, psyched at winning or doing a sweet move. Even when there's luck involved in block choice or garbage being sent, it feels like enough skill that strategy and play is overwhelmingly part of adding to the outcome.

I just don't feel that with Fall Guys. It's almost entirely luck, or otherwise other people just suck the fun out of it by pushing (sometimes pulling) you and preventing platforming opportunities. Or worse, some guy starts flying around to the goal line. It's gotten to the point where any victory or defeat feels hollow.

I can't even feel enough to dislike it, because I do see the charm and fun. Nostalgia for Most Extreme Elimination Challenge, and the detail of textures (look at the gym mat plastic corner bunching on the platforms) they're joyful. And the music is banging.

Getting over a lost friendship,"Well, I've been friends with this girl since we were 8, but after High School ended, I moved to another city [not that far tho] and went to a different college, we suddenly started to grow apart.

In senior year of High School, she demonstrated to be unconfortable that I was getting close to my other friend, but I never thought she would ghost me like this. We didn't even fight or anything, and I did try to talk to her about this distance between us, but she said that nothing was going on, that was the last time we actually spoke.

I wish more people had the confidence to say their work is complete and finalized.,"I feel like I have seen an increase in people posting pictures or videos of incredibly well-made artworks or DIY projects or house cleaning before-and-after pictures, always with the caption of something like, ""It's not finished but..."" or ""It's a work in progress"". 

I feel like very few people truly post something that is half-finished, so by giving these posts captions like that, they're simply trying to protect themselves against people who have criticism to give.

""That doesn't look good at all!"" 

""Well, I'm not done with it, so it'll look way better when I'm done"". 

I wish that people could have the confidence to say, ""I made this and I'm proud of it"".

I have been having weird dreams lately. I Wonder if its my subconscious warning me about my mental health.,"I had the weirdest dream ever. I won't go into details but these are things I saw in my dream that were weird-
1)My mom in real life is a very faithful woman but in my dream I saw her flirt with other men and my dad even though noticed It, he didnt say anything.
2) I witnessed my father fall off a cliff by accident. (I felt so helpless at that moment)
3) my sister without a second thought jumped after him. (I was shocked)
4) I hesitated and ended up passed out from seeing this (in my dream) and then in that state. I hear my dads voice asking me let go and jump. So next thing I remember is that I'm falling. (I felt ashamed of myself because my sister didn't hesitate for a second but I did. I didnt want to jump tbh)
5) I'm dead and then I get wings and my father, me and my sister, we are united and I ask dad about my mom and my dad says she lives, we are dead. Its time you let her go. She can live on her own.

"I need to see a dentist, but I'm too afraid to do it. What would you do?","Last year I chipped a tooth, and it has been bothering me. I haven't chewed on that side since.

I know I have to see a dentist, and I want to fix this, but problem is I'm too afraid to do it. And I know the more I wait the worse it is.

I'd look up reviews to choose a place, but that's not a thing here. It's word of mouth that spreads that kind of info around here and I couldn't find any place without horror stories. May no mistake, the pain doesn't scare me, I endure lots of pain regularly by the laws of nature and the chipped tooth also hasn't been nice. It's what could go wrong that scares me

Everyone I know or talked to went in and had to go to a second place to fix what the first screw up.

Mom had her front teeth scraped by her dentist so she would go back and fix that, she went to other place. Dad had to get a tooth out, the dentist broke it and left pieces inside that got infected and kept insisting that nothing was wrong, after days of agonizing pain dad managed to find another dentist that would intervine in other one's work and that found and got the pieces out. My grandma had emergency surgery because her dentist didn't sterilize his tools properly, got a very bad infection and now she can't swim. Classmate had to replace three teeth after her dentist drilled in them accidentally.

I myself as a kid almost got all my lower front teeth removed (the permanent ones). And it's all different people I'm talking. Person A praises dentist X, and then person B says what happened to them there and that they instead recommend dentist Y, but that's where person A got problems fixed by X.

It goes round like circles. I don't know what to do.

I just want to take a second to appreciate how far the Internet has come.,"Don't get me wrong, things aren't perfect and we're still in a bit of an odd period. But there was a time where you couldn't trust anybody at all online and even giving your name was seen as incredibly sketchy. I believe in privacy, but I've also found that more often then not a majority of people are just around sharing their interests in pockets and doing really cool things.

I think it's amazing that on Reddit for example, peer-to-peer hobby marketplaces like r/hardwareswap and r/mechmarket exist where people regularly sell parts to each other safely without any additional escrow. People are just around enjoying their hobbies and honestly helping each other out (partially because it's simpler as well.)

I get why everybody's grandma had the best recipes now,"They had all the time in the world just invent things in the kitchen. I know this probably seems so obvious but it never really hit me until recently. I am 27 and have been jobless for 3 months or so now. I haven't been jobless since I was 18. I have had so many bursts of creativity in the kitchen that I have never had before. I've come up with quite a few recipes that I am super excited &amp; proud of. &amp; I used to hate cooking. I know it sounds old school, but in a lot of ways, it's really gratifying. I get to write these down and pass them on to future generations. It's special.  Yeah, I do plan to go back to work part time soon, my husband and I could really use the extra income. But for now, I am taking full advantage.

IDK... This home office thing won’t happen again in the future for me I guess. And work is really tiring and my payment is not enough to live on my own (i live with my parents and pay my student loan). So I try to be chill while I can.

I felt free for the first time in years,"This all happened about a month ago, but it came back to my mind and I wanted to share it.

At the end of July I finished studying, and had to spend two days in a different city (almost 100 km away) for the exams. 

Even though I'm friendly with all of them, I didn't really bond with any of my classmates, so I ended up spending most of those two days alone, but it was a blessing in disguise.


I woke up early in the morning and drove all the way there, looking at a beautiful morning sky and listening to music.

On the first evening I bought myself some cookies I always wanted to try, then spent a couple hours on the swings in a local park; after it closed I walked to a nearby square and found it full of children playing, so I stayed there a little, offering them cookies and retrieving their ball from time to time.

After this, I was already feeling like I finally had a choice in my life. Quarantine really took a toll on me, even though I'm always at home I hated being denied the ability to go out.


On the second day we all finished with our exams and they told us whether we passed or not; we said goodbye to each other, there were hand shakes, high fives, pats on the shoulder and so on.

Everyone got on their car and drove away; I was the last one to leave. I was thinking of how a big chunk of my life had ended right there; I would no longer be studying, I would never see all those people again, and I would be starting to work in a few weeks.

I started driving back home, when on the GPS I noticed I would be passing through the town where a friend of mine lived. I thought about it for a bit, how we see each other rarely because of the distance, then said screw it, pulled over and called my friend; I asked him if he was free for dinner and he said yes.

We spent the evening together, we got pizza, wandered around the town centre, then went back to his house and sit outside under the porch just talking; when I came back home it was 2:30 am and I had never been so happy before.


It really felt like I had my life in my own hands, I could actually do whatever I wanted, I could finally do whatever came to my mind without having to ask permission or fear being mocked about it.

This is something I have always struggled with, I got my driving licence late, didn't have a car of my own and lived in a small town, so I was always somewhat limited in the places I could visit on a whim; these two days were a taste of what my dream life looked like, and from now on I'll work hard to make it real.",killer_kupcake,2,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/CasualConversation/comments/il3baj/i_felt_free_for_the_first_time_in_years/,happened month ago came back mind wanted share end july finished studying spend two day different city almost 100 km away exam even though friendly really bond classmate ended spending two day alone wa blessing disguise woke early morning drove way looking beautiful morning sky listening music first evening bought cooky always wanted try spent couple hour swing local park closed walked nearby square found full child playing stayed little offering cooky retrieving ball time time wa already feeling like finally choice life quarantine really took toll even though always home hated denied ability go second day finished exam told u whether passed said goodbye hand shake high five pat shoulder everyone got car drove away wa last one leave wa thinking big chunk life ended right would longer studying would never see people would starting work week started driving back home gps noticed would passing town friend mine lived thought bit see rarely distance said screw pulled called friend asked wa free dinner said yes spent evening together got pizza wandered around town centre went back house sit outside porch talking came back home wa 2 30 never happy really felt like life hand could actually whatever wanted could finally whatever came mind without ask permission fear mocked something always struggled got driving licence late car lived small town wa always somewhat limited place could visit whim two day taste dream life looked like work hard make real,felt free first time year,killer k cake
Happy Reminder To Talk To People.,"Since quarantine, I haven’t spoke to many people, neither in real life or through texting and I mostly just talked to my family (and people in Animal Crossing), so 3 days ago I decided to ask my best friend if she wanted to hang out.

She didn’t reply until a day later (not unusual for her so I thought nothing of it), and we agreed to meet up on the 2nd of September, Today, the texts were nothing unusual, just us talking about how we missed each other, we hadn’t met up since December (we planned on meeting in March to give each other our birthday presents, obviously that got cancelled), so I was pretty excited, I got her present wrapped several months too late, and she arrived.

We hung out like normal, laughing, joking, sharing gossip, she was smiling, we played Mario Kart and Party, went shopping, all the usual. Then about 5 minutes before she heads off, she says thanks, she really needed this, because her Grandad died the day I texted her, and she just needed someone to talk to for more than just sympathy, I had no idea, but reminded her that I’ll always be here for her.

Can't find my wallet,"Have you ever ""lost"" a wallet, but you feel like it's not really lost, it's just somewhere where you can't find it. I can trace my steps back. And I think it is probably somewhere in my car or in my house... yet I can't find it. 

I went through a drive through on Monday, then went home, then to a park at night. But when I go to the park I usually do not take my wallet with me (leave it home or in car). But my car was locked so I doubt it was stolen. Next day I was home all day with my kid. And then around 5pm I simply could not find it. 

Maybe it fell out of my car while I was exiting? 

Maybe my kid hit it somewhere (I asked and he denied); he's 6 and he has done this before.

Maybe it's just in some obvious spot and I am completely overlooking it. 

Maybe it fell into the trash or a clothes hamper? 

I checked my bank account and credit card accounts and there's nothing fishy, so probably it's not in the hands of a criminal.

Fingers crossed we get permission to get a kitten!,"Tomorrow is our next rental inspection. They love us, we've been here nearly 3yrs and our land agent only ever has praise for how neat and tidy the place is kept. We've even mulched the garden for the owner at our own suggestion. Tomorrow we're finally going to ask if we can get our daughter her first kitten. The lease says ""no pets"" so we have to ask, but I'm cautiously optimistic that we've proved we can keep a clean house and be respectful of the property. I can't sleep because I'm so anxious to hear what he decides! I haven't had a kitten in about 20 years, and no pets at all for the last 4. My daughter would just flip out at the idea of getting a kitten now. It will be ok if he says no, but I really hope he doesn't.

I can't wait! Just had to share that with someone lol, maybe now I can get to sleep. Wish us luck!!

Does your mindset ever recover from bullying?,"I (29,M) think I took a longer than normal amount of time to learn how to function with other kids effectively. As an elementary student or younger, the way I perceived my relationships with other kids was either that they didn’t want to play with me, or that they just wanted to make fun of me or pick on me. I felt like my entire class of students would bully me, often very much a 20 vs 1 situation it felt like.. (for being fat, bad at sports, ugly.. those were the main themes).. and over time as we went through 5th grade, onto middle and high school, these treatments faded and I developed some good friendships. Life was pretty normal from then on, even having a normal dating life, slimming down, and becoming a college athlete. Since college ended I’ve had a lot of professional success too, having moved from my home town to NYC where I’m living a good life, and I’m aware I have a lot to be grateful for. Still though, I feel like two aspects of who I am as a person remain from being “bullied” as a kid: 

1. I’m very shy around people I don’t know, even avoiding eye contact and I have trouble making conversations.

(And here is the reason for my post)
2. Decades later, I feel a residual amount of pleasure when someone I don’t generally care for is in emotional distress. 

Today I saw a video of a pregnant Australian woman being arrested for trying to organize a demonstration despite currently in-force laws against congregating. You may have seen the video, it’s making the rounds. She is arrested in front of her two kids, is currently pregnant and is going to miss an ultrasound appointment by being arrested, and all of the home electronics were seized by a search warrant. She has a breakdown, and is completely desperate not to be arrested. My reaction was.. satisfaction. I was a little happy to see her so miserable in such a complicated situation. 

So I questioned myself, realizing that I feel this satisfaction somewhat often when I see someone I don’t care for (be they annoying, or maybe I find their views problematic.. whatever the reason) in a distressing situation. I don’t want to be someone who feels joy at another person’s distress. Does anyone think that my innate joy in these moments is related to seeing people feel as badly as I used to feel as a bullied child? That was my only hypothesis to why I have this tendency at all.

If this is related to bully-trauma, have any of you experienced this and fully recovered from your own “bully-trauma”?",jjthejetblame,3,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/CasualConversation/comments/ilc1f1/does_your_mindset_ever_recover_from_bullying/,29 think took longer normal amount time learn function kid effectively elementary student younger way perceived relationship kid wa either want play wanted make fun pick felt like entire class student would bully often much 20 v 1 situation felt like fat bad sport ugly main theme time went 5th grade onto middle high school treatment faded developed good friendship life wa pretty normal even normal dating life slimming becoming college athlete since college ended lot professional success moved home town nyc living good life aware lot grateful still though feel like two aspect person remain bullied kid 1 shy around people know even avoiding eye contact trouble making conversation reason post 2 decade later feel residual amount pleasure someone generally care emotional distress today saw video pregnant australian woman arrested trying organize demonstration despite currently force law congregating may seen video making round arrested front two kid currently pregnant going miss ultrasound appointment arrested home electronics seized search warrant ha breakdown completely desperate arrested reaction wa satisfaction wa little happy see miserable complicated situation questioned realizing feel satisfaction somewhat often see someone care annoying maybe find view problematic whatever reason distressing situation want someone feel joy another person distress doe anyone think innate joy moment related seeing people feel badly used feel bullied child wa hypothesis tendency related bully trauma experienced fully recovered bully trauma,doe mindset ever recover bullying,jj jet blame

Have you ever changed the name you call someone?,"For years I've had a friend. Let's call him Andy Brown.

We've called him Brownie the whole time I've known him, because there are multiple Andys in the group of friends.

How could someone not want to always learn more?,"I absolutely love learning. I love educating myself on new topics or topics that need some brushing up. I often wish college were free solely because I have so many subjects I wish I could properly delve into, but can’t because it would cost me a lifetime or 6 in debt. 

I can’t understand how someone wouldn’t always want to learn more. I see so many people content with being ignorant to life and how things work, and it’s just so odd to me.

And trust me, I’m fully aware ignorance is bliss. Being smart can be rough sometimes, but I’m still grateful for the power of knowledge and all of the good that it can bring. 

I also understand some people do not have the resources or the ability to educate themselves, but again, that does not mean they still don’t have the desire to learn something. That, there, is what I’m getting at. When I learn something new it’s rewarding and is often times useful. I wish everyone understood that. 

Cite those sources, back your science teachers, read up on world history, look into astronomy, architecture, physiology, whatever your mind can think of! There is a vast wonderland of knowledge out there, find credible sources of information and just immerse yourself. It’s a beautiful feeling. 

Pro tip some people might not be aware of:

How often do friends lie about their salaries?,"I’m having a bit of FOMO or grass is greener on the other side mentality

&amp;#x200B;

I am 29 years old and make around $65k as a project manager at a software company. I’m good with my salary and it affords me the lifestyle I want. I’m able and have been able to reach savings goals for milestone items like house, car, vacations, etc. 

&amp;#x200B;

I have friends who are my age who, when we talk about salary, I feel that they are deceitfully one-upping me. Often times I don’t disclose what I make because I hate getting into piss contests over it. Nurses, PCAs, social workers, a lot of jobs that traditionally don’t make more than $65k are telling me they make significantly more than that, when they've only been in the job 3-5 years. Some throw in that they put in overtime or other bonuses. But still, you can research on indeed and Glassdoor and find the average salary and it’s never what they’re saying. So I’m often skeptical. We live in a far out suburb of MN where the cost of living is decently low. 

&amp;#x200B;

Then to top it off my brother and sister who are both sales reps at different software companies tell me that they make $150k a year and they’re both a few years younger than me, decently new in their roles. They make it sound like they struck gold mines and barely have to work. This is where I’m starting to get frustrated. Either everyone is somehow making a shit ton more than they deserve, or everyone is lying to me. 

&amp;#x200B;

I’ve researched Glassdoor and the average sales rep salaries for their companies are about half of what they’re saying with commission. Are they trying to tell me that they’re that much above average? 

&amp;#x200B;

So my ask is; do people lie about their salaries this often? It’s what I’ve been telling myself, but I also don’t want to kid myself. I simply just value truth and above any feelings, I just don't want people close to me lying to me. I want to simply be happy for them while simultaneously letting it motivate me. But I just can’t shake the idea that many are lying. ",DistractedIdealist,8,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/CasualConversation/comments/ilddcn/how_often_do_friends_lie_about_their_salaries/,bit fomo grass greener side mentality amp x200b 29 year old make around 65k project manager software company good salary affords lifestyle want able able reach saving goal milestone item like house car vacation etc amp x200b friend age talk salary feel deceitfully one upping often time disclose make hate getting piss contest nurse pcas social worker lot job traditionally make 65k telling make significantly job 3 5 year throw put overtime bonus still research indeed glassdoor find average salary never saying often skeptical live far suburb mn cost living decently low amp x200b top brother sister sale rep different software company tell make 150k year year younger decently new role make sound like struck gold mine barely work starting get frustrated either everyone somehow making shit ton deserve everyone lying amp x200b researched glassdoor average sale rep salary company half saying commission trying tell much average amp x200b ask people lie salary often telling also want kid simply value truth feeling want people close lying want simply happy simultaneously letting motivate shake idea many lying,often friend lie salary,distracted idealist

My neighbor thought he uncovered a secret feature in our house.,"I've been wanting to write down this memory for a while, and I didn't know where else it would fit.

This happened when I was a teenager in the pre-internet days of the early 1990s. It wasn't as easy to learn how to do simple fixes or house repairs as it is today. There were no YouTube video tutorials. If your furnace was acting up, you payed someone to come look at it, or you first asked a friend or neighbor who might know how to fix it. One day my mom saw our neighbor outside and mentioned some issue we were having with the furnace. He offered to take a look.

My neighbor was an old man with a lot of wild opinions, which were easier to ignore back then. The three of us went into the basement, and hovered around the furnace. My mother flipped the main breaker before he started poking around.

The night before, someone must have paused the CD player instead of turning it off, because when we flipped the breaker back on, we heard a woman's voice loud and clear, announce:

&gt;*Señores y señoras,  
&gt;
&gt;Nosotros tenemos más influencia con sus hijos que tu tiene.  
&gt;
&gt;Pero los queremos…*  

My neighbor stood mystified, looked around in wonder, and gasped, **""Amaaaaazing!""** as if our house was secretly fitted with some kind of futuristic, Spanish-speaking Star Trek computer, and he had somehow activated it through the furnace. My mother had no clue what was happening.

I watched in amusement, wishing my brothers were also there to witness this moment.

&gt;*Creado y regado de Los Angeles*

I accidentally almost injured my dog and even though nothing at all happens I feel bad,"Hi there, 

important things first: nothing at all happened. It's just the thought of ""it could have happened"" that's driving me insane.

So I was mowing the lawn and my dog just likes to hang around and watch me or enjoy the sun while I do so.

I always thoroughly check the lawn for sticks and leftover bones first - dog owners will know ^^

but today I missed a small piece of bone that she must have left, very well hidden on the lawn, yesterday.

as I mowed over it, it shot out from underneath the mower and missed her head by no more than just a couple of inches before it literally bounced of a wall and almost hit her from behind as well.

I immediately checked she didn't get hit by it.
she's fine. it missed her. she was actually quite excited (after the inicial shock), started looking all over for that piece of bone and was proud and happy as, when she found it.

but all that was and is on my mind is: what if it would have hit her? that thing was like a bullet. I would have never been able to forgive myself.

In my mind it actually replays as if it was hitting her. It is as if my brain just won't ever even believe how lucky we just were.

anyway, she might have to stay inside from now on whenever I mow the lawn. It's probably safer in general.

3 out of 4 of the applications opened today. The last opens in October. I just went online and filled out all three applications!

It’s all on a rolling basis so I want to get them in ASAP. I have such a good feeling about this.

I don't know what I've gotten my self into.,"I got autism. On a facebookgroup for autism a guy writes they are producing a tv show about ausitic poeple and love, and need people to do research over. I add some comments about being on the spectrum and how awkward it can be to find love. We're too awkward for neuronormals, and we feel weirded out by our own kind often.. So it can be hard. I get talking to the guy in the comments, and he asks me to join the project. At first I say no. For autistic people being in a partnership or a relationship will often become like a special interest or addiction, a focuse point, they put all their energy into, and I did that, with a man who was abusive. Spend a year isolated and controlled, because I let him rule me, while I just did everything I could to not give him reason to be paranoid over me cheating on him (which I ofcourse never did, for I am loyal to the core) but this loyalty made me go so far with it, it ruined my life. Took a year for me to get out of it. And I ofcourse imagined this show was going to be light hearted and fun, talking about awkward romance, but giving hopes for the future.

I know how easily now I can be controlled, and so I have very high expectations of my next partner, they need to be very special - or else I rather not have anyone at all. And so, I said no to take part in this show. But we kept talking, and he eventually says he'd love it if I did a little video talking about romance, keeping all my horror stories of my past out of it. I knew this would mean I'd join the project, but screw it. I was already into it. So I did the video. He looved it. Send it to his producer. Now later today I'm getting a phonecall from some one from the tv channel to interview me. I am just going to go along with it, makes my day entertaining. Who knows, maybe I'lll end up on tv.

I genuinely hate my body,"I have never been particularly confident with my looks and I know I’m not the most attractive person (Female for context) but I have never felt worse then I did today. For a uni class my professor randomly chose me as for a demonstration and for this I needed to take off my jumper and just have my singlet shirt on (doing an anatomy degree so this is pretty normal). My whole body is covered in really intense and obvious freckles so today when I had to take off my jumper and expose my really spotted arms and have the whole class look at me I just felt so ugly and uncomfortable in my own skin.

Patiently waited for almost a decade to build my dream PC and....Poof!,"I've always wanted to own a PC that can play the latest video games at the highest resolutions. Pretty much the first and only constant thing in my ""To buy list"" as far as I can remember.After years of wanting and weeks of browsing I was finally able to buy and build my dream gig. I invested the absolute most I could so that I won't feel any buyer's remorse after the purchase was made. And this was my investment i.e my money and not something my parents bought for me


So about 2 weeks ago my dream was now reality. It was a Ryzen 5 3600 + RTX 2070 Super along with a 28"" 4k monitor . Not really the highest of the highest end but as I said earlier the deepest my pocket could go

The Poof 

Was casually browsing reddit today and saw the prices of the latest 3000 series cards and felt a freaking dagger pierce through my heart. If I had just waited a couple more weeks I could have bought a 3070 card for the price I bought the 2070 card for. Meaning 2 x the performance boost (very roughly) 



I knew the 3000 series was round the corner but never expected them to be soo cheap.

Im Vaping Way Less,"Hi!! 
This is my first time posting here and im really proud of myself and wanted to share. So I started vaping (i know its a bad habit im not looking for lectures) my senior year of high school and im now a sophomore in college. When I started it wasn’t bad, just something to do with friends. But i got more hooked and would even vape in the bathroom at school. Still, it wasnt too bad. However, freshman yr of college when covid hit and i was quarantining at home it got really bad. I have a Novo 2 and i was filling my pod like everyday. That is a LOT of nicotine. I recently moved back to MT where i go to school, and im already almost out of a bottle of juice. For reference, in the same amount of time my boyfriend isnt even halfway done with his. He’s helped me slow down and only take a few hits every hour or so. Before I was taking a few hits every 10-20 mins. I’ve been on the same pod for like three days now! Its still basically full. Im just really proud of myself bc I am not doing myself any favors by vaping but it had gotten really really bad for a few months and I felt terrible. Sorry for the long read, and I know this isnt a huge accomplishment as I still am vaping but I’m happy with my progress. I’m also open to suggestions so I can get less hooked on this and eventually quit. I don’t want to be doing this forever

Was there anything to see in the morning, before 12 pm? I know there were cartoons on Saturday morning but I’m talking about working days. 
I’m pretty sure during weekdays programs started later, but what I’m really after (besides that confirmation) is what was visible on the tv before any program started? Was it just a black screen, or a picture or something?

I Made It!,"I don't think anyone will actually see this, but today, I just had my first orientation session for welcome week for my first year in university! Two years ago, I kind of lost all hope that I would make it into my dream program / university due to a brain injury from a car accident which caused all sorts of problems for me academically. I had a lot of trouble with memory and word finding and  also developed some speech problems. I suffered from a lot anxiety and panic attacks and depressive episodes. I pushed all of my friends away and preferred to be alone and was just in a really dark place overall. It didn't help that one of my teachers believed I was faking my symptoms and told me to just ""get over it"". The required minimum average to be considered for my program was a 92%. Before the accident, I was at high 80s. After the accident, I dropped to high 60s/low 70s. I just gave up at that point.

But I had three friends who stubbornly refused to leave my side, and they kept encouraging me. They gave me the love and support that I needed and would help me with my studies whenever they could. My mom was also very supportive, signing me up for therapy sessions so I would be able to talk to a therapist about my problems since she knew it was hard for me to open up to anybody. She helped me find resources that would help me do better academically and stubbornly fought school's halfhearted attempts to make things better for me and refused to settle for less than what the neuropsychologist recommended.  

It was hard, but I'm proud to say that I graduated my senior year with a 93.4% average and was granted entry into my dream program and my first choice university!

Failed Driver's Sight Test,"I'm one line short of driving.

Hey, new to this sub and hope this type of post is permitted. I (22/f) live in Nova Scotia, Canada, and due to places being open again went to take my beginners drivers test. I had my beginners five years ago, with my eye doctors permission (I can't look through both eyes to make one image due to facial paralysis and my eyes not moving laterally, so the machine at the dmv was a no-go). My regular eye doctor has a very long waiting list, so I scheduled an appointment for a different doctor, expecting to get ok results. The doctor was SO nice about listening to me talk about my rare facial paralysis (Moebius syndrome), and did all the nessasary tests. Lo and behold, my eyes are 20/50, and NS requires an acuity of 20/40 in each eye, or 20/30 and 20/50 in each eye. He was in contact with my previous doctor's office to see their findings, and they were consistant. He was apologetic and said that because my eyes are shaped like lemons instead of oranges (stigmatisim I think) and that they are around a 6 (abnormally high) that the only thing he could think about doing was hard contacts, but that even then it was a long shot. And they aren't fitting those right now because of Corona. I'm not really sure what I'm hoping to hear right now, and I'm sure he went over every possibity, but I'm desperate.

I'm finally getting braces and I am so excited!,"I am 27. I grew up extremely poor and honestly didn't even know what real dental hygiene was until my adult life. 
My adolescence was rittled with cavities, infected teeth
..etc. 
If there was a problem my parents would pretty much just have my teeth extracted. 
I have been practicing great oral hygiene for most of my adult life and haven't had a cavity in many years! 
Unfortunately though some problems from years prior persisted and at this point in my life I've had 3 wisdom teeth removed (1 impacted), 4 additional molars removed, multiple bone grafts, a few root canals...and then some. 
And on top of all this madness, I have always had crooked teeth! 
Some of the good teeth I have have majorly shifted because of other missing teeth and pressure from wisdom teeth. 
I never put much thought into braces growing up because I knew my family couldn't afford it. 
In my adult life I've felt embarrassed of my crooked and missing teeth and thought I wasn't good enough for braces, that it would be a waste of time, or that maybe they wouldn't even be possible for me! 

BUT!

I finally went to a consultation today and I am so proud of myself! 
They assured me that they can help me get my teeth in working order and make my smile perfect! 
I WILL BE GETTING BRACES! FINALLY! 
I know I have a long road ahead of me still but I'm so happy to be making steps in the right direction! 

In addition, my personal journey has very much inspired me to pursue a career in the dental field. I would love if I could help someone like myself.

My desk on average has about 6 toys sitting on it at a time. My family and friends have gotten used to it but will still ask why I do it, I don't really have an answer, I just really enjoy it. I barely go longer than an hour without having a toy on me, I feel kind of naked honestly without one. They're small, mostly around the 3 inch range, so you can barely notice it, I will have long conversations with someone while fiddling with a toy and they won't notice unless I make it really obvious. I also just like the feel of a good quality toy in my pocket. 

&amp;#x200B;

Its a mix between pokemon, star wars, and superheros most of the time. Specifically the super hero squad, the dc action league brave and bold, Tomy, Jakks, and Wicked Cool Toys Pokemon. There is a mix of others like Robot heroes versions of transformers, but these are the primary. I know from their make and material which ones are best for what pockets I have, what the weather will be/temperature. I thought I would grow out of it in my early twenties, but its just as strong as ever. I never really enjoyed video games, I don't know if its the lack of getting to touch what's happening or if the story feels restricting, I just love making stories for the toys and having that tactile feel. Some people are fine with it, though I've been dumped over it because it was childish. Maybe 1 or 2 people have been actually fine with it, everyone else seems to tolerate it enough. I know its not normal, but I never feel as though I am hurting someone, The collection in it's entirety fits into 2 shelves, I just wish I didn't have to explain I just like toys each time people notice, because I don't want to have to hide it in my own room. In public I'll just put a hand in a pocket and mess around with a toy but in my office I like having them out and on my desk.

Today I began the process of actualizing “Day One instead of One Day”,"Many months ago on reddit, I came across [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/DoesAnybodyElse/comments/fdno1t/dae_think_super_productive_thoughts_at_night_and/fjir0cl/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf) comment on a post that hit me harder than most things I give myself the chance to read. It had stuck with me for many months even though I have severely struggled to implement this wonderful advice, or any advice, into my life. 

But, today was day one. As I was stewing about in my dark hole of depression, I started crawling my way out while I told myself today was going to be day one.

I worked out for the first time in months, I read my book, and I shaved. It might not be much, but after lurking on this subreddit for a while, it’s the small things like this that seem to make the most difference for people as they make small but powerful and positive steps in the direction towards self love and happiness. 

I struggle to turn my mind off when I am not doing such activities, or any activities, so the more active and busy I stay, I believe the happier and healthier I can be. 

Start small or big, the point is just to start.

"To the person who found my mom’s wallet at Costco today, thank you!","(I’m not sure if this flair should be life stories so to be safe I’ll stick with Just Chatting.)

My mom and I were at Costco today. She sometimes needs one of those “drive-able” shopping carts if her feet hurt from being swollen. Anyway, she sent me on my own to look at computer monitors as she scooted off for laundry detergent. Of course the one time I’m not by her side, it dropped out and she only realized once I caught up to her after searching for my stuff.

She was devastated. She tried to hold back tears but she couldn’t. It’s such a tiny pouch too, a little gold pouch I gave her (It’s actually is part of a bigger purse, but both of us hate large purses). It has her life in it. Credit card, cash, license, and some coins. 

So we re-scooted her path, only to find her shopping list on the floor. I honestly thought the purse would have been there too and someone already ran off with it. But instead, someone placed it on a pallet right there. Didn’t take it, surprisingly nobody else took it, no money was missing, and we didn’t know who to thank. But you know who you are. Thank you.

Anyone out there who’s been in a similar situation? Either the finder or the person who lost something?

For some reason some people call me idiot for catching a butterfly inside a very sorry room and releasing it to natur.,"I'm at school, in the schools workshop. It's a dirty place, out of my eye o see a butterfly flying around. In my mind the most natural thing is to catch it and put it outside and that is what I did. For some reason some of the other guys starts saying that im an idiot, stupid and that it's a wast of time. I didn't really say anything to them, but I was thinking to myself are these guys just gonna kill a butterfly when they see them. My conclusion is yes, yes they are.

"Some kind stranger randomly fixed my trunk (while it was in my driveway) sometime between the time I got home from work and the time I left for work the next day, but didn’t leave a note!","So, I got into a hit and run where someone messed up my bumper and it misaligned my trunk too, so my trunk has been having trouble closing. I’ve basically been trying to MacGyver my trunk closed with different types of clips and bungee chords and different types of ropes, but basically I’ve just broken my license plate cover thing trying to secure it to that because there’s a lot of bumps in the road and because I’m not only disabled (and got denied disability because you always get denied the first time) and I’m getting less than 20 hours a week at my job without getting tips since I’m still considered “training”, I just don’t have the money to get it fixed. It’s been months of having this broken trunk and I’m pretty lucky that I haven’t had any cops pull me over and give me a fix it ticket for it coz it’s popped open On the road before multiple times. I’ve just used the “be confident and hopefully the confidence will make the cops go away”. It’s worked so far. Maybe between the pandemic and the protests and all the other shit, my trunk just isn’t a priority, I don’t know.

Anyways, the other day, I walk outside to go to work and my trunk has been magically fixed! Like, it’s closed and it’s not just closed with a rope and a clip. It’s actually completely closed and fixed and I have no idea who did it or how it happened and they didn’t leave a note and like, I’m so incredibly grateful that I wish they had left a note so I could at least thank them and offer to bake them cookies or something! 

I have cameras out front, so I guess that I could try to see if maybe I could identify the person, but I’ll be honest - I’m a bad neighbor. I don’t know any of my neighbors really. I say hello to my neighbors when I see them, but I couldn’t tell you any of their names despite the fact that the woman and her husband that live across the street and one house to the left have lived there for the last 27 years of my life (and tattle tale on both my mom and me when they see us with men). My neighbor next door is a really hard working immigrant and he’s always very sweet when I see him. He always helps the lady on the corner with her trash cans. But, other than that, I don’t know anyone else, so I wouldn’t even know where to start!

So, this goes out to anyone who has done a good deed (and shown integrity when nobody else was looking). You are appreciated and you are important and you have made someone’s life better and easier and helped someone so much more than you could have ever imagined.

Intense lucid dreams,"The other night, I had a really intense and vivid lucid dream experience that I have only had a handful of times. Not only did I realize I was dreaming, but I decided to actively observe and note what it felt like to be dreaming, take in and try to remember the dream scene, and just generally revel in the fact that I am *currently* in a dream. It's hard to explain, but it was more mindful and intentional than regular lucid dreams.


The scene was a misty, wistful sort of grassland, with soft colors, that stretched out for miles, and was dotted by trees that looked like eucalyptus but were as tall as redwoods.

It's amazing how restaurant and supermarket workers react when you're nice and chatty to them nowadays,"Two days ago I ordered from a restaurant I ordered from twice before, they have a nice chicken and beef shawarma dish with rice and sauce on the side.

The dish is two servings, so it was great value. However, the rice was only enough for half the dish so this time I asked in the notes to add some extra rice and that I'll pay in person (site takes credit cards, and extra rice wasn't on the menu)

When the delivery person arrived he asked how I'm doing and told me the owner says the rice is complimentary. He said the owner knows me for the reviews I write on the website. I only wrote two, but it was cool that he actually acknowledged them and mentioned that he appreciates them to me!

The second instance was earlier today. A friend of mine and I grabbed a breakfast plate from a restaurant he knows. We got to chat with the owner and we talked about all kinds of stuff like his other businesses, how covid affected things, etc. We talked for at least 40 minutes. When we went to pay the lady refused to take our credit card, saying the owner says it's on him this time. My friend goes there a lot, and today they wouldn't let him pay a cent. Saying they also made his meal extra special because he called in to check if they're open earlier.

I noticed that covid is making everyone appreciate a conversation. Every time I go to the grocery store now, at least one or two employees and I talk for a few minutes while I do my shopping. Usually I'm not talkative but it's weird how I feel close to everyone now that we're going through similar hardships. It's cool that restaurant owners, retail workers, and everyone else is starting to appreciate the little things.

I finally get to move out.,"I originally had plans to stay in the city I went to college after I graduated. Had a couple of job offers lined up, but as most things in my life happen, they ended up falling through and not working out, forcing me to go back home instead. 

Not too long after graduating, maybe 3 months total, I landed a job 8 miles away from my house. Borderline dream job. Basically work for a mini Google. Insane salary for my position, with all kinds of crazy perks and benefits. I still have to pinch myself sometimes that this is my job, and I've been with them now for a year and a half. 

As most companies have had to do with COVID, we are all working from home right now. Last week, our leadership team came to the conclusion that not only has productivity not declined, but it has actually gotten better for us since we've been working from home. All of our work is done through computers and over the phone, and we really could work wherever we have a stable internet connection. So, knowing that, they made an announcement that we were now allowed to work from home permanently. Not only that, we can even work remote should we decide that we want to move, even if out of state. 

I literally feel like they handed me my official golden ticket. Over 20 years of always catching the short end of the stick. And even when something good happens, it's almost always followed up by crap, and I've never had a string of good happen like this before. 

Being home hasn't been the worst thing in the world. My expenses are minimal, and I've been able to save quite easily, even buying a brand new car and getting it paid off in 10 months. But I was so bummed out about moving out because I knew I'd have to give this job up to do it. Well not anymore, and I couldn't be more excited. I'm not taking off right away, and I want to make sure I've got a great cushion financially before I do, but knowing that it's basically wherever I want to go, and whenever I want to is this crazy feeling of control in my life I've never felt before.

People who wear AFOs... where the heck do you find shoes???,"I (18F) wear an AFO on my right foot due to foot drop caused by my tumor resection surgery in 2017. My Orthotist worked really hard witb me to make my AFO as small and simplistic as possible to give me more shoe options. I really just want to wear cute shoes again, but sneakers are the only shoes that fit. I've scoured shoe stores in person and online, but I cant seem to find something that can accommodate my brace and still look cute. I've seen some websites that have creative solutions to create more space in a shoe, but why can't those ideas be used on shoes that I would actually like to wear?? I'm too young to succumb to granny shoes 😩

What about winter boots? I can't get my foot into a boot, so I've settled for an insulated hiking shoe and gators, but it's not so great at combating -40°C Canadian winters.

Why do older men wink?,"This is probably going to sound weird to ask lol, but  I’ve noticed that my eye doc has been winking at me for the past month or so on the way out of our room when we finish before he goes onto the next patient’s room.

He’s like 60 I’m guessing, I’m 22 and his youngest patient since he works in a place that does not accept insurance except for Medicare, so he def is used to working with mainly older people. I’m only here bc I was referred to him when I moved. 

Out of the 7 months that I’ve been with him, I’ve literally been at his office like every week for the past month and a half for emergency visits and follow ups bc it’s been just non-stop eye issues with a chronic eye disease that I have, so he’s definitely gotten to know me more. He has complimented me multiple times of  how ‘bright of a young lady’ I am, and entered the room a couple of weeks ago with “hows my favorite patient doing today?” Lmao. Am also a new grad nursing student and he loves being able to think critically with me on things that he wouldn’t be able to do with his other patients. 

He’s extremely professional, super chill and sweet, and I don’t think he’s being flirtatious or anything like that at all, but I was wondering why he’s been winking at me on the way out before going to the next patient’s room.

Turns out people in service industry appreciate being treated like a human being.,"Yes the title makes me sound like a obnoxious arsehole.  But just earlier today I was waiting for servicing of my bike. Despite the servicing centres being always crowded I went in a little late and had to wait for some time. There was a guy behind me, an older person who was whining about how long it was taking them to book a request for a simple servicing. He was standing for less than 4 minutes and already had cut the line and was making everyone rather uncomfortable. I was looking outside and was not paying attention, he cut in front of me and was still whining like he was in a line for ages. When finally it was his turn , he was shouting at the guy who was making entries and asking about vehicle problems. Although he was there for 2 minutes it felt like an eternity to everyone. A few minutes, it was my turn. I approached the guy and said hi how are you (just basic conversation),  the attendant looked at me and was smiling, I couldn't see his face because of his mask but his eyes were smiling too. He asked me wheter I was having any problems or just needed a routine check up. He gave me more time than anyone else. He told me it would take another 2 hours or so before my vehicle servicing can be done. I said no problem and thanked him. Afterwards I was waiting outside the service center, there was another hour to go, the attendant comes up-to me and strikes a conversation. So a little patience gave me a discount and I made a friend. :)",fR1chAps,11,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/CasualConversation/comments/ikewcr/turns_out_people_in_service_industry_appreciate/,yes title make sound like obnoxious arsehole earlier today wa waiting servicing bike despite servicing centre always crowded went little late wait time wa guy behind older person wa whining long wa taking book request simple servicing wa standing le 4 minute already cut line wa making everyone rather uncomfortable wa looking outside wa paying attention cut front wa still whining like wa line age finally wa turn wa shouting guy wa making entry asking vehicle problem although wa 2 minute felt like eternity everyone minute wa turn approached guy said hi basic conversation attendant looked wa smiling see face mask eye smiling asked wheter wa problem needed routine check gave time anyone else told would take another 2 hour vehicle servicing done said problem thanked afterwards wa waiting outside service center wa another hour go attendant come strike conversation little patience gave discount made friend,turn people service industry appreciate treated like human,fr 1 chap
I installed a computer part all by myself!,"A couple of years or so ago, my mom gave me her old desktop because she never used it.  It had some pretty decent components, near-gaming quality at the time she installed them.  Alas, like all good things, some of the parts must eventually come to an end.


The graphics card had apparently been giving me some problems.  I updated the drivers a couple of weeks ago, and that's when the trouble really started.  Kept getting BSODs left and right, especially while watching YouTube videos or even just browsing the web.


Bought a new graphics card that came today.  It's a MSI GEFORCE GT 710.  I know it's not the latest and greatest in the world, but I don't play any really heavy-duty, graphics-laden games like some of the MMOs or other games.  I only play pretty casual games; the most graphics-laden might be some of the more realistic walking sims/adventure games like *Quern: Undying Thoughts, Obduction,* or *Dear Esther: Landmark Edition*.  The only fast-paced game I play is *Pinball FX3*.


Wrestled with the old card, popped the new one in, went in ""slicker than owl shit"" (as my mom would put it), and so far it seems to be running fine *knocks on wood*.


The old card was apparently dying for at least a year.  Everytime I'd boot up the box, it'd sound like a [Cessna engine](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VFCRXv6nYNI) with rusty parts.  I'd have to hit it in a ""sweet spot"" (yay percussive maintenance) to get it to quiet down.  Now she's quieter than a church mouse during a funeral.


I just know that I'll have to replace some of the other parts.  I plan to run a scan to make sure there's no malwares or other things that might cause further BSODs.  I'll run the deep scan when I go to bed, sleeping soundly knowing that my scanner will nuke any and all found programs out of existence.",PatrickRsGhost,0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/CasualConversation/comments/ikxbvf/i_installed_a_computer_part_all_by_myself/,couple year ago mom gave old desktop never used pretty decent component near gaming quality time installed ala like good thing part must eventually come end graphic card apparently giving problem updated driver couple week ago trouble really started kept getting bsods left right especially watching youtube video even browsing web bought new graphic card came today msi geforce gt 710 know latest greatest world play really heavy duty graphic laden game like mmos game play pretty casual game graphic laden might realistic walking sims adventure game like quern undying thought obduction dear esther landmark edition fast paced game play pinball fx3 wrestled old card popped new one went slicker owl shit mom would put far seems running fine knock wood old card wa apparently dying least year everytime boot box sound like cessna engine http www youtube com watch v vfcrxv6nyni rusty part hit sweet spot yay percussive maintenance get quiet quieter church mouse funeral know replace part plan run scan make sure malwares thing might cause bsods run deep scan go bed sleeping soundly knowing scanner nuke found program existence,installed computer part,patrick r ghost

I'm getting back into the things I loved as a child,"And it's like a breath of fresh air. After graduating high school I went through some hard stuff mentally. I grew out of my habits and would just sink myself into the same three tv shows while drinking a six pack every night. 

I'm 24 now and I'm working a job I like. I'm in school to become a licensed massage therapist (one of the most adult things I feel I've done in a long time). I live on a farm with all kinds of animals. I've been seeing my friends regularly. I started carving out time to weight lift again, and the soreness feels amazing. I started downloading games on my Xbox and playing again, something I never had the attention span or willpower to do just last year. I bought a book light, and for the first time in six years, I stayed up late into the night reading Harry Potter until I fell asleep. I do yoga every morning and night, and I actually look forward to it. I broke out my old guitar and have been playing my scales. 

I'm the happiest I've been in a long time, and I'm so grateful for it. I don't know what I changed, or how it happened, but I'm glad to finally be feeling better.

2020 marks 10 years since I graduated high school and life is not what I expected AT ALL,"I just realized it’s been a DECADE since I graduated high school and as the title says I never would have imagined my current life for myself.

Obviously we’re not having a reunion given the circumstances surrounding covid-19 and I’m glad we’re not because I don’t think I’d be necessarily proud of who I am in the moment.

Maybe in 2-5 more years I’d be happier to present myself to society again.

I was one of those go-to-college kids. I was dead set on “the path”. I was gonna have the dream 9-5 job. The nice car. The nice house. The perfect family.

Such a sheep. I know. And ever since, those 18 year old expectations have imploded in my face leading me to search out a new path for myself in life. Let’s just say 18 year old me would never believe it.

I moved far away from my home town for several years, started my own business, have the pleasure from working at home, am way more overweight that I want to be, might be getting married soon, and have money in the bank I never thought I would.

Some of it is good. Some of it is not as good as I would hope. But I see now that I want to improve. I want to get better. And I want to become someone my 18 year old self would be extremely proud of.

I’m almost there. Just have to keep working hard.

I guess let this be a bit of insight to some of you younger ones in high school right now. Life is unpredictable. You truly never know where you’ll end up. Enjoy the ride and pursue your dreams.

Also take care of your body. It’s the only you’ll ever have. Sleep well. Consume good things. Move your body. Here’s to 2020 come what may.

I follow Robin Williams' Instagram,"I was deleting a bunch of accounts off my Instagram when I ran across ""therobinwilliams"". It didnt have a blue check or one of those IG circle things, so I automatically thought it was a fan page (ugh, I hate those).

It just made me sad going through the pictures he shared with the world and he still felt like he was alone.

Robin Williams was a hero to me. I still tear up and can't watch Dead Poets Society. He helped me push through a lot of depression as a teenager and I was absolutely devastated when he committed suicide.

Drama shows are fun for a while, and I enjoyed my share of them, but I wanted to laugh and escape a not so fun everyday life.

I love everything about it, the characters (though sometimes you want to shake/slap some of them), what happens in the episodes and how crazy it is, and more than anything the sense of belonging. 
How many times have I thought : this is so Britta, yes Abed would think that, Troy and Abed in the morning (the music stays!)...
It is so positive.
I don't think I laughed so much watching a tv show. 
And now I don't really know what to watch next! 
I wanted to share it with you, maybe get your best moment from the show?

"I suffer from sleep paralysis, but sometimes, I just let it happen."," 

I suffered from sleep paralysis my entire life. I'd wake up and be completely paralyzed, thinking I'm yelling out for my brother or mom when I'm just making very faint whimpering noises. It feels like my mouth is sewn shut and I physically can't form words, while my body is being weighed down by an invisible force. **(I never see any paralysis demon or anything, I've had no auditory or visual hallucinations since I was a very young child)**

Since moving out of my parents' house 3 years ago, I started having it on and off but now that I sleep next to my girlfriend, she can wake me up to calm me down. I've started recognizing the feelings that happen just before and can prevent it altogether, but sometimes I just ride the high.

I recently started taking a new medication which is giving me terrible insomnia, so most nights I sleep 2-3 hours then lay awake all night. So last night, I woke up around 3:45 AM and could not for the life of me go back to sleep. As soon as I finally started drifting, I got the paralysis feeling and was like ""fuck it, why not?"" and just rode the wave. Immediately after it stopped, I let it happen again 5 to 6 more times before I had a sharp pain in my lower abdomen.

I was diagnosed with a hernia that happened to sneak up on me at some point a few weeks ago, and spending a stupid amount of time hyperventilating last night caused the hernia to ache incredibly. Imagine getting flicked by Dwayne The Rock Johnson in just **one nut,** that's what it feels like.

Luckily I didn't wake up my girlfriend but at least until I get this hernia fixed, I'm gonna stop abusing the paralysis.

Does anyone else here suffer from sleep paralysis? If so, how do you manage it or break out of it? I've found just recognizing my surroundings and focusing on what's real (i.e. my breathing) works well for me.",pienerparker,4,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/CasualConversation/comments/ikr5zy/i_suffer_from_sleep_paralysis_but_sometimes_i/,suffered sleep paralysis entire life wake completely paralyzed thinking yelling brother mom making faint whimpering noise feel like mouth sewn shut physically form word body weighed invisible force never see paralysis demon anything auditory visual hallucination since wa young child since moving parent house 3 year ago started sleep next girlfriend wake calm started recognizing feeling happen prevent altogether sometimes ride high recently started taking new medication giving terrible insomnia night sleep 2 3 hour lay awake night last night woke around 3 45 could life go back sleep soon finally started drifting got paralysis feeling wa like fuck rode wave immediately stopped let happen 5 6 time sharp pain lower abdomen wa diagnosed hernia happened sneak point week ago spending stupid amount time hyperventilating last night caused hernia ache incredibly imagine getting flicked dwayne rock johnson one nut feel like luckily wake girlfriend least get hernia fixed gonna stop abusing paralysis doe anyone else suffer sleep paralysis manage break found recognizing surroundings focusing real e breathing work well,suffer sleep paralysis sometimes let happen,pie ner parker

I'm healing!,"Exactly one year ago I had 10kg less, but my stress levels were through the roof, anxiety and struggling with depression.
I was living with other 4 family members, 3 of which were also sick, one trying to revive from several strokes that had fatal consequences, their wife, the most terrible person I've met, my mom, who had a severe undiagnosed kidney problem and my grandmother, recovering from a cancer surgery.
I am the youngest, so I had to deal with all that, not  able to show emotion so things could appear somewhat normal. 

Today I got my blood sample test results and I'm much better, eating healthier than last year, feeling better and happier. Do I like what I see on the mirror?  Not really, but I'm coming to terms with it. However, I want to change that and finally I have the energy and motivation to do so, now that we're all better.

I finally feel like I understand healthy relationships,"I recently became single after a 3 year long semi-unhealthy relationship. I'm in my last year of college, and with covid running rampant on campus, I was really stressed about who I would interact with or who I could see. I got really lucky, because I have a close knit group of 7 friends who have not only stayed safe with me, but have taught me so much within the past 5 weeks. They are so willing to lend me their time and ear whenever I need, without any sense of me owing them anything. I've learned how to draw boundaries with people, how to lean on people without becoming dependent on their support, and how to communicate how I feel without fear of upsetting someone. I am just really excited because I assumed these were all things that were unique to relationships or that didn't occur at all with most people you interact with.

"I'm going back to school tomorrow. I have mixed feelings. Fellow students and parents : and you, how do you feel ?","I'm going to school tomorrow, in 12th grade. It feels a little bit weird. I don't live in the US, masks are mandatory here but not really social distancing. We have already been warned that there will be cases in schools, and that if there's a case in a school everyone will be tested under 48 hours. But I don't believe that. I haven't been in school since March so I think it will be a little bit difficult to keep the rythm of school. My parents are teachers and I have a brother (we all live together), so I've accepted the fact that there's a high probability that I'm gonna catch it. I will try to be as careful as possible, that's all I can do.

On the other hand, I'm exited to see my friends and learn new things

In conclusion, I have kind of mixed feelings. Excited and resigned at the same time.

So, for fellow students who start school this week and for those who are already back in school : in which grade are you ? How do you feel about this return to school ? Do you feel secure ? What are the measures in place at your school ? How is your class ? Do you have friends with you ?

For parents : how do you feel ? Are you sending your child(ren) back to school (and why) ? Do you think the measures taken are enough ? How is it going so far (if your child(ren) is/are already back to school) ?

"This could be my last summer ever, and I’m devastated.","I’m going into my last year at university, and I’ve finally found a close knit friend group that helps me escape the world. 

Before this summer, video games were my escape. I’d play most days after school and sports to relax. I haven’t touched video games in 5 months. 

It’s very cliché but when we’re together the rest of the world stops. This summer has been one for the record books. We went on countless trips together.. camping, movie nights, weekend vacations, everything. It was also an absolute bender! I’ve never had more fun in my life. I’ve never been this happy. 

When we graduate next year, I’m scared that the adventures will stop. No one is planning on moving away, but people will be getting jobs and will start to move on with their lives. 

I’m struggling to deal with it now, even though there is a whole year of school left.

I think it's really funny how The Road to El Dorado (2000) has exactly one musical number.,"Edit: The single musical number is [""It's Tough to be a God.""](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igxDzfJ2MPo) It's around the middle of the movie. At no other point in the movie does an on-screen character sing. 

Like, if you're just going to put one in there, then it's not a musical. There are some other songs in the movie, but none that are actually performed by characters. It's just such a bizarre narritive choice to have the movie be so completely not a musical, but then stick a single musical number into the middle of it. I would love to have been in the final script meeting where that got decided, or in the editing room when some producer said ""Take out all the rest of the songs, except that one. I like that one."" 

And it's not like in some other movies where they insert a single musical number as a storytelling device for how over the top a character is feeling, like in 500 Days of Summer for example. And The Road to El Dorado CERTAINLY isn't a Bollywood movie, where inserting a single musical number in an otherwise un-musical movie is a common occurrence. 

I don't think it's necessarily a bad thing. I like The Road to El Dorado! I just think it's really funny and strange, and I'm sure the decision to do it is some whacky story of bizarre editing and ridiculous studio restrictions that we'll never hear about.",Un_Ecrivain,4,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/CasualConversation/comments/iknpv2/i_think_its_really_funny_how_the_road_to_el/,edit single musical number tough god http www youtube com watch v igxdzfj2mpo around middle movie point movie doe screen character sing like going put one musical song movie none actually performed character bizarre narritive choice movie completely musical stick single musical number middle would love final script meeting got decided editing room producer said take rest song except one like one like movie insert single musical number storytelling device top character feeling like 500 day summer example road el dorado certainly bollywood movie inserting single musical number otherwise un musical movie common occurrence think necessarily bad thing like road el dorado think really funny strange sure decision whacky story bizarre editing ridiculous studio restriction never hear,think really funny road el dorado 2000 ha exactly one musical number,un ec riva

Today I have been told that I wasn't made for university.,"*Sorry in advance for the very long post.*

So today was my last exam (we have a second chance for exams and it starts around the middle of august until the beginning of september) and it was via videocall. This semester has been really hard for me, I failed almost all my exams in june so I had a lot of them to re-do in august. Today I didn't even want to try for my last exam but it was too late to send an email to the teacher so I just continued working and tried my best not to fail but I didn't really believe in it because I'm very concious that it was okay, plus I already knew I failed the whole year ([here is an article that explains the system](https://ec.europa.eu/education/resources-and-tools/european-credit-transfer-and-accumulation-system-ects_en) of ECTS if you care, it's not very important though).

So I ended up failing that exam and at the end the teacher said that I wasn't made for university, and then that I was probably *""the kind of student who believed they just have to read the course once and then it's done because my course is not as important as maths or chemistry""*. I seriously don't know why she said all that but it hurt, she knew I went through rough times but still did that. I know I am capable of doing it, this year has been harder and I know it because my stress never stopped me from studying and this time it even gave me anxiety attacks.

Has anyone experienced anything like this ?

"Last night, I was going through a case of nicotine poisoning.","My friend and I have a tradition we started 3 years ago where each of us had one cigar for the year. Neither of us are frequent smokers, and I personally don't smoke tobacco at all, so when I say I only have one cigar a year, it's literally one cigar a year. It's meant to be a celebratory get together where we go to a cigar lounge and drink scotch and soda. We meet a lot of other interesting people too, but last night was a night I'll never forget.

My biggest problem with smoking cigars is pacing myself. I get the idea that smoking will keep the cigar lit, and it will go out easily. This was my likely mistake, but what follows after I finish happens slowly. First I become nauseous. It's not unusual for me to get uneasy after smoking in a lounge, but this time the sensation only kept getting worse. No sugary soda or amount of fresh air would get me to sober up.

 Next thing I knew, I felt a knot starting to form up in my gut. The best way to describe it was a constant sharp pain that was only made worse from me moving my diaphragm. Luckily, at this point we were on our way back to my friend's apartment (he's driving), but with sudden movement, breaks, accelerating, turns, and bumps, I felt my entire body reeling in pain. Add on top of that being drenched with sweat and being completely numb in my hands and fore arms. I was in rough shape and I'm a lot of pain, but we made it back.

It took every ounce of strength for me just to sit myself up and just turn to be facing outside of the car when he parked. He urged me to stay right where I was, and as soon as he was gone my instinct told me that whatever was in my gut needed to come out.  It was a good thing I had regurgitated one we had parked so the contents of my stomach were on the pavement and not in/on his car. That surprisingly did the trick as I started to quickly recover from my spouts of pain, although still a bit nauseous and a bit dehydrated now.

The rest of the night was uneventful, thankfully. A few Tylenol, some seltzer water, and a few hours of sleep later I was fully recovered. Looking into what had happened exactly, my main hypothesis is that I may have accidentally ingested some of the tobacco leaves from my own cigar. Otherwise, it's possible that it was from smoking the cigar too quickly. Either way, I'll still plan on another cigar next year and take with me what I learned from last night's episode.",polysnip,7,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/CasualConversation/comments/ikjdob/last_night_i_was_going_through_a_case_of_nicotine/,friend tradition started 3 year ago u one cigar year neither u frequent smoker personally smoke tobacco say one cigar year literally one cigar year meant celebratory get together go cigar lounge drink scotch soda meet lot interesting people last night wa night never forget biggest problem smoking cigar pacing get idea smoking keep cigar lit go easily wa likely mistake follows finish happens slowly first become nauseous unusual get uneasy smoking lounge time sensation kept getting worse sugary soda amount fresh air would get sober next thing knew felt knot starting form gut best way describe wa constant sharp pain wa made worse moving diaphragm luckily point way back friend apartment driving sudden movement break accelerating turn bump felt entire body reeling pain add top drenched sweat completely numb hand fore arm wa rough shape lot pain made back took every ounce strength sit turn facing outside car parked urged stay right wa soon wa gone instinct told whatever wa gut needed come wa good thing regurgitated one parked content stomach pavement car surprisingly trick started quickly recover spout pain although still bit nauseous bit dehydrated rest night wa uneventful thankfully tylenol seltzer water hour sleep later wa fully recovered looking happened exactly main hypothesis may accidentally ingested tobacco leaf cigar otherwise possible wa smoking cigar quickly either way still plan another cigar next year take learned last night episode,last night wa going case nicotine poisoning,poly snip

Why do I not gain any form of satisfaction or enjoyment when playing games anymore?,"Currently I'm 25, I've played games for a very long time. Like a lot of people have. To me, it seems like I don't enjoy games anymore, despite the fact I still want to play them. 

I'm not sure if it's because I'm in the *adulting* world, or what it is. I used to play games for hours on end as a kid. It didn't matter the console. From the Nintendo Gameboy to the PS3 back when all of those were big, shoot, I even played N64, the original Nintendo, the SEGA, etc. 

I had so much fun playing games. Nowadays, I don't get the same satisfaction. Is it because most games require an online presence? The cost of the games? I don't even know anymore. 

My favorite series has and always will be the Assassin's Creed series. The whole Ezio trilogy was by far the best out of the whole AC series to date. 

Now I play games and it's like I don't have fun anymore. Even though I want to play them. I'll sit there, try and decide a game I want to play, waste 30 minutes deciding and then only play for 15-30 minutes. 

Anyone else dealing with the same dilemma? I know I have a wife and daughter, so I spend time with my family and I do work as well. I just wish I could enjoy games like I once did.

Do you ever think of people from you past &amp; wonder what they're up to?,"I'm 28. I haven't lived a ton of life, but I've had some really good friends along the way, and unfortunately I've lost touch with a lot of them. 

I'm married with an SO I love very much, and I'm not looking to spark anything from my past, but there are just times where I am overcome with this need to find out what is happening in the lives of the people I've left behind. These can be acquaintances, friends, exes, anybody. I just often think about where people are. 

I think the biggest thing is that I want people to be successful, even if our relationship (however long or short or platonic it was) wasn't successful. I don't know. I spent a lot of time scrolling through Twitter and Instagram this evening trying to find an old high school friend. Him and I were close, at least I thought we were, but I think he removed himself from all social media. The one account I could find is inactive with no posts on it. I'd love to reconnect, even if just for a day to catch up on where life has taken us. 

I don't like getting older. I dont feel older, just the same old stupid 17 y/o stuck in an almost 30 y/o body. Maybe one day I'll reconnect with some of those lost friends, until then I just continue to be nostalgic about the great things they helped me to accomplish and the encouragement they provided as I went through different chapters of my life. They will always hold a special place in my heart, every single person I've ever met. 

That's it. 

Stay in touch with the people who matter the most, even if only for a chapter, cuz in the long run they're going to be the most important people in your memories.

Precious little kitten brightens up our life,"Hello there, I've just wanted to share what has been making me so happy for the last 1 &amp; 1/2 months

To start of i wanna say, first time poster, English is my second language and no covid-19 regulations were violated during this (maybe longer?) adventure.
(Just realized it is a long story..)

To start of the story, my bf and I were abroad like 3 or something months ago with my PIL, and stayed at a friend of theirs. It was more on the rural side of the country, and we strolled along the neighborhood to have a look at the houses and gardens. We found a close neighbor that had like 10 or something cats in her garden, and they didn't look like they were cared for properly (cats have a different value there than they do in our home country). Anyways, we noticed too very white, blue eyed kittens and fell in love with them immediately! We stopped by every day to watch them play through the fence. After four days we talked about adopting them and asked our friend to come over with us and translate, to ask whether she would be willing to give them away. Owner was fine with that, and we decided to come back later because they were still to young to get away from their mother. 

Moving forward three weeks, we come back, for the owner to tell us, that she would only give away one kitten, because her daughter wanted to keep the other one. Fine with us! Next day arrives, and we're going over to pick up ours. When we saw them, it was... well.. a little shock. Like 5 of the cats there had a really bad eye infection, including our little one, and the other kitten hasn't seemed to grow AT ALL in these 3 weeks. They looked malnourished, and actually like they've been abandoned. We picked up Odin (already had decided on that name) and drove to the vet. The vet was rather concerned about him, because everything he blinked, alot of pus (?) came out of his eyes, but she said as soon as we're conducting a vet at home, it should be fine. 

When we got back, we talked to the owner again, to tell her what the vet told us (that they should get checked as soon as possible) but she kinda just shrugged and only told us, to take care of his ears, as there is barley any fur and they could get sunburnt easily. We take that advice, but since we're only keeping him inside, we didn't think too much about it.

So the day of leaving we come back to her one more time, to thank her, and see that one of her grown cats (also purely white) has a SEVERE sunburn on his ears. I'm talking black crumbs, probably falling off soon, and really in no good condition. She doesn't care. We pack our stuff and our little Odin and off we go home. 

During the car ride he was really well behaved, only cried when he wanted water (which he got). 

When we got home he was too tired to inspect everything and just layed down with us on the couch. We got home on Friday evening, so we had to wait till Monday to get him to a vet. That weekend was horrifying! He just laid with us the whole time, didn't eat, barley drank. We were really scared that he wouldn't make it

BUT Odin is a fighter! We took him to the vet (she also was concerned) and she gave us everything we need. 

Its been about 6 weeks now that he is with us, and he is growing so much and is very active! He shows us love, I never thought would be possible to get from a pet! His eyes are still a little infected, and the vet said (after many more appointments) that maybe it will never be gone completely because it was so bad when he was young. We're still treating him, and it got way better, so as soon as he doesn't seem to be sick, we're happy. 

Two weeks after we got him, we also got him a little black kitten friend (Freya) because we're not home all day, and after just two days they began to eat out of the same bowl. So, that worked out waaaay better than expected! 

Sorry that this got so long, but I just looked at pictures from six weeks ago (skinny, malnourished little kitten) and today (well fed, active teenager-cat) and I feel so much happiness for that little guy, and that he feels so comfortable in his new home with us and his sister, my heart could explode! I'm really glad we got to keep him with us and that he fought through everything. There's still a journey ahead of us, but I think he will manage.

Running out of things to do,"M, 22
 I  was getting trained in an IT company, and from march till now I have only worked like 12 days. Yes I get paid. I was a cinephile and loved video games in my college days. Now I am running out of things to do, movies and games seem lame. I don't want to work on my skills too, as it seems futile. I tried writing a novel and it was fun for a week. But that's over too.

Our caterers cancelled an hour before the wedding yesterday and it was fine,"Our caterers bailed at literally the last minute (yes, I am getting a refund). They're a local couple who started a catering business a few years ago and I think, basically, their marriage imploded that morning and he phoned my (now) husband in tears telling him they weren't coming at about quarter to two. The ceremony began at three. 

My first impressions of them were that they were a bit useless but honest and we'd been to an event they catered so I knew they were good cooks and they had good reviews... they *were* completely useless but they were honest about it, so I got that part right anyway. I do feel sorry for them - I really think that their marriage fell apart and he was in tears when he phoned. They've agreed to refund the money but asked for a bit of time as things are tight at the moment and I'll keep an eye on my account but that's a thought process for another day. 

So, we had to arrange food with literally no notice by ringing friends and asking them to run round the supermarket on the way there (remember, the ceremony was in an hour) and just bring what they could carry and they did an outstanding job. They grabbed literally anything they could that was ready to serve.

Telling my mother was honestly the most stressful part because she looked like she was about to explode but I did not have the mental space to deal with that so I just said very loudly that *it's fine now and it's sorted and we're not getting stressed* to which she replied ""no, we're not going to get stressed"". 

She was a caterer for years (but retired from it) and I helped her out a lot, so we basically managed the logistics of it all and formulated the quickest plan in the history of really quick plans... and it was fine. Between her, my friends who ran into the nearest supermarket and picked up as much as they could carry and my other friend who immediately took charge of serving the drinks... it all worked. 

We, miraculously, had bought some paper plates, paper napkins and recyclable plastic forks for the cake and the venue manager (who was doing it on her own!) was literally going through the cupboards for anything she could lend us. She was amazed at how we weren't having a nervous breakdown about it.

At least it was only 30 people, I guess. Plague restrictions meant the numbers had to be low, which was actually okay because we were no longer obliged to invite certain people so it was very much a Greatest Hits of our friends and family. 

We have already had to reorganise the wedding to varying extents *four times*, so getting here has been a bit of a journey, but I am now married and everyone had a good time and it was all okay in the end. 

A slow stream of photos is arriving via whatsapp, email and bookface messenger. Need to go to the bottle bank tomorrow. 

So, if you're planning a wedding and stressing out over chair covers and seating plans and what to feed your guests - don't worry about it. It'll be fine. At least your caterers will turn up. 

And if they don't... at least you'll get a story out of it.

Edit: My brother found this post so I want to also add that he did a really nice job with the flowers and I'm really grateful for his help.

My (very) pregnant neighbour asked if she could have some of whatever I am cooking.,"My super pregnant neighbour knocked on my door and said (paraphrasing) ""can I have a bowl of whatever you're cooking, it smells nice and my pregnancy cravings are going crazy""

Damned right am I feeding this lady. She may have come over feeling awkward for asking, but if she thinks she'd  be leaving without a full plate and a tupperware container of my beef shin ragu she's got no idea how wrong she is.

I felt so proud and accomplished making something that someone had smelled and though ""Well I need me some of that"".

I told her that if there is anything that ever smells nice coming from my apartment, there is a plate for her no questions asked.

Cooking/baking has been my lockdown project, and that poor woman has no idea how much food is coming her way.

EDIT: Wow holy shit, I expected 3 messages asking what I was cooking not 500. Thanks for the awards and all.

A weird amount of messages asking why I'm lying for karma. My account is 3 years old and this is my first post, if If I liked lying for karma I'm pretty bad at it. Slow cook a ragu and trust me your place will smell like it for days, I don't know if its balls or desperation but think if I were pregnant and not just fat I'd feel pretty okay asking neighbours I've met before for whatever specific thing they were cooking.

For the redditors saying I should continue offering food once the baby is here, that sounds like a great idea, I think I'll slip a note on her door saying I'll make some extra portions for whenever she wants them.

Also, **RECIPE**:

Take your beef shin, (crust it) roll it around in course sea salt, cracked black pepper, and dried rosemary, let it sit in the crust for overnight in the fridge. Then take it out and sear it in butter until its browned on the outside and let rest for 30 mins, smother it in olive oil, and lightly cover in foil so steam can escape and roast at 180c for 2.5 hours.

Once it is done let it rest for 1 hour and get started on the sauce: Roast 3-4 vines of picollo tomatoes in salt and olive oil for 40mins. whilst that is cooking finely dice 1 large onion, 1 large carrot, and 2-3 sticks of celery.

Saute the carrot first, cover the pan so you sweat it then add the onion until it all looks soft, then add the celery and 5 crushed cloves of garlic and fry for about another 4 minutes until it all looks soft, then when the pan is still very hot throw in a glass of red wine to deglaze the pan. wait 1.5 mins for the alcohol to evaporate and add 500ml of rich beef stock mixed in with fresh rosemary.

Let it all bubble for a bit on mid heat then throw in your roasted tomatoes and break them up a bit with a wooden spoon, add FRESH basil and some dried oregano, if you can some fresh parsley too, a couple bayleaves and good splash or two of Worcestershire sauce. 

Move onto your beef and use two forks to shred the meat, dont cut it, shred it. then add it to your bubbling sauce.

I like to leave it on a very low simmer for about 2-3 hours until most of the water has been reduced off and you're left with a very thick and rich ragu that is worth the effort put into it.

For the pasta I suggest a fresh tagliatelle or pappardelle because the sauce is very rich and doesn't need pastas that will cling onto the sauce.

This recipe is for about 4-5 servings because its so easy to freeze and fuck going through this much effort every time you want a ragu for one.",OrcaOne,528,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/CasualConversation/comments/ij1pzu/my_very_pregnant_neighbour_asked_if_she_could/,super pregnant neighbour knocked door said paraphrasing bowl whatever cooking smell nice pregnancy craving going crazy damned right feeding lady may come feeling awkward asking think leaving without full plate tupperware container beef shin ragu got idea wrong felt proud accomplished making something someone smelled though well need told anything ever smell nice coming apartment plate question asked cooking baking ha lockdown project poor woman ha idea much food coming way edit wow holy shit expected 3 message asking wa cooking 500 thanks award weird amount message asking lying karma account 3 year old first post liked lying karma pretty bad slow cook ragu trust place smell like day know ball desperation think pregnant fat feel pretty okay asking neighbour met whatever specific thing cooking redditors saying continue offering food baby sound like great idea think slip note door saying make extra portion whenever want also recipe take beef shin crust roll around course sea salt cracked black pepper dried rosemary let sit crust overnight fridge take sear butter browned outside let rest 30 min smother olive oil lightly cover foil steam escape roast 180c 2 5 hour done let rest 1 hour get started sauce roast 3 4 vine picollo tomato salt olive oil 40mins whilst cooking finely dice 1 large onion 1 large carrot 2 3 stick celery saute carrot first cover pan sweat add onion look soft add celery 5 crushed clove garlic fry another 4 minute look soft pan still hot throw glass red wine deglaze pan wait 1 5 min alcohol evaporate add 500ml rich beef stock mixed fresh rosemary let bubble bit mid heat throw roasted tomato break bit wooden spoon add fresh basil dried oregano fresh parsley couple bayleaves good splash two worcestershire sauce move onto beef use two fork shred meat dont cut shred add bubbling sauce like leave low simmer 2 3 hour water ha reduced left thick rich ragu worth effort put pasta suggest fresh tagliatelle pappardelle sauce rich need pasta cling onto sauce recipe 4 5 serving easy freeze fuck going much effort every time want ragu one,pregnant neighbour asked could whatever cooking,orca one

Why do people who are older than me say that I can’t be tired just because of my age?,"I don’t understand this at all, and maybe someone who can recall a similar situation when they were a teen who is now an adult can help me understand this.

Anyway, a random person that I paired up with asked me if I was tired and I said yes. They just laughed and said there was no way I could be tired at my age (16) since I “wasn’t even in my 20s yet.” Is this true? Does being tired become much much worse? 

Do I truly not have a perspective on what it means to be tired? Because I’ve fallen into depressions before and felt like I could fulfill an eternal slumber if my environment allowed me (parents and responsibilities). Why do adults feel the need to invalidate what I find to be true about *myself?*

I struggled a lot with feeling I was unlovable or broken or a bad partner. I’ve spent a ton of time working with my therapist to grow and deal with these feelings. Today, I’m a generally pretty happy and confident person.

But I still struggle a bit with physical contact. I can have a great date, but as soon it is nearing the end I stutter and stumble over my words. 

I’ve been talking to this one girl for three months. It’s been moving really slowly because of COVID. We are both careful. Today was our third date. It went really well.

About 5 minutes after I got there 2 girls, probably my age, walked in and it looked like they were waiting too. I saw one of them wearing a Fear of the Dark Iron Maiden shirt and I was pretty surprised because they didn’t look like the type of people who would like that stuff. Most people who do are much older than me. Naturally I said I like your shirt because cmon, who doesn’t like Iron Maiden. She said thank you and said she’s had plenty more. I asked her if she knew about the new album that could be coming in 2020 and she knew all about it. Our food came at about the same time and we were leaving so I held the door open for them like a gentleman and she said thank you and said “now that I’m closer i can see you have pretty eyes”. I was pretty dumbstruck because no one has really ever said anything like that to me out of nowhere. I kind of just smiled and chuckled a little bit.

I’m so tired of having to buy clothes from expensive specialty stores just to find something unique. 

Men deserve more variation.

My teenager made me so proud tonight with a simple gesture,"I have 4 boys ranging from ages 3 to 14. Tonight the 3 year old was very tired, which of course makes him resistant to bedtime. As I was carrying him past my oldest's door (which is perpetually closed) he asked to see his big brother. I knocked and asked my oldest if he would talk to his baby brother. This aloof, too cool for everything teenager got up and held his baby brother and comforted him, rocking and talking to him until he was calm enough to accept his own bed. In a house, normally full of chaos and bickering, I saw in this small gesture that there is real love between these brothers despite the significant age gap.",SedativeCorpse,251,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/CasualConversation/comments/i7mcfx/my_teenager_made_me_so_proud_tonight_with_a/,4 boy ranging age 3 14 tonight 3 year old wa tired course make resistant bedtime wa carrying past oldest door perpetually closed asked see big brother knocked asked oldest would talk baby brother aloof cool everything teenager got held baby brother comforted rocking talking wa calm enough accept bed house normally full chaos bickering saw small gesture real love brother despite significant age gap,teenager made proud tonight simple gesture,sedative corpse
"After 30 years of being open, my family’s restaurant is closing tonight.","My family has owned a fine dining italian restaurant since before i was born. Most all of my childhood memories are in that restaurant. Everyday after school i’d go do my homework at the bar, i’d follow my dad around the kitchen and help with little things like making salads, and i will never forget making my first pizza at 4 years old. Whenever it stormed really bad and we lost power my family would go and sleep on the floor in the dining room — it was always a safe space. It was always somewhere for us to go, something for us to do, something that needed constant watering and attention. It’s been my family’s livelihood for my entire existence. It’s kept my belly full as well as my heart. It’s my father’s lifelong work and it’s made me respect him sooo much after 30 years of being there to cook for 14+ hours a day. I don’t know who i’d be without this restaurant. It’s shaped me in ways that i couldn’t possibly explain over a reddit post. It’s made me confident, brave, not scared of a little heat, and i’ve built incredible relationships with a staff that i’ve been so lucky to work with for so long. 

I started taking it seriously when i was about 15. I was a busgirl at first. And then i was a hostess. And when i got a little older i became a server. I wasn’t very good at that one, especially after spilling red wine on one-too-many older women and embarrassing myself beyond compare. I realized at 18 or so, that like my father, i was a cook. I’m 24 now and i’ve been cooking alongside my dad everyday since i realized i had a knack for it. It’s been beautiful, exhausting, exhilarating, very mentally and emotionally taxing — just an overall whirlwind of emotions every single day. I even made the crazy decision to drop out of college to run the restaurant full-time. I love it though. I love working with my family. I love making people happy and seeing them enjoy the food we work so hard to make. 

Tonight is our last shift ever. Things were going so well over the holidays this past winter but ever since covid hit, it’s been a different story. We had to close to the public for 3 months. And since we’ve been open with limited occupancy, we’re not pulling in those great numbers that we once were. We can no longer afford the rent at our building and had to make the tough decision to close our doors for good. But besides that, it’s time. My parents are in their 60’s. My dad can’t do it anymore. His health is starting to drastically fail because of all the years being constantly on his feet. and he doesn’t want me to have the same life that he did, never being able to give any part of life besides work real attention. My mom and dad are ready to retire and i don’t blame them. 

I’m nervous about tonight. After all these years, this very well might be the last restaurant shift i ever work. I don’t know what the future holds for me, but i don’t think i have any interest continuing my cooking career elsewhere. I decided that without the restaurant, there’s not much keeping me in our town so in October i’m going to take a big risk and move across the country. I’m terrified. I’ve been terrified every day leading up to today. It’s hard to imagine what life is going to be like for me after we close our doors tonight. I’ve just never known anything else. 

I thought it might feel good to tell this story to some faceless strangers. If you read this far, thank you. 

Please continue to support your locally-owned restaurants. The families who own them put a lot of blood, sweat, and tears into running them. Tip your servers well. Thank the chefs if you run into them. Enjoy good food for the rest of your life and eat it with passion. Cheers and buon appetito.

EDIT: the response from this has been absolutely INCREDIBLE. thank you so much for this amazing outpour of love. the shift just ended. i’m sitting in the office alone and thinking about it all, reading these amazing messages from people all across the globe. you’re all wonderful and if it’s any consolation, you’ve made my heart feel so warm. i feel a bit in shock and ready to drink some tequila and enjoy the rest of the night with my coworkers in true restaurant fashion. i’m going to try to respond to all of you in due time. thank you so much. 

2. since this blew up i thought i’d shoot my shot and say i’m planning on moving to Pittsburgh in october. i don’t have a job lined up so if anyone has any openings, let me know! i’m a hard worker and terrified to move with no plans. i just know it’s time to get out of South Carolina. also if you live in pittsburgh and are looking for a new friend, also message me! i don’t know anyone there and would love to meet some of you Yinzers.

3. a lot of people saying they don’t understand how we don’t have enough money to stay open after 30 years. you need to understand that my parents are old. they do have money put aside. but we moved into a newer, bigger location 5 years ago and our asshole landlord doubled the rent 2 years ago. my parents have been putting money from their own pockets into the restaurant for the last year or so. they could keep it up for a few more years, sure. but then they’d lose all their retirement money. the future of restaurants, especially fine dining, is very uncertain right now. my parents would rather retire now and be able to live off their profits for a few years, than put all their remaining money into it for the next 5-10 years and then have nothing. it’s clearly a big decision we’ve been going back and forth on for the past few months. we came to this decision. i respect them for pulling out now at the end of our 5 year lease instead of risking it all. they deserve this. they deserve retirement. it’s time for them to rest and enjoy their time together.

4. so many people are asking why a random place like pittsburgh. i don’t know. i’ve been obsessed with PGH since i was in early highschool and just haven’t been able to get it out of my head. i like the bridges. i like the neighborhoods. i like the hills. i like the parks. and the cobblestone roads. PNC park is the most beautiful ballpark in the country. i love the pride pittsburghers have for their city (something that i never quite felt from the town i grew up in, regardless of the restaurant). i think it’s the most beautiful city in the united states. my favourite artist in the world, mac miller, is from there. it’s a city but it’s not this huge sprawling metropolis like chicago, or NYC, or philly, or LA. i want to be cold. i want to meet strangers with funny accents and have them show me the secret spots in the city. i want to fall in love with pittsburgh like how the people who have lived there their whole lives love it. why not pittsburgh? it seems like the perfect place for me.

I’ve been living in Japan for more than a decade now. I’m here if anyone has a question about life in this country!,"First of all, I’m not Japanese. I came to Japan about 12 years ago to work as a programmer in Tokyo as a contractual job. A couple years of that and I felt I love it here, so I decided to live in Japan and took a full-time job.

Fortunately, my personality fits the culture and I feel like I’m thriving here. There are pros and cons in every single country, of course, and Japan is no exception. But I feel the pros outweigh the cons, so I’m a bit biased. 

I’ve lived in both the urban metropolis and the provincial rural towns. My current neighborhood is a suburb that’s somewhere in the middle. Less than an hour from central Tokyo, yet surrounded by forests and mountains, two rivers, and everything is walkable.

I realized that there are a lot of people on Reddit who are interested in Japan, both lovers and haters. If you have anything you want to know, I’ll try to answer it with what I know and have experienced.

If you’re not comfortable in making your post public, you can just send me a private message, too!",BeardedGlass,18,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/CasualConversation/comments/i2qm0b/ive_been_living_in_japan_for_more_than_a_decade/,first japanese came japan 12 year ago work programmer tokyo contractual job couple year felt love decided live japan took full time job fortunately personality fit culture feel like thriving pro con every single country course japan exception feel pro outweigh con bit biased lived urban metropolis provincial rural town current neighborhood suburb somewhere middle le hour central tokyo yet surrounded forest mountain two river everything walkable realized lot people reddit interested japan lover hater anything want know try answer know experienced comfortable making post public send private message,living japan decade anyone ha question life country,bearded glass
