,CasualConversation,"Lately I’ve noticed many guys around my circle and on the internet that are very self conscious about how tall they are. And that they often, unfortunately made bad experiences with girls who only date „super tall“ i.e. at least 6‘ guys. Whose girls, are not people who you want to be with. 

Let me just say to you, that it truly does not matter how tall you guys are. Really. In the end, it comes down to what kind of person you are. If they can’t appreciate you then they are not worth it. And if they reject you for that only then you are not the „problem“. 

I mean as a 5‘ girl I couldn’t care less how tall you are. So don’t beat yourselves up! 

Anyways, I hope you guys stay safe!

Edit: for my fellow Europeans 6‘ is about 182cm and 5‘ is about 150-155 cm

Edit 2: For all the tall women comes a similar stigma just the over way around. Either way you are valid and nothing less! If people can’t appreciate you for who you are they are not nice people!

Edit 3: Yes, it is totally fine to have preferences! Maybe I phrase it a lil shitty (English is not my main language) but and I mean BUT, when you make someone feel like they are not valid because of something they can’t control is not nice! (it’s just my opinion, feel free to disagree/criticise)

Edit 4: I tried to respond to everyone as much as I could but at this point I wish you all well! And sorry if I don’t respond to everyone’s message! 

Edit 5: And don’t shy away to criticise, some things are not obvious to me and I can always learn from others. Seeing others perspectives can be very helpful!

,CasualConversation,"I was at a Halloween party with my best friend, Chelsea, and she had some other friends over. This girl Michelle and I were talking and I was telling her and Chelsea a story. I can’t even remember what story it was, but half way through Chelsea said “you already told us this!” She didn’t mean it harshly at all, she likes to play

And then I remembered I told them the same story and they were both in front of me! So I was like Michelle, why didn’t you stop me sooner? 

Her reply was so sweet. She said, “well, if someone tells me something for a 2nd or 3rd time, clearly they care a lot about the story or fact so of course I’m gonna listen and act like it’s the first time I’ve ever heard it because it must mean a lot to them if they talk about it often”

This girl Michelle and I were talking and I was telling her and Chelsea a story. I can’t even remember what story it was, but half way through Chelsea said “you already told us this!” She didn’t mean it harshly at all, she likes to play&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And then I remembered I told them the same story and they were both in front of me! So I was like Michelle, why didn’t you stop me sooner? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Her reply was so sweet. She said, “well, if someone tells me something for a 2nd or 3rd time, clearly they care a lot about the story or fact so of course I’m gonna listen and act like it’s the first time I’ve ever heard it because it must mean a lot to them if they talk about it often”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was a bit surprising but such a precious moment! We stopped everything we were doing and I tried my hardest l to make him a champion at the game in just a couple of minutes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I know it might not be as surprising to other people, but this made my day and I thought I would share it with you guys :D&lt;/p&gt;

,CasualConversation,"(just for some context, I am a 20 year old female) So shaving my head is something I've been wanting to do for a while now. I think it's just something that would be such a cool change and it's been on my bucket list for years.

I bring it up sometimes around my family and my sister is all for it. My parents, on the other hand, always turn their noses up and hate the idea. (which honestly, makes me feel like doing it even more) But, here's the thing... I already don't have much luck in the relationship department and I want boys to like me...

Another thing is that I kinda want long hair for college just so I'm not growing it out awkwardly if I shave it now (who knows, maybe wouldn't even grow it back out).

,CasualConversation,"I have been thinking about this a lot lately. I am very much a pushover, ever since I was a child. I say I am sorry so many times a day for things I have no reason to be sorry for. I have let friends, family, partners, and nearly anyone else push me around and rarely had the confidence to stand up for myself.

Back in middle school, I met a girl when I started 6th grade. We were in the same class and from the moment I met her, she just rubbed me the wrong way. She was outgoing and funny, I was quiet and shy. She could get along with anyone and everyone, I barely had one friend, who I feel was mainly friends with me because I would let her do whatever she wanted. The new girl ( I will call her C) started in on me after about a week of school. She would loudly include me in conversations with other people I wasnt comfortable with. She gave me a nickname due to my pale skin and red  hair that I felt was malicious. Small things like this went on until about halfway through 7th grade.

C greeted me in the morning ""Hey 'nickname' why do you look so crabby? Whats wrong?"" I saw this as a personal attack and finally snapped.

""C dont call me that! I dont like it, stop picking on me etc etc"" (I cant remember the exact conversation) but I had it. I was red in the face and embarrassed for speaking out immediately. She just smiled and grabbed me in a huge hug. I may not remember every detail, but I will always remember what she said next

""Finally! You finally stood up to me. You're so strong and a great person, I wanted you to stand up for yourself and see how you don't have to let people walk all over you""

I was shocked. I started to recall all the times I thought she was picking on me. She wasn't. She was trying to include me. The nickname she gave me? I then realized she gave all of her friends nicknames.
We have been best friends ever since. I can still be a pushover, but whenever I feel it coming on, the fear of standing up for myself, I remember her smile, hug and words.

,CasualConversation,"Calling it a novel feels weirdly pretentious, but it's getting a bit too long to be reasonably called a short story, so a project it is. 

&amp;#x200B;

I've liked to write ever since I was a kid. It was the one form of artistic expression I connected the most with, and even when I wasn't writing for one reason or another, I always felt that itch to put words to paper, to tell the story that was trapped at the back of my mind. And I want to be clear that I have no pretention to be actually good at it; hell, I don't even particularly want to get published, nor share my stuff with anyone else. I just like writing. 

&amp;#x200B;

But I've always had this problem: I'd have an idea for a setting and charcters that I loved, I'd start writing it and then I'd just... stop. Not because I'd loose interest, but because I just didn't know how to take the story further. I knew what I wanted it to look like in the end, but I had no idea how to get there. I didn't know how to build a story, really. And so, for years and years, dozens of projects have sat abandoned in my hard drive, collecting metaphorical dust because I was like a gardener with a seed and no idea how to turn it into a plant. 

&amp;#x200B;

Recently, I got fed up with this pattern. And so I figured, fuck it, if I'm not going to be naturally good at it, then I'll just have to figure it out the old-fashioned way: hard work. And that involved research. A lot of it. (By the way, there is a joke to make about someone reading a book about how to write books.) And you know what? It payed off. Learning how stories are structured - and, more importantly, that there's a method to it - was like being handed the tools and the blueprints I desperately needed to build my house. 

&amp;#x200B;

I feel like, when it comes to any kind of artistic venture, we all have this belief that talent is key, and maybe it is, but I think we also forget that most art forms are also a craft. And you can't wing a craft. Not being able to do so doesn't make you stupid, or untalented; it just means that you're a normal person that can't magically pull knowledge from the ether. 

&amp;#x200B;

After this particular bit of soul-searching, I got to work, and, lo and behold! I have the entire plot of my project planned out, all major scenes outlined with what I want them to do to move things along. It might be crap (it's probably crap; all first drafts are), but I don't even care at this point, because I actually did it. 

&amp;#x200B;

Over the course of lockdown, I've been procrastinating and only focusing on my mood and doing things I want to do like socialising with friends, playing guitar etc. Unlike most people though, when I complete work I dont feel satisfied or like I achieved something, I just feel frustrated and angry. Over some months, this became a problem. 

This past week I've been thinking: ""I wont be able to finish this amount of homework in a week, so screw it."" 

I dont know what's going to happen tomorrow and I am quite anxious. What's going to happen? Will they shout at me? What will my family think? Will I be expelled or suspended? I have only one explanation for this.

,CasualConversation,"I’m sitting at a Starbucks right now &amp; I just had this overwhelming feeling of gratitude when getting a whiff of a pumpkin spice latte that passed me.

When I was in University, I was utterly depressed and lost in life. I was a barista at a Starbucks during University and although I remember fun times working there, I had a lot of issues going on at home and with my relationship. At some point I was close to failing out of University too. When I started to get my shit together, I spent a lot of time at another Starbucks in a town between my Uni &amp; home to study, &amp; I had quit my barista job at the other cafe. I spent hours &amp; hours at this Starbucks studying to try to graduate. Not knowing if I even would.
After graduation, I worked at a company where I was constantly put down &amp; paid very little. When I was laid off, I had to start job hunting again. Spending every other weekend of 8 months in the Starbucks again to job hunt.

Today I sit in a Starbucks in Europe to study for a graduate course I’m taking. I’m here because my company relocated me to help open a branch of our team here, &amp; I’m in graduate school online. I’m living a life that I wouldn’t have been able to imagine just a few years ago because I just kept failing at everything I did.

I don’t want this to come off as bragging, rather just a proclamation of how grateful I am of where I am now. My friends often tell me I suffer from the Imposter Syndrome where I never acknowledge that I worked hard to get where I am. But today I want to acknowledge that. I did work hard to get here, &amp; I’m proud of it. I still have many goals to achieve. But this little moment is my moment of gratitude &amp; acknowledgement that I didn’t succumb to the failure everyone was telling me was coming before.

In my country English is the lingua franca and you're looked down upon if you don't speak English. I really hate this idea but its became a deeply ingrained part of our culture. A lot of times, urban rich people go out of their way to flex their English skills ie speaking with a fake American/British accent, pretending they don't understand the native language, or just being generally snobby about it.

Anyway, then there also people who don't speak English that well and feel visibly self-conscious about it (mostly old people, poor urban workers, those who went to a non-English school).

When I needed someone to talk to, my friends from Twitter helped me. They offered me support and advice. I'm sure that most of my IRL friends won't listen to me (well some would).

,CasualConversation,"A few week ago, my sweetie was up late watching tv and had the door open to let in a cool night breeze (we have a screen door so bugs don’t come in). All of a sudden, he gets quite a scare when some unseen force thumps on the screen door! And then up pops this little kitty face, paws up on the door and all. Well, after his heart stopped racing he went out into the front stoop to meet this kitty visitor who is very sweet and playful, rolling around and just generally being cute. Well, he takes some pics and videos and shows me the next morning and I am DEVASTATED bc I was asleep and missed the whole thing! 

Earlier this week, almost a month later, kitty comes back! Sweetie texts me, saying “I know you’ve just gone up to bed, but kitty visitor is back!” So I jump out of bed, throw on a sweater and go to meet our late-night guest. Now something to note at this point is that I am not really a cat person. I didn’t grow up with cats, and I find them a bit unnerving and unpredictable. But oh my god. This cat!!! It just love to come and rub against us, meows and chit chats with us, and is generally so cute and floppy and sweet!

All of a sudden, he gets quite a scare when some unseen force thumps on the screen door! And then up pops this little kitty face, paws up on the door and all. Well, after his heart stopped racing he went out into the front stoop to meet this kitty visitor who is very sweet and playful, rolling around and just generally being cute. Well, he takes some pics and videos and shows me the next morning and I am DEVASTATED bc I was asleep and missed the whole thing! &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Earlier this week, almost a month later, kitty comes back! Sweetie texts me, saying “I know you’ve just gone up to bed, but kitty visitor is back!” So I jump out of bed, throw on a sweater and go to meet our late-night guest. Now something to note at this point is that I am not really a cat person. I didn’t grow up with cats, and I find them a bit unnerving and unpredictable. But oh my god. This cat!!! It just love to come and rub against us, meows and chit chats with us, and is generally so cute and floppy and sweet! It’s come by three nights in a row now, always around 10pm so I’ve started to expect it haha. I’ve grown very attached, and given it the nickname “cookie” bc they’re my little late night treat. &lt;/p&gt;

,CasualConversation,"Well today was supposed to be a normal day. I was going to go on a hike and enjoy the nice weather but I got blindsided with some news that I wasn't expecting. 

I live away from home but my teen brother still lives with my mom and dad. He pretty much just called me out of the blue today upset about some news my dad shared with him. Basically when my dad was young and in college he dated a girl very briefly. They break up when my dad dropped out of school and moved away and soon after she found out she was pregnant. She asked my dad to come back and confirm it's his, and she swore up and down that it was. He said no. He didn't want to know and didn't sign up for it.

Fast forward and the baby girl is born. The mother is on her own and called my dad to let him know. She asked him to come at least see the baby. He said no again. She tells him the little girls name anyway and they had an argument because the mother decided to put the baby up for adoption.

Then basically my dad moved on and never heard from them again. I don't know why he decided to tell my brother or why he did what he did. He was young and too immature I guess but it's just kind of shocking. Our family is still complete and fairly close together so it's kind of hard to imagine I have a sister out there who my dad basically abandoned.

The hardest part is that there is 0% chance my brother and I will find her. Her name was super common, she was born in a state 8 hours away, and was put up for adoption too. She would be in her 30s now if she is alive. My dad didn't answer all of my brothers questions about it either.

I don't want help finding her it's just hard to take all of this on so suddenly. 2020 has been weird, man.

,CasualConversation,"You know those little periods of time when the song you're listening to seems to be too fast or too slow and you can't shake the feeling that it's different somehow? I get those a lot, and it's always really weird for me. It's hard to enjoy listening to a song when it slips into the musical uncanny valley and feels all wrong.

Some songs that this affects a lot for me are Treasure by Bruno Mars, which often sounds way too slow, Hotel California by The Eagles, which usually seems too slow by just enough for it to be disconcerting, and Cool for the Summer by Demi Lovato, which nearly always seems sped up to the extent that I can't really even listen to it without immediately thinking that something is wrong.

Of course, most of the time, when I listen to those songs (and others) it seems to be a-okay, but there are days when I can't listen to anything at all without the tempo feeling weird. Yesterday was one of those days, and after only an hour or so of flicking through my playlists looking for something that seemed normal, I just gave up and stopped listening to anything at all.

,CasualConversation,"This happened earlier tonight. I’ll try not to make this too long.

We are two college students living in a student apartment together. We both cook often and so the trash can in out kitchen fills up kind of fast.
It’s the ones with the little step on the bottom so the top opens up. 

My roommate was cooking his dinner and since the trash can was getting full he said that he was going to take it to the dumpster outside our apartment when he was done. I took out the trash at least three times before and said ok sure. Afterwards I took a shower. 

After I got out, I got a text from a friend saying if it was ok for them to come over to use the internet for work. I said ok and cleaned up my room for them to use. I noticed that the small trash can in my room was filling up so I decided to put it in the kitchen one since my roommate was going to take it out. When I stepped on the little lever to open it up, the the trash was taken out and a new bag was in. 

My first thought was “oh cool, he took out the trash, nice”. But shortly afterwards I realized he couldn’t have taken out the trash. The dumpster has a lock on it so only residents can open it. But roommates have only one trash key between us and I always have it with me. I asked if someone opened up the dumpster for him, he put it somewhere outside or had it in his room but he just said that he was in his room the entire time after he made food.

He thinks that I’m lying and I swore to him that I didn’t take it out because he said he was going to do it. We did leave the front door unlocked so someone could’ve come in. But who would come inside to change the trash? My laptop was in the living room out in the open too so they could’ve taken that instead of the trash? I really have no fucking idea. I even looked under my bed and in my closet to see if anyone snuck in while I was in the shower and my roommate was in his room. Just to let you know, we cannot have guests over due to COVID and we know absolutely no one else here except for the friend that needed to do work.

I looked up a lie detector place online and I am calling them up tomorrow. I told my roommate that I would put it on speaker so I can make an appointment to prove to him that I’m not lying and that we have a fucking ghost maid living in our apartment. We made a bet of $100 but my roommate is on the fence whether or not I am telling the truth.

,CasualConversation,"I will not say at all that I’ve had a difficult life, just that I’ve gone through some difficult things. 

I went through some pretty extreme trauma during my undergrad and had to drop out of college and abandon my dream job path (after 3 years and being a standout student). I recovered and finished my degree at another local private college, but had to settle for a similar but not practical degree. I did get to fulfill my dream of being a cheerleader for that college, which led me into becoming a professional football cheerleader. 

Still, I’ve been lost trying to find a new career path. Two years after graduation, I decided to do a Master’s in a completely different field. I’m about to start that, but money has been incredibly tight for me. I was on my last $20, being told that I was every job’s second choice after solid interviews (once I was 2nd out of 200+!), and was planning on moving back home. I was out of job leads, out of my emergency fund, and out of time. 

I’ve been praying, manifesting, and trying. Two separate employers have reached out to me and we’re speaking about part time hours. If I can get both jobs, I’ll be okay. If I can just get one, I can still figure something out. 

Today, my sign: I was still concerned about my $20 bank account. I just checked and saw $250 from the state. Apparently my taxes had been filed wrong and they owed me. 

This was just the boost I needed to hold on for these last few weeks until I can hopefully get a paycheck in. I can buy some groceries and gas (and paper towels!!) and can pick up more food for my kitten. 

This honestly feels like the universe threw me a wildcard just when I was out of options. I could cry knowing that everything will be okay in my eleventh hour. I’ve been speaking out loud saying I am grateful for my many blessings and I know the universe has a plan for me, and here we are.

Hello everyone. First off I would like to wish you a beautiful morning,evening,day,night wherever you may be.

I'm a 28 year old Medical student bored out of his mind; I would like to people who are married as they can offer fresh insight into lifes ups and downs. I remember having a penpal as a teenager although i wasn't too crazy about it; ive decided to give it another shot :)

I enjoy long walks at night, walks and hiking in nature, Psychologoical thriller movies, horror movies; conspiracy theories; indie music; non mainstream music; and art. I believe we can find an interest which we share in common as my interests are as vast as the universe :). I have pet snail; yes; a pet snail; hes ugly and BIG (huge actually the size of a Banana) but don't let that scare you; He won't eat you; he only eats squash :). His fav meal.

I'm a fairly open minded; friendly person; though the corona lockdown has made me become a bit of a hermit; perhaps you can help change that; let our friendship blossom into something beautiful! I look forward to hearing from you; once again wish you a colorful and wonderful day. Ciao =)

Got one of the puppies my parents bred and flew it here in May. Next, my girlfriend moved in with me and we’ve been living together for a couple months now. It’s the first time I’ve lived with a SO.

Most recently I finally checked on the “fluid” I had in my right knee, probably from an injury sustained in high school soccer. The doctor said it was the size of two walnuts (side note but doctors have the weirdest length scales when it comes to tumors) MRI, XRAYs, specialists and finally an oncologist telling me that it would be best to take it out. I was lucky though. It was a big sucker, but just under the skin, thankfully outside of my knee, and was most likely benign.

Well come time for the surgery and it only lasted 10 min, but left a 6 inch incision. Very thorough and was surprised he left any for me, but it was all over with at least. Recovery wasn’t too bad. I had to push myself bending my knee in order to avoid any PT. It hurt, but it wasn’t so bad.

Finally, I go for my follow up almost 3 weeks later only to find out the pathology wasn’t done yet... weird but whatever. I then got a call 2 weeks after from a nurse saying that the doctor would be calling me later and that they had been discussing my diagnosis in a medical conference all morning.... erm what?

Turns out the tumor was one with less than 100 well documented cases, angiomatoid fibrous histiocytoma (needs a new name.

Anyway continuing with the incident at hand. A 3rd person had a birthday today and i, well, let's just say arranged the birthday to be celebrated somewhere the two fighting could talk... Which they did and i was so happy at the end when people who weren't even talking to each other ended up like the old days. And even said goodbye 😬. Which is progress trust me...

And even then, somehow I don't know why I'm feeling blue when i should be proud and be happy for them...

Is this normal or am i just broken?

Also for refference- someone just called me insensitive a couple of days ago... So any thoughts???

,CasualConversation,"So many post about height going on here, and it just made me think that we as humans have created such a negative impact on each other regarding our physical attributes. 

I am 5'6 (average according to most standards) and sadly a little on the porky side but hey I suppose if it bothered me that much I would change it. 

Dating is practically a dead zone in my life most of my friends are abroad so my circle of influence is very limited and I would go so far as to say I am a loner. 

Socially I am outgoing and can relate or speak to anyone. I have very little judgement of people.  We all are trying to survive I guess. 

What really gets to me though is why have we become so judgemental? 

Why do we learn towards more negative environments and why do so many more people, every day feel so horribly alone? 

I read the tinder and dating over subs reddits and it really makes me wonder how 8 million people can be so connected but so disconnected at the same time. 

Are we losing touch with our own selves? Have we managed to skip over the ability to create connections?

,CasualConversation,"It's a bit of lie...I actually went to the dentist 6 months ago, but he was so awful that it hardly counted as a dental visit. It did, however, finally give me the nerve to go see a real dentist.

First, he didn't even floss all my teeth and the brushing they did equated to what I could do at home.

**Second, at the end of the visit he freaking dipped his fingers in vaseline and rubbed them all over my mouth. WTF!!**

So, my parents convinced my childhood dentist (who isn't taking patients) to take my husband and me as his patients. He's a really good dentist, but he's been a little tough on me when I was visiting more regularly (around 2008) because I wasn't as regular with flossing as I should be. He (lightly) sprayed me in the face with the water once because he was convinced I should have a cavity, eek! haha.

I was terrified of going to see him last week. I told him I am genuinely more worried about disappointing him than I am about disappointing my own parents, lol. He said he was just mad that I've only gone to the dentist once in since 2013.

Since becoming a trucker, I’ve lost contact with the few friends I did have, and now I just drive and go home. Becoming a trainer in my company is kind of a big deal as they don’t let anybody become one. Have to get a few recommendations beforehand. 

As far as 5 years sober, does it really matter if nobody cares if I’m a drunk or not anymore? It does to me, and it’s one of the very few things I’m proud of in my life.

,CasualConversation,"This is a thought experiment inspired by the fact that the international quarantine efforts have also had the effect of reducing our environmental impact at least for as long as the lockdown lasts.

By ""essential"" I mean activities or things that humans need to survive and function on a basic level, so healthcare, basic nutritionally sufficient food, water, education, things like that. Those would be the only things you're allowed to do or have in this situation. So no movies or TV shows, gaming, toys, luxury items or ""status symbols"", decorations, Reddit, etc. Basically no more entertainment or luxury. Things that already exist can still be used, but not if they require constant energy input (like non-essential websites or gaming consoles), and when they break, they much be disposed of in the least environmentally impactful way possible, but the main point is that we would no longer spend resources on making any more of them. Humanity would basically become as frugal as possible. This wouldn't be returning to when humanity had no technology (that would actually increase our environmental impact and also cause needless suffering), but simply using and developing technology only in ways that aid our survival, nothing else.

By eliminating the things we don't absolutely need, our environmental footprint would go way down, which would obviously be beneficial for the Earth and reduce the probability that humanity destroys itself by destroying the world we live in. Life would be dull in this scenario, and we'd basically be saying good bye to the modern entertainment saturated lifestyle enjoyed by many people, possibly forever. But in exchange we'd be giving us as a species the best shot at not going extinct from our own actions by reducing our actions to only those we can't live without. It would also have the secondary effect of allowing us to focus our resources on things we actually need.

,CasualConversation,"Alright, let's go about two years back in time to explain this. I had been texting a person on reddit for quite a long time, and they started to ask me to show a pic of myself. I had a freshly created, blank Reddit account, so I just updated my profile picture with an image of myself, I let her see it, and then I removed it (because I wanted my account to be anonymous). I thought that would have been it, to be honest.

My profile picture has remained blank ever since, I don't know why, but I never bothered to add one haha

Skipping forward to today, I wrote a comment on a post of one of my reddit friends. He then messaged me, saying there was something strange: ""I got a notification with an image of someone on it, is that you?"" He sends me the screenshot, and YES, in the notification he got from my comment, you could see that image in my profile icon, without me ever adding it! I was quite shocked, I usually very rarely send pics of myself to people I meet online, and Reddit just did it without me wanting to! This is so creepy, I'm assuming the image has always been on the servers, and there was some kind of bug?



Also, just to make it clear, it wasn't that big of a deal. I would have eventually revealed my face too (all my other reddit friends did), and in the end, you know, it's just a face. But this really made me think: what we post on the internet, is truly forever, it won't disappear! Even if we delete it, it'll still be on some server somewhere!

I had been texting a person on reddit for quite a long time, and they started to ask me to show a pic of myself. I had a freshly created, blank Reddit account, so I just updated my profile picture with an image of myself, I let her see it, and then I removed it (because I wanted my account to be anonymous). I thought that would have been it, to be honest.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My profile picture has remained blank ever since, I don&amp;#39;t know why, but I never bothered to add one haha&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Skipping forward to today, I wrote a comment on a post of one of my reddit friends. He then messaged me, saying there was something strange: &amp;quot;I got a notification with an image of someone on it, is that you?&amp;quot; He sends me the screenshot, and YES, in the notification he got from my comment, you could see that image in my profile icon, without me ever adding it! I was quite shocked, I usually very rarely send pics of myself to people I meet online, and Reddit just did it without me wanting to! This is so creepy, I&amp;#39;m assuming the image has always been on the servers, and there was some kind of bug?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also, just to make it clear, it wasn&amp;#39;t that big of a deal. I would have eventually revealed my face too (all my other reddit friends did), and in the end, you know, it&amp;#39;s just a face. But this really made me think: what we post on the internet, is truly forever, it won&amp;#39;t disappear! Even if we delete it, it&amp;#39;ll still be on some server somewhere!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Moral of the story: REALLY pay attention to what you post online, because it&amp;#39;s nearly impossible to completely get rid of it, once you do. Especially if it gets shared among many people!&lt;/p&gt;

Because of some events that happened over the months I refused to let my parents, family, and friends hug me.

Today I visited one of my best and only friends from high school, and she is very respectful of my boundaries when it comes to hugs and whatnot. Before I left, she wanted to say goodbye and started a hug but retracted it, but I said “you know what? Go for it.” And she hugged me, I hugged her, for a good minute. I was so happy. I actually hugged someone. And I let her hug me. I cried. Hugs feel so good. I can’t wait to give my parents a hug later tonight.

,CasualConversation,"I was never a studious child. No matter how hard I tried I just couldn't get my grades up, it was like that ever since I started school. I was even asked to repeat a grade when I was 5, because I couldn't read or write properly when most of the class could. Math was a pain and still is lol. My childhood had been taken away so I could focus more on studying and being a better student. I yearned for what other kids had. They had the grades, they had extra curricular activities and they were having fun. They *liked* school. I couldn't understand how they did all that at once. My teachers would yell at me and I was never chosen for anything. This  resulted in terrible social anxiety, which affected my confidence alot. I couldn't even order food without nearly bursting into tears. So I became known as the quiet kid who wasn't even good at her studies.

I always wondered, just what is wrong with me? I try so hard but nothing ever works. I've done everything, extra classes, online tutors, and staying up all night. I couldn't understand it, just why was I never successful? 

By the time 7th grade rolled around, all my classmates left the school so they could go to better schools with bigger names. They all wanted to attend the best school in the country, let's call it ""The It School"". Now, this school was incredibly hard to get into. Even class toppers who applied didn't get in. Thousands of admissions yet only 80 or less got in.  Everyone always wondered, what is it that this school looks for in a student? What is the perfect student for them? That school created a whole market because tutors were there specifically to help kids get in, and most didn't. It was a rat race for that school. 

As I said before, most of the applications are rejected, so everyone applies to different schools with big names but not as big as The It School. My classmates left me, and in was the only one there at my old school which was very small. I still sucked at studying but by 7th grade, my grades were average. Bs and Cs filled my report card with the occasional A. 

Now, 8th grade was a nightmare, I was bullied relentlessly for things I didn't do and rumours were spread about me. This affected my grades terribly and i failed in several subjects including math. I was broken that year. Shattered. 

However, after bullying was over, a spark was lit inside of me. A spark of determination. The next year, I topped each subject, 100 marks in every paper. I turned my life around and won speech competition after speech competition. My anxiety left me entirely. 

Now, the examinations for The It School rolled around, but were postponed sheveral times due to the virus. This year, for the first time, the school changed its criteria. They had always just looked at the entry test results. There was no test this time. It was based purely on luck and a record. I'm telling you, this was the time everyone wished they had done their assignments!

Anyway, just like any other year, 2000+ people submitted their records and just prayed they'd get in. And when the admissions list was put up, most of the city's kids cried. The reason? There were only 20 names on that list. 

Including mine. 


As soon as the list was up, relatives I didn't even know congratulated me. My old classmates who I hadn't spoken to in years had reached out to me and started talking about how I was 'so lucky!!' to have gotten in. Gifts were sent to my house, and boy did I feast on all the cakes sent to me. My dad's co-workers were calling him one after the other to congratulate him on this. Word spread like wildfire.

To be honest, all that attention felt fantastic. After being the stupid kid for nearly all my life, it feels amazing to be showered with praise. To all the kids who struggled just like me: you can do it. We all can do it. Your potential is like a hidden goldmine, untapped. It isn't exactly about working hard, it is about working smart. Find the teaching method that suits YOU. Like Einstein once said, ""Everybody is a genius, but if you judge a fish on it's ability to climb a tree, it will live it's whole life believing that it's stupid. 

I wish everyone the best of luck, and if you've read it this far, thanks for listening to my story. Now I'm just praying I get into med school :D

,CasualConversation,"I’m young to some but 30 has shed some light on this opportunity I reluctantly funded in my early 20’s (honestly almost forgot about it). This 3 piece ‘rock’ band had zero people listening to what I would call a “tried and true” rendition of popular soft rock mixed with a touch of funk influence, (I didn’t care if they didn’t make it, this was my half-ass attempt to manage a band. I’ve always wanted to) but I liked what I heard and I thought it was worth the couple bills to see what they could do.
Let’s call it 5 yrs ago (no record before signing up with them), I helped fund their recordings and merchandise. That was the agreement. All they wanted me there for, right?

WRONG!

I’ll never forget the first jam they had with me present. I ended up sweaty and high off adrenaline from ‘jammin’ on drums with them. Loved the rush and can’t express enough about how positive their connection felt while playing with these established musicians.
Let it be known that my sole goal was to work with them so’s to shove me up there so I can talk with  other, more established artists (hopefully manage). I really don’t have a clue what it takes to make quality music. 

Well tell you what, I can. This 3 piece helped me better understand what I want from music and overall companionship. My favourite experience as an ‘important part’ to the writing process was the in-depth, co-operative feedback we all had for ideas. Like.. let me tell you, when I had a thought to share about a song or idea for whatever (video, promo, post), it was eaten up like hyenas fighting over (what I thought was) a meatless carcass... The fun poked at it, the ‘cringey’ relatable experiences shared and jokes about how true it felt to identify as an unsuccessful part of a band was refreshing as it was confusing. (Didn’t know they were so hard on themselves, learned a lot about them)

I joined this business operating as a ‘casual director/funder’ in a sense, so I could climb my way to a managing position for an upcoming, bigger, better band.

This 3 piece ‘rock’ band had zero people listening to what I would call a “tried and true” rendition of popular soft rock mixed with a touch of funk influence, (I didn’t care if they didn’t make it, this was my half-ass attempt to manage a band. I’ve always wanted to) but I liked what I heard and I thought it was worth the couple bills to see what they could do.
Let’s call it 5 yrs ago (no record before signing up with them), I helped fund their recordings and merchandise. That was the agreement. All they wanted me there for, right?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;WRONG!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ll never forget the first jam they had with me present. I ended up sweaty and high off adrenaline from ‘jammin’ on drums with them. Loved the rush and can’t express enough about how positive their connection felt while playing with these established musicians.
Let it be known that my sole goal was to work with them so’s to shove me up there so I can talk with  other, more established artists (hopefully manage). I really don’t have a clue what it takes to make quality music. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well tell you what, I can. This 3 piece helped me better understand what I want from music and overall companionship. My favourite experience as an ‘important part’ to the writing process was the in-depth, co-operative feedback we all had for ideas. Like.. let me tell you, when I had a thought to share about a song or idea for whatever (video, promo, post), it was eaten up like hyenas fighting over (what I thought was) a meatless carcass... The fun poked at it, the ‘cringey’ relatable experiences shared and jokes about how true it felt to identify as an unsuccessful part of a band was refreshing as it was confusing. (Didn’t know they were so hard on themselves, learned a lot about them)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I joined this business operating as a ‘casual director/funder’ in a sense, so I could climb my way to a managing position for an upcoming, bigger, better band. 
What I learned about investing in little projects like this is that ‘the experience I prepared for is not what the experience had in mind/store for me’&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Proud is how I felt during and after the band’s success.

,CasualConversation,"I was in Hawaii a few years ago and I tried surfing for the first time. I'm not sure what the typical beginner experience is, but these waves weren't too big at all. Big enough to surf, but not so big that a beginner like me wouldn't be able to ride them. It was probably one of the most fun things I've ever done. Every ocean I've been even remotely close to since then, I've always attempted to go surfing (to varying degrees of success) because it is so damn fun.

The problem with all of this is that I'm from the midwest, where the waves are so big that they had to build the cities 1000 miles from the nearest coastline, surfing isn't something I can do regularly out here. I go surfing once or twice a year. I've been making it a point to save some money and make it out to an ocean at least once a year.

This seems like a problem that will hopefully go away soon, as life is currently presenting me with an opportunity to jump ship out here and move to California (relatively) soon.

Whenever I meet someone from the coast that doesn't surf, it annoys me a little bit.

,CasualConversation,"Hi, I'm a single man, 27. Was drinking my hard worked Saturday beer and listened to a very nostalgic song for me. It made me remember the time I moved to another city to study on a public university (believe me, it is very hard to get on one of those in my country and it is very respectable to study on these unis here, something like the Ivy League there in america). I've finished the course but in the middle of it I realized it was not my thing. Talked to my parents who invested time and money for me getting there, so they convinced me to finish it. Well, I finished and never had the opportunity nor the love to pursue a career in it (Civil Engineering, very very hard course, which only its conclusion was a pain in the ass). Came back to my city, after 6 years there. Went when I was 18-19, concluded with 24, going through a hard depression at the time and growing up in general. I've maturated a lot there.

So I graduated and came back to live with my mother. Went unemployed a long time, even with that beautiful public uni diploma. I was grown on that mindset, that only the diploma mattered. It destroyed me, but today I've went through it. Now I'm completing one year employed, yet living with my mother, but the situation is completely different. I plan to move out yet this year if things continue going the way they are.

So today I remembered those living alone times and came to the conclusion how things pass. It has been more than 2 years that i've graduated. The only thing that remains is my diploma and friends I made along the way. I did not retained much of knowledge about civil engineering. It was never my thing. My father, who pursued me to finish it, is really nice with me, but shows no signs of regret about the day I told him to visit me and talk about my dissatisfaction in general.  My family have too put all of that under the carpet. Seems like another life I've lived. I work in administration/accounting field, because of experience with numbers and excel in general, maybe one of few things my graduation gave me. 

So I caught my self thinking how things passed by. That time I was ashamed that so many people put expectations on me and I've failed to deliver. Now seems that even I've started to forget about, as things moved on. I've started a new course on technology/programming area, something that I discovered myself last year. I came to terms with my parents in general, after being unemployed for a time. I know i'm still a disappointment to some of my relatives and even my parents. But I've managed to get over it and have hope to make my on life and be able to help them soon enough. Even now, with a job that don't live up with their (and even mine) expectations, I'm able to give some help where I can.

Well, to finish off this vent out, I want to all you people get the following message: are you dissatisfied with your graduation/job field? Quit it then. Do not force something you know you don't like. I was young and a very manipulated person, specially by my parents. They've done wrong to me yes, but I have my part of the blame too.

Was drinking my hard worked Saturday beer and listened to a very nostalgic song for me. It made me remember the time I moved to another city to study on a public university (believe me, it is very hard to get on one of those in my country and it is very respectable to study on these unis here, something like the Ivy League there in america). I&amp;#39;ve finished the course but in the middle of it I realized it was not my thing. Talked to my parents who invested time and money for me getting there, so they convinced me to finish it. Well, I finished and never had the opportunity nor the love to pursue a career in it (Civil Engineering, very very hard course, which only its conclusion was a pain in the ass). Came back to my city, after 6 years there. Went when I was 18-19, concluded with 24, going through a hard depression at the time and growing up in general. I&amp;#39;ve maturated a lot there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So I graduated and came back to live with my mother. Went unemployed a long time, even with that beautiful public uni diploma. I was grown on that mindset, that only the diploma mattered. It destroyed me, but today I&amp;#39;ve went through it. Now I&amp;#39;m completing one year employed, yet living with my mother, but the situation is completely different. I plan to move out yet this year if things continue going the way they are.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So today I remembered those living alone times and came to the conclusion how things pass. It has been more than 2 years that i&amp;#39;ve graduated. The only thing that remains is my diploma and friends I made along the way. I did not retained much of knowledge about civil engineering. It was never my thing. My father, who pursued me to finish it, is really nice with me, but shows no signs of regret about the day I told him to visit me and talk about my dissatisfaction in general.  My family have too put all of that under the carpet. Seems like another life I&amp;#39;ve lived. I work in administration/accounting field, because of experience with numbers and excel in general, maybe one of few things my graduation gave me. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So I caught my self thinking how things passed by. That time I was ashamed that so many people put expectations on me and I&amp;#39;ve failed to deliver. Now seems that even I&amp;#39;ve started to forget about, as things moved on. I&amp;#39;ve started a new course on technology/programming area, something that I discovered myself last year. I came to terms with my parents in general, after being unemployed for a time. I know i&amp;#39;m still a disappointment to some of my relatives and even my parents. But I&amp;#39;ve managed to get over it and have hope to make my on life and be able to help them soon enough. Even now, with a job that don&amp;#39;t live up with their (and even mine) expectations, I&amp;#39;m able to give some help where I can.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well, to finish off this vent out, I want to all you people get the following message: are you dissatisfied with your graduation/job field? Quit it then. Do not force something you know you don&amp;#39;t like. I was young and a very manipulated person, specially by my parents. They&amp;#39;ve done wrong to me yes, but I have my part of the blame too. At least I learnt that I will never put my son in these type of situation. People have the right to live their on dreams, not the dreams of others, even if that &amp;#39;others&amp;#39; are their parents or grandparents. That f*cked me up for a long time. Have a good weekend you all and happy independence day for us Brazilians!&lt;/p&gt;

,CasualConversation,"So, for a while now I thought my friend, we'll call A, had two instagram accounts and just switched between them once in a while. But, the second account, As, was kinda suspicious since the first time it messaged me. It had awful grammar, compared to my friend who always had perfect grammar. Honestly, a month ago that was the only information I had to go off and I just assumed that it was my friend but writing lazier than usual.

Fast forward to today. I often ask my friends to look over assignments I do to see if they make sense and answer the questions asked. I messaged As asking for help and it said ok. About 5 hours later I had no response so I messaged A and As if they got it and A said no.

I showed the email I sent my work to and A said that she didn't have that email, only a similar one she hasn't used in years. Then we got suspicious and found that As was an impersonator. I asked A some questions like favorite color (pink), my favorite band (MCR), if she had a sister (no).

I asked As the same questions and she only got MCR right. As even tried saying that she had a half sister and wanted to go to colorado and learn Portuguese.

We reported the account and I have no idea who it is. It may be some old creep thinking I'm a girl and wanting to kidnap me. I don't know, but I feel proud. We reported the account and hopefully all works out. It was weird.

So yeah, that was crazy. I'm glad I caught the scammer. Thanks for reading!

It is the 5th of September today. Which, in our country, is celebrated as Teachers’ day. You will come across various students posting statuses, pictures, and videos dedicating to their respective teachers as all of our educational institutions are currently shut and nobody is able to personally visit their teachers to thank them. Even social media today is filled with similar posts and pictures.

I felt the same urge to thank somebody who I rate highly. He is such a gem of a person that I could go on and on talking about him for hours and I won't be tired. He has helped me immensely not only in the subject which he teaches but also in shaping the way that I think about stuff in my life.

Anyway, so I decided to send him a short message expressing what I thought about him and how well he has been doing his job of being an excellent teacher to me. What he did next was something that I wasn’t really expecting or even prepared for. He replied to my text after a short while saying how thankful he was for my kind words and then immediately proceeded to take a screenshot of my message and posted it on his profile with a caption that said *“****So motivating.****”*.

I was in awe and had to take my time to process all of it. He has never done anything like that for anyone else to this day, which was very apparent when my college mates started texting me saying how lucky I was to be complimented from a professor of his stature.

He replied to my text after a short while saying how thankful he was for my kind words and then immediately proceeded to take a screenshot of my message and posted it on his profile with a caption that said &lt;em&gt;“&lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;So motivating.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;”&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was in awe and had to take my time to process all of it. He has never done anything like that for anyone else to this day, which was very apparent when my college mates started texting me saying how lucky I was to be complimented from a professor of his stature.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m delighted to say the least as this has absolutely made my day.&lt;/p&gt;

I wasn't sure if I'd get anything else done today, but then I remembered that my little sister asked me to cook something with broccoli the other day. I don't actually cook regularly at all, I think the last time was a few months ago. I hate my own cooking and I know how to make 3 things maybe.

So I went to buy groceries, decided that I want to make some broccoli cream soup as my mum makes it sometimes and it seems quite easy, so I asked her about it and most of the process is just boiling broccoli in water.

When I came home, I put the broccoli to cook and I put some clothes to wash. Then I decided that I'd clean around the house.  This I never really do either, unless they ask me. I'm not very close to my family so I don't like cleaning up after them.

I took everything out of the fridge including its compartments, and started cleaning the inside of the fridge. Then I went and washed the parts that I took out, patted them dry and I put them back in.

I then checked what needed to be thrown away from the food items that I took out of the fridge and put the rest of them back in a nice and organised way. I haven't seen my fridge like that in a while. 

I then finished the broccoli soup, and I was actually surprised because my sisters both really liked it, even though they had to ask me to give them more salt twice.

I also washed some dishes, cleaned the dining table and some other things in the kitchen, put my laundry out to dry and folded some other clothes too. I then went to my room and cleaned a bit there too, made my bed etc.

so the car didn't stop and started going the other side to the left where there was a pillar supporting a bridge and a river right next to it, My brain was already in super panic mode by this time and I could see the car was gonna ram into the pillar, on reflex or by sheer dumb luck, I don't know, I somehow managed to stop the car 2-3 meters before the pillar at which point my heart was beating so fast I could actually hear it beating normally

,CasualConversation,"Not just some small imagination world but a large developed imagination universe filled up with history, sports, politics, tv shows and movies, video games, music, and basically anything else. I feel like for a 15 year old who's currently learning how to drive and is in 10th grade it is super immature to have something like this but I feel like I can't help it. Usually every day I'll either ride my bike or bounce a basketball by myself and escape into this place. I'll add details to this imagination like maybe one day I'll create a crazy president who was super controversial or an underdog sports team winning the championship. This place is my escape from the real world and helps me deal with stress and help me feel so relaxed. It all started when I was fourth grade, I thought it was just a fun little thing to do but quickly became a hobby.

,CasualConversation,"So I just began renting a student dorm, in a block there's different sections, and each section there's 5 dorms and a communal kitchen. Booking times for my accommodation were 7 to 8 am. I joined the Facebook group to find a flock of students discussing group chats for their dorms or block to connect with their roommates.

I'm quite excited to meet new people, which is why I bothered paying for private dorms in the first place rather than just living at home with my parents despite the fact that I'm barely that far away from my parent's house to begin with.

It's now currently 8:22 PM and nobody has shown up to my particular section and I'm the only dorm in use. I know it's not just incredibly shy people who haven't come out their room yet because a paper slip with information is lodged into the side of the doors and falls when you first open the door.

I have an entire kitchen to myself, I don't really know what's happening and I hope to fucking God I have roommates at some point, it feels really weird having an entire day to kill with nothing to do.

Before you suggest I go downstairs and mingle you need to really think about that concept yourself. Nobody just waltz over to a random group of people and joins in the conversation in the communal areas, the only real way you make friends properly is by establishing a group and then socialising. Once a group has already been established, you don't just add yourself to that group, it becomes weirdly hard and they'd most likely just ignore you.

What's frustrating, is that my ""group"" is currently missing. I have the entire floor to myself. Nobody is here. I shower with the door unlocked and sometimes take trips to the kitchen with music playing out loud or barefooted or whatever the fuck because I know nobody is going to come in.

,CasualConversation,"Well... Before the quarantine I have a job in a restaurant.

Three days ago, my boss call me to work after 4 month without working at all, and during that time I could'nt pay my rent, but the owner of the house was kinda cool and he told me to pay when all the situation of the quarantine ends.

So... The firts day of job was ok.

The second was mess up because no one expect the amount of client that came to the restaurant, and it was stressful 'cause they were only three employees in the restaurant, two in the kitchen, me in the public. We would'be fine with two persons.

The third day (this one), they told me that other person would be with me, but doesn't came early.

Today, came like 8 tables: the kitchen was a mess. The tables kinda too. And the stress was to much, but I was trying to not be stressfull so the others can be relax at least to me.

The restaurant have two floors, and in some part, the kitchen and the second floor are connected (that place was the site of the guy who makes juices and lemonades and stuff), and I was there preparing four glass of water, and I ask to my partners to give a towel to dry on the glass of water. They ignore me, I ask again and ignore me again. Then, one of the cheft ask me about something that was in that part where I was, and I pass the thing to him, and ask him again about a towel. He call the other guy in the kitchen to pass me napkins, and the guy throw me a pack of napskin in the face.

In that point I was mad and stressed about the whole disorganization of the restaurant that it's fault of the bosses for being lazy in many ways.

So, in that point I just tell the guy that throw the pack in the face that what's his f-- problem, and he told me that he's stress and doing stuff and bla... bla...

In that point, I just take of my uniform and left the job with the 8 tables awaiting being served.

It doesn't felt pleassure. I just felt anger, and I felt like wanna hit something or someone. 

But now I'm calm... And I'm not happy, but I'm glad to have left that place before I kill someone.

Now... I have to find another job xd

Meaby I'll be mess up for my own fault. But I'll be ok in the future.

The employee who was helping us then said that I could come out and help, as there was a lot of stuff, so I dutifully popped on my mask and started to unload the car. 

At which point the employee looked at us and said ""aww it's nice to see a mother taking her son out"". 

Now, I am 3 years younger than my brother in law. So we just stared at him for a second to process what he'd just said before o awkwardly stuttered out that he's my brother in law, not my son, and the employee just laughed and carried on.

I have experience with teaching secondary school kids, but that was with a mentor at another school (so there was always someone helping me). This new class at my school was solely for refugees or children that just entered the country and needed to learn English. 

I was so nervous about my lessons that I couldn't pee, was sweating and moved too much. By the time the lesson ended, I said: the bell will ring in less than a minute, is there anything you want to ask or tell me? And then this really quiet girl responded:' Miss, you're gorgeous.'
Of course I was caught off guard and I don't really reply well to compliments. I was so happy though! Then the students left and another person said:' you're my favorite teacher.'

,CasualConversation,"Thought this might be useful to someone and was also thinking about posting it on a Medical related sub but they don't seem to take kindly to alternative medicine of sorts.

I don't consider it meditation (though I've never meditated before so maybe it is) but how I get rid of it requires a bit of imagination.

It's not always a cure for it either. I just sort of move the pain.

Basically when it's a sharp stabbing pain I close my eyes and focus on where it's located then imagine the pain being spread out. The idea of that is pretty much dilution. The more you spread the concentrated pain the less painful it becomes.

I usually imagine it spreading like a force field in movies or games that gradually wraps around something (in this case, my brain) and the sharp pain dulls.

I'm sometimes left with a dull but manageable headache that doesn't make me want to throw up whatever medicine I try to take or it goes away completely.

It doesn't work very well with migraines though. I can make the pain dissipate a little but it usually comes back unless I'm laser focused all the time.

This might not work for people who actually read this long ass post but it helps me out a lot.

NOTE: It requires ALL your focus over sometimes a long period of time. If you feel it working do *not* stop until you're sure it's at a level you can deal with.

Yesterday night, I was coming back home. While opening the door to insert a key, a HUGE cockroach was flying towards my foot.

Well... today I managed to call one of them, and after a nice walk I gifted the first one! I hope he'll like it. In the evening I'm meeting 3 other friends and maybe I'll be able to finish theirs too today... Gotta work hard!

In the end I decided to go for small tin containers instead of glass jars since they'd break too easily. Some are for pasta, some for spices and some are simply decorated with flowers (for the girls). Inside there is 1 letter addressed to the person and 365 notes (a mix of quotes, funny stuff, activities, compliments and memories). Also depending on the person I add food, a small object or leave it as is.

So yeah, The Giving has begun! I can't wait to give all 10 of them out!

&lt;p&gt;I couldn&amp;#39;t care less about my early school years, except I made a few great friends during that time. It were my last few years that I&amp;#39;ll miss the most. Great friends (whom I&amp;#39;m missing a lot as we will all go out own ways), some (not all) great teachers and all the experiences I had. I&amp;#39;ll try to keep in touch with my friends but the thing is I&amp;#39;m a terrible texter and rarely text first, even though I love talking with them. I didn&amp;#39;t even meet anybody at the school cause I was out of my city when everyone was called to collect the report cards.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So yeah, nothing much just sharing my thoughts :)&lt;/p&gt;

,CasualConversation,"Maybe it was the way I was raised. We grew up eating fresh and frozen vegetables, very rarely canned. I find myself telling my husband and (whoever will listen) what healthy things I ate that day, and ask them what *they ate*. I probably sound like a bitch.

Fresh produce is always best, if you can afford it and have access to it. Fresh tastes superior to frozen or canned in almost everything. Nothing beats a homegrown tomato or radish, but I am ashamed to admit that I *almost* prefer frozen hashbrowns to fresh.

Frozen vegetables are generally ok, I can handle frozen mixed veggies (carrot, corn, pea and green bean medley) sauteed in lot of butter or ghee and with liberal amounts of salt and pepper. Frozen green beans are better tolerated in a green-bean casserole with extra french-fried onions on top.

Canned vegetables to me have an odd texture, and they also look slimy. I can eat some of them if they are prepared and nearly hidden in a casserole. Canned corn smells and tastes odd. I try not to think about the horror of a canned mushroom I found on a pizza when I was a kid. I'm sorry, some things don't belong in a can!

,CasualConversation,"Basically my sister lost her job because she developed mental issues (think paranoid schizo) during the last 8 months.

We were refused boarding twice because of reasons basically out of our control - had tickets canceled 4 times or something insane like that.

,CasualConversation,"I saw a post about someone’s boyfriend being cute and reaching out to them while they were sleeping, and it prompted me to share this as well. 

(apologies for the format as I am on mobile, and this is my first post here)

I have been dating my current boyfriend for about 3 or 4 months, and this week we decided to try something new and go backpacking. I am fairly outdoorsy and have been backpacking several times over the last few years, while my boyfriend went once or twice in high school but has not done much in the way of hiking since. For reference, we are both in our early twenties. But anyway, earlier this week we packed up our things and enough food for three days and drove up to the mountains.

We got there fairly late in the afternoon, and only hiked a few miles before setting up camp. We cooked dinner a little ways down the trail from where we were
sleeping, hung our food up in a tree to make it difficult for any bear or critters to get at it (there are black bears where I live), set up our tent, and got cozy. It was really nice to be with him, and we stayed up talking for a while in the light of my lantern. We went to sleep around 9 or 10, excited for tomorrow and the beginning of our adventure. 

An hour or two after we had fallen asleep, I heard whining/whimpering outside our tent. We both startled awake, heard it again, and realized it must be a black bear cub. Black bears are fairly common in the area, and tend not to be a threat (unless they are continually exposed to people or given food, they are very scared of humans and usually run away when yelled at), but mama bears are a different story. They are very protective of their young, and if they perceive that their babies are in danger, they will do what it takes to protect them. 

So naturally we were terrified. A bear cub outside our tent meant that the mom was nearby, and though we may have been able to scare them away, she also was much more likely to become violent to protect her babies. 

But what stood out to me the most was that when we first heard the bear cub, my new-ish boyfriend, that had very little experience in the way of backpacking and did not know much about bears, /instinctually dove over me/ and started yelling to protect me from the bear. This man woke up from his sleep, scared and in an unfamiliar environment, and his first instinct when threatened was to protect me. I’ve never experienced that before, and I just feel really loved. He told me later he was terrified himself, but he pretended that he wasn’t worried so I would feel safe and be able to sleep.

With this new era of technology,  I feel like anyone and anybody can start making music,  at the palm of their hands for some people. Due to this, I feel like there's going to be a change in music and how it sounds, moving forward. It'll sound more electronic in my opinion, due to beats being made on the computer as opposed to using real instruments nowadays. Not to even think about how ridiculous over priced some instruments can even be, making it hard for some people to even access making some music. 

I dont like the fact that while making music, usually these artists have to put some kind of facade in order to attract the masses. And that's just not keeping it real imo. Why do you have to create this sensational celebrity identity in order to make it to the great spots in the music industry. Because simple. It makes the views. And with many views, comes fame.

,CasualConversation,"Now that I have your attention, I’d like to discuss the 3 Spider-Man movie universes (referred to by the actors names).

In Sam Rami’s Spider-Man trilogy (Toby McGuire), he has organic webbing that he can shoot from his wrists. So for years I thought that’s how Spider-Man was. But then when I saw Andrew Garfield Spider-Man, I said to my sister “I don’t like that he had to make web shooters. It seems like a downgrade!” And she then told me that it was how the comics went. So I thought that was fair enough and in a way kinda cool. But unlike the comics, Andrew Garfield still at least had organic webs, so I assumed that part was also in the comics. But then I found out literally an hour ago that Tom Holland’s Spider-Man (and in the comics) doesn’t even have organic webs. He has to make them as well as the shooters.

So this brings me to 3 different points.

1. The only reason Toby McGuire Spider-Man does the finger thing is because of the comics, but if you think about it, it really makes no sense for him to do that because he doesn’t have to press the web shooter button. So it was technically just a choice he made. (I mean then again there was that little montage where he tried a bunch of different hand gestures and nothing else worked, so they did kind of address the fact that he did the same hand movement despite not having to press a button. Still tho, for what reason would it only work that way and not flat handed? Maybe tendons?)

2. Unless you’re talking about Toby McGuire Spider-Man, the only reason Spider-Man would swing on webs from his ass is if he stuck a web shooter up it. But lmao could you imagine.

3.

Little does she know I put them back where she keeps them so she can retell the story and have the joy of giving me her special rock balls. I would hate for her to not have them one day and get sad because she thinks she’s lost them. She gets so disheartened when she forgets and people have to remind her almost as if it was a nuisance to them. I just wanted to share this for the people who have family members that struggle. I know my grandmas case is very early, I know it will get worse but I will listen to those same stories a thousand times if it means I get to see her smile.&lt;/p&gt;

Took it today and got a perfect 10/10. 

Not a huge deal, but it is the highlight of my week so far. Thought I’d share with someone. 🙂

Edit: I am away from my laptop at the moment, but when I get back to it, I will share some links to some helpful resources I’ve been using. Thank you all for the kind words. 😊

Edit #2: First of all, thanks again for the encouragement and kind words! I wasn't expecting it to blow up like it did, but I hope I can help those that might also be in A+P classes. 

The bulk of what I have studied so far can be found here: https://www.khanacademy.org/science/health-and-medicine/human-anatomy-and-physiology 

The quizzes really helped me, and I use them as a reference point for my flash cards. If KA isn't your thing, check out this link instead: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL8dPuuaLjXtOAKed_MxxWBNaPno5h3Zs8

Personally, I prefer KA because of the quiz function. I find it easier to take the material in little bites - usually reciting the information 3-5 times helps me retain it. 

Someone else mentioned it, but if you are trying to better understand planes (midsagittal, transverse, etc), drawing them yourself is incredibly helpful. It doesn't have to be perfect (mind are not great at all), but they were surprisingly effective.

Finally, if you are in pre-nursing as I am and are considering taking the TEAS test, I strongly recommend a few sources:

ATI TEAS Pocket Prep - Free trial download on Apple's app store 

ATI TEAS Secrets Study Guide - Shop around. You can find digital copies for as low as $6. Make sure you take notes though!

Quizlet has some good flashcards that are already made. These largely cover simple terms. I don't recommend it for helping with diagrams, which there will be a lot of, but it's good to to use for word definitions. There are a lot of different ones available.

,CasualConversation,"I was not born anywhere near the airing of Blackadder, but my interest was piqued when I found it recommended after Mr. Bean. A week after first stumbling on it I reach Blackadder Goes Forth, in the trenches of the Great War. The jaded sarcastic Blackadder no longer wants power, money, fame, or social standing. The fourth series is fully focused on his futile plans to escape the inevitable in the trenches.

**SPOILERS AHEAD**

Amusing, funny, the weight of what Blackadder so desperately wants doesn’t sink in until the last episode. No real plot here, the last few tries to escape are foiled (feigning madness and calling Haig for a final reprieve only to be told to feign madness). Even Darling, that cowardly codling hiding behind his notepad and pyjama folding, cannot escape. It first got dark when we see Darling cry to Melchett to not send him to the trenches, that “the car is already here”. Even the naively patriotic George is scared, for he has no intention to die. They talk of a future that seems happy but that doesn’t seem to exist. Blackadder, the most sarcastic and snarky character, says with genuine care, “Good luck everyone.” He assures Baldrick that his cunning plan must be saved for later, wished luck in a most vulnerable tone, and off they pop into the fog.

Mu eyes sweated for a good ten minutes the first time. It gave me a much more profound appreciation of the first World War. History books give a flat and purely academic view, but the ending was just so much deeper and visceral, because you see these characters with a backstory that is important, to them at least, and the distance (35 miles as Melchett said) between the fighters and the commanders. (not ragging the commanders, it was a new age of war with much different strategies, but damn I wanted to punch Melchett so much; let Darling speak you incapable bottom). George would’ve settled into the country, being the only one of his friends to survive, and Darling would’ve married Doris. 

I feel Darling’s entry into his diary sum the predicaments here nicely: Bugger.

Note also that the laughing from the audience got more unsure, and even when Blackadder made one final crack (Who would have noticed another madman around her?) there is no semblance of laughter. If the episode didn’t have the looming death of the beloved characters it would’ve been a giggle at least. They charge, as the trench fades into a poppy field, assumed to be what remains of the battlefield. Silence. No end credits, no march song, no music. Just the deafening silence punctuated by birdsong. When I said 10 minutes of eye sweat I counted from the end, but they’d begun to perspire when Darling mentioned his wish to marry Doris.

,CasualConversation,"There was a hot debate not long back: does a straw have two holes?

I was pretty adamant in saying it has 1 hole. But the more I think of it, I firmly believe there are two holes in a standard straw.

That is, if the straw itself is longer than the diameter of the hole.

Stay with me here.

A piece of paper with a hole punched in it. That's one hole. Hole is roughly 1/8"" in diameter, however the thickness of the paper is maybe .003""?

&lt;p&gt;That is, if the straw itself is longer than the diameter of the hole.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A piece of paper with a hole punched in it. That&amp;#39;s one hole. Hole is roughly 1/8&amp;quot; in diameter, however the thickness of the paper is maybe .003&amp;quot;?&lt;/p&gt;

,CasualConversation,"I've been wondering recently how other people think and what their inner monologue is like, given they have them. For any who don't know, an inner monologue is the voice inside your head when you think. Not everyone has one, so I was wondering how people's imaginations work.

So to begin with, if I were to ask you to imagine an apple, what would you see? You don't physically see anything, correct? You just know you're picturing an apple? For me, I can perfectly think of a three dimensional apple with all of its irregularities and blemishes. I can rotate it, turn it upside down, imagine a knife and cut into it, see inside, and turn the apple whatever color I want it to be. All of the color differences still remain the same, and there are still size irregularities as a normal apple would. I believe some people are just unable to imagine an apple in the first place? What are you able to see and describe? 

Now are you able to imagine a place? Like your room or a nearby park? I can imagine any place that I've been to, and essentially navigate my way around the area. Almost like a Google Maps Street View, but in my head. I have gaps in my memory for larger areas, but for the most part I can think of a clear picture. Can you only think of the idea of the place? Or can you see it from a third person perspective?

Lastly, what is your inner monologue like? I am always thinking to myself or have a song playing in my head. I think to myself about all kinds of random things with some little voice that goes on in my head, which I imagine sounds like my own voice. However, if I know a person's or a song's voice well enough, I can remember exactly how it sounds and manipulate their voice to make them say whatever they want. If it's a song, they can say whatever, but it has to go along with the song's pitch, tone, rhythm, and all that. I'm essentially replacing the lyrics. What do you all think of, if you have an inner monologue? For those who don't, are you able to describe what goes on in your mind? I've spent a few minutes thinking about what I'm going to include in this post, basically going over what questions I want to ask and the wording, and I'm interested to see how other people think. 

Let me know what you all are able to do and if there are any other questions you have for other people!

,CasualConversation,"Funny to think about that. The last two years have been a blur.

My back is a lot better now. I’ve been doing powerlifting for a little while. For a long time I was playing it safe. Always lifting less than I thought I could, to be safe. In my mind, the Injury felt like it had happened maybe 12 months ago..

I walked in one day and thought “fuck it, Let’s see how high I can go comfortably”

I deadlifted 110kg (242lbs) on a [trap bar ](https://www.ironedge.com.au/chrome-trap-bar.html?gclid=EAIaIQobChMItvbqubHO6wIVm30rCh01JwpBEAQYASABEgIGwfD_BwE) (weight 120kg / 264lbs height 183.5cm / 6.02”).

Two days later I took the leap across to a conventional straight bar. Figured if I’m lifting 110kg on a trap, then I could probably try a lower weight on the normal bar. 100kg was ok, a little to much to work with so I dropped it to 90kg (198lbs). That felt good. 

I wouldn’t say my life has been a consistent upward inspiration story since then, but the trend is good at least. 

I have a better job that serves an important purpose in the community. I feel happy knowing that my job is contributing to saving lives (healthcare worker).

I got diagnosed with ADHD and have been seeing improvement from medication. I meditate more. 

I’m happier single (my ex is a wonderful woman, just not the right one for me). 

I even had my first birthday single in a good 5 years...and it was one of my favourites. I worked out, got invited to a bbq and had dinner with a friend.

I find myself wanting to be cuddled up with a good book and a hot beverage in a hobbit hole in the shire if you catch my drift.

I miss the silence. I miss peace. I miss simpler times.

I remember a while back when there where only the top three. and you actually had to put some effort to earn one. (or repost) Now I wasn't against the idea of adding more awards. It was a fun idea! however, this endless free coins! has totally ruined the point of giving awards. Literally anyone, anything! gives and gets awards. now hopefully this will calm down and when most people run out of coins it should, but right now getting an award seems to be very meaningless.

do you guys think this is gonna get any worse or better?

how does getting an award two years ago compare today

It was a fun idea! however, this endless free coins! has totally ruined the point of giving awards. Literally anyone, anything! gives and gets awards. now hopefully this will calm down and when most people run out of coins it should, but right now getting an award seems to be very meaningless.&lt;/p&gt;

,CasualConversation,"First time poster here, just wanted to share with someone that I finally lost weight without having to go on a massive diet.

I'm 21, male, 198cm (6ft 6). I've always struggled with being overweight, but ever since I left home to go to uni I've been gaining a fair bit of weight, even with going to the gym 3 times a week. I was starting to get a bit of a big belly, started having to buy bigger clothes, and I hated it. It really was taking a toll on my mental health.

Before I went to uni 3 years ago I was just around 100kg (220lbs). Last time I weighed myself was in March at 127kg (280lbs). I wanted to never go over 130kg (286lbs) so I ended getting scared of weighing myself.

This morning, I felt slimmer than usual, got the balls to weigh myself and I'm at 122kg (270lbs)!!!! I never thought this day would happen. I feel so incredibly happy, and it's motivated me loads to continue (without turning to obsession)

I decided to change my habits start of July by just trying to eat less processed sugar. Examples:
-Not having a soda every evening, maybe just water (and a lot of it).
-If I'm hungry at some point in the afternoon, a banana instead of a packet of biscuits or loads of cake
-And the most important of all was to slow down when I'm eating and being ok with not eating desert or leaving leftovers if I feel full up.

Thanks for listening (or reading lmao), just needed to share this with someone, I hope it doesn't look like a ramble!

Each time u have to do something online, seems to be you gotta download an app, create ID linked to an email and a password.   Now every few months u have to change the password.  If you change phones, computer-laptop or desk top, u must re-download and re use the I’d and password which was automatically saved by your old device which made it easy for you but now u can’t access it.  
This drives me crazy and I am super annoyed about it.  I used to have an app in which I saved all my passwords and log in’s.  I changed cellphones from galaxy to iPhone.  The app was downloaded but there was nothing under my saved information.   This was never an issue for ppl of my generation.  You need to pay a bill, it comes in the mail and u send a check back.  No secret if or passwords.  No change of passwords either.  Now my son told me that the iCloud saves the passwords for you.  How do I get to then iCloud password storage?  He does not know how and neither do I.  Does the iCloud keep this a secret from me?  I’m the one who is supposed to manage this.  

I am in my 50s and wanted to track all of this on paper but the anger it induces paralyzes my actions.  I write them down and get overwhelmed by the sheer number of accounts.  
Then the stupid junk mail that comes in feels like I’m being harassed.  I unsubscribe but they keep coming back months later.  

I want to close the damn accounts but in today’s world it seems impossible to function unless u spend 3hrs of ur day online managing ur personal life.  I could be fucking or enjoying a pedicure  and or enjoying the beauty of this world.

,CasualConversation,"Or just something that happened and made you happy.

This year saw many catastrophes but I tend to be the optimistic one and there's lots of good that happened in my life this year.

Firstly, I finished my first year of college, and it feels like I finally discovered a place where I fit in. Stuff I've been bullied for so long, now are considered cool (can you imagine, me cool) and I actually have friends now. Genuine friends!

Not only that but I got good grades and I'm up for a scholarship. With that I could finally get myself a drum kit!

A drum kit as this year I also finished my additional drum classes, and I can say that _I'm licensed in drumming_ :))

On top of that, I was a volunteer at the first reptile expo of my country (that was in Feb) and seeing and interacting with all those cool creatures and fantastic people that loved them wholeheartedly just warmed my heart enough to make a second sun.

My first commissions also took place this year! I'm far from being a pro artist but I felt so proud when the clients loved the work I did for them.

Also, managed to get real fossils for cheap from the paleontological institute, which I tracked the location of with the aid of a new college friend. Picture two young adults in total awe at the geology museum :)

And to top it off, after 4 years of jumping through hoops I managed to finally get myself a bearded dragon, my dream pet. His name is Raysip, he's 2 months old and he just ate from my hand ❤️

On the site I play Yahtzee on, you can play with another person, however there's only preset messages and emojis. Nick and I somehow really communicated through our limited options.

,CasualConversation,"Hello! I'm 17 years old and I have had low self-esteem for a long time. Until 10 the grade, I wasn't conscious of it, but now I see how detrimental is this lack of confidence for my life. 
Do you some advice for me? I would like to add also I am an introvert person with a few acquaintances ( I couldn't call them friends). I have one girl who I consider a closer person to me, only. 

PS: I live in an isolated village from Europe, with no close relatives and after my dad's death I started to isolate myself from the village. I have  horrible neighbours who have attempted to beat my parent( mom).
Also, I have an overprotective mom, who considers studies more important than social life. What's worse, I listened to her up to high school, where I have the opportunity to see a new medium.


 In order to carry on my studies in high school, I study in another city 50 km from home and I stay at a host, who has a big impact on my realisation that I must change.

Now, do you think I could be more confident if I talked to my mom about my problems. I had a discussion with my host about my problem from the past and she spoke to my mom, but... Afterward, I do not have any discussion with my parent. She just said that there is no point in considering myself a mess and that I am a beautiful person....that's all...

,CasualConversation,"I’ve been saving up for a couple months to buy my first car, roughly $750 dollars before I had to stop working to go back to school. I knew it wasn’t enough even though I wanted a cheap car (early 2000’s Honda Civic), although it wasn’t my dream car it would be reliable and last me a long time. But growing up I loved my dad’s Jeep Wrangler, I’m unsure of the exact year but it’s from the 90s. I looked like a monster truck to little me because it was raised up, and I wanted it to be my first car.

Eventually it wasn’t a viable car for my dad to keep around, and sold it. I was sad but I knew it was the best option because it wasn’t getting much use. But today my dad came home from work and started asking about dream cars. Asked what I want my first car to be; Honda Civic. Asked what my dream car is; 1967 Cadillac DeVille. Joked around about the Cadillac for a few minutes before he brought up the Wrangler. I said how I loved that car but he had sold it so I figured it was out of the question.

Turns out the person he sold it to, he was a friend of a friend and never really kept in touch, had gotten in contact with him. He had only drove the Wrangler a handful of times before he let it sit. He wanted to give it back to my dad, for free. It runs fine but needs some repairs, repairs that I have the money for. In a couple days it’ll end up back at my house and I can start fixing back up to how I remember it.

,CasualConversation,"Recently, I learned about the ""Blood Type Personality Theory."" In short, it is a very popular pseudoscientific theory that basically means that your blood type determines your personality. It may seem strange to you if, like me, had never heard of this before. But it's actually not that strange because the Internet loves ""determining"" your personality. So here is a casual read about some of these personality tests, theories, and beliefs.

First off, just look at BuzzFeed. There are so many quizzes that can tell you what Disney Princess you are, or your favorite food will determine what personality you have. There is no science behind any of this, but that's not really necessary because it's just a fun little quiz to entertain you. You can agree or disagree with the result and share it with your friends. And if you get a result you don't like, it doesn't;t matter because you be whatever princess you want to be.

Now moving on to something a little more serious, Hogwarts Houses. Now, if you've never read the books or watched the movies or do anything Harry Potter related, you might not care about your Hogwarts House. But when it comes to those in the HP fanbase, your House is very important to your identity. And because the Houses are not really created equal, so most would want to be a Gryffindor or Ravenclaw, therefore causing some Houses to be ""better"" than others. People who don't really bother with taking the quiz, will probably ask ""Why do you care anyway?"" But to those who find Harry Potter to be something they hold close to their heart, their House is something important to their identity and personality.

If you have never taken a BuzzFeed quiz or the Sorting Hat quiz, all of this may seem like little things that don't have any impact on people's lives. But now consider the following: Astrology. There is your sign, your element, your horoscope, your love compatibility, and Mercury in retrograde. If I were to compare all of this to board games, BuzzFeed quizzes would be checkers, and Astrology would be fucking 4D chess or something.

And astrology is a worldwide thing. For example, [Astrology.com](https://astrology.com/) alone provides ""daily horoscopes, online tarot readings, psychic readings, Chinese *astrology*, Vedic *Astrology*, Mayan *Astrology*, Numerology, etc."" Cultures all over the world seem to think that your personality is determined by fate or the occult, or some divine celestial objects can predict the future.

Now, this isn't to hate on astrology; rather, I was amazed at how many different forms of it all over the place. Also, you might find yourself to believe in some form of astrology or something similar.  
But another question is, what does BuzzFeed and Hogwarts Houses have anything to do with it. The thing is, while they may seem like they have no connection (my checkers to 4D chess comparison) they are actually quite similar when you consider this: They all ""determine"" your personality.

Of course, they all do so in different ways. You can just take a few minutes to answer questions that tell you what personality you have. It's really straightforward because the questions basically ask you what personality you have. On the other hand, other personalities determining methods are predetermined. You are born on a certain month, or a certain year, you have a certain blood type, etc.

Let's use the blood type personality theory as an example since it started this whole post. I'll compare it to Hogwarts Houses to show how they are similar.

The blood types are A, B, O, and AB, and their traits are as follows: As are well-organized, Bs are selfish, Os are optimistic, and ABs are eccentric. Compare this to the four Hogwarts Houses: Gryffindor, Ravenclaw, Slytherin, and Hufflepuff. Gryffindors are brave, Ravenclaws are smart, Slytherins are cunning, and Hufflepuffs are loyal. In the same way each blood-type has certain traits and quirks, so do Hogwarts Houses. 

But there is something they have in common that isn't so pleasant. While Hogwarts Houses is something J.K. Rowling came up with and wrote down on an aeroplane sick bag, it has become and important part of the fanbase. If you claim to be a HP fan but don't know your house, you're probably not a HP fan. 

On the other hand, Masahiko Nomi published papers in the 1970s that revived this theory originally published by Takeji Furukawa. Today, it is extremely popular in places like  Japan, South Korea, and Taiwan. There are magazines, newspapers and television shows that feature horoscopes and relationship compatibilities. It is such an important aspect of the culture. And regardless of whether you believe in it or not, as long as it is talked about, its popularity and impact will increase. 

But while both Hogwarts Houses and Blood Type Theory have some similarities, the thing that really connects the two is how they both have negative types. Sure, whether a specific trait is a good thing or a bad thing is subjective. But the majority of people don't think that. If you're a Slytherin, you're in the same house as Voldemort so you're basically a evil, murderous villain. 

The exact same thing happens with blood types. While blood type B has positive traits, people focus on how the negative traits outweigh the good ones, so people with blood type B are seen as selfish.

What is worse is that while you can lie about what house you got on the quiz, your blood-type is not something you choose. Not only that, not only can it impact a person's social life, it can affect one's career because job recruitment and school entrance exams have asked for people's blood types in applications.

The main takeaway for me from all this is that people care a lot about personality and identity than they would like to admit. It is all trivial things that don't have a scientific basis or anything to back it up, but they become so popular because it's so easy to categorize people that way. And I guess I wasn't satisfied with it. If we categorize people the same way you categorize Pokemon by type, is any person truly unique and special, and do their traits and personality actually matter anymore?

And if people still think the impact of categorizing people with labels isn't that big, just look at the some of the issues that plague humanity. We label people by race, sex, gender, religion, etc. When you take differences between people and decide you know what, this group is better than that other group, there is going to arguments and disagreements about it. It can be a little argument on the Internet but once it happens in the real world via bullying, discrimination, stereotypes, etc., it becomes an issue. And if media portrays differences between people as one is good and one is bad, we don't really take into account a person's actual personality and instead rely on factors that are pre-determined or don't really affect a person's character.

Of course, it's not really fair to compare BuzzFeed quizzes to racism (I won't go to war with you if you are a different Disney Princess) but the point is that we shouldn't take these quizzes or theories too seriously and harass others for being different. We're all different and that's okay. 

All of these quizzes and theories can't really determine exactly what personality you have or predict your future. But it is fine to celebrate our differences. You can say your zodiac sign, Hogwarts House, blood type, etc. with confidence and be proud of your identity. Just remember that we're all humans with unique personalities so a quiz or belief shouldn't determine who you are, *you* determine who you are. 

But that's just what I think. Whether someone agrees or disagrees, it's a chance for me to learn more about all of this stuff.

There is no science behind any of this, but that&amp;#39;s not really necessary because it&amp;#39;s just a fun little quiz to entertain you. You can agree or disagree with the result and share it with your friends. And if you get a result you don&amp;#39;t like, it doesn&amp;#39;t;t matter because you be whatever princess you want to be.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now moving on to something a little more serious, Hogwarts Houses. Now, if you&amp;#39;ve never read the books or watched the movies or do anything Harry Potter related, you might not care about your Hogwarts House. But when it comes to those in the HP fanbase, your House is very important to your identity. And because the Houses are not really created equal, so most would want to be a Gryffindor or Ravenclaw, therefore causing some Houses to be &amp;quot;better&amp;quot; than others. People who don&amp;#39;t really bother with taking the quiz, will probably ask &amp;quot;Why do you care anyway?&amp;quot; But to those who find Harry Potter to be something they hold close to their heart, their House is something important to their identity and personality.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you have never taken a BuzzFeed quiz or the Sorting Hat quiz, all of this may seem like little things that don&amp;#39;t have any impact on people&amp;#39;s lives. But now consider the following: Astrology. There is your sign, your element, your horoscope, your love compatibility, and Mercury in retrograde. If I were to compare all of this to board games, BuzzFeed quizzes would be checkers, and Astrology would be fucking 4D chess or something.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And astrology is a worldwide thing. For example, &lt;a href=""https://astrology.com/""&gt;Astrology.com&lt;/a&gt; alone provides &amp;quot;daily horoscopes, online tarot readings, psychic readings, Chinese &lt;em&gt;astrology&lt;/em&gt;, Vedic &lt;em&gt;Astrology&lt;/em&gt;, Mayan &lt;em&gt;Astrology&lt;/em&gt;, Numerology, etc.&amp;quot; Cultures all over the world seem to think that your personality is determined by fate or the occult, or some divine celestial objects can predict the future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, this isn&amp;#39;t to hate on astrology; rather, I was amazed at how many different forms of it all over the place. Also, you might find yourself to believe in some form of astrology or something similar.&lt;br/&gt;
But another question is, what does BuzzFeed and Hogwarts Houses have anything to do with it. The thing is, while they may seem like they have no connection (my checkers to 4D chess comparison) they are actually quite similar when you consider this: They all &amp;quot;determine&amp;quot; your personality.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, they all do so in different ways. You can just take a few minutes to answer questions that tell you what personality you have. It&amp;#39;s really straightforward because the questions basically ask you what personality you have. On the other hand, other personalities determining methods are predetermined. You are born on a certain month, or a certain year, you have a certain blood type, etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;#39;s use the blood type personality theory as an example since it started this whole post. I&amp;#39;ll compare it to Hogwarts Houses to show how they are similar.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The blood types are A, B, O, and AB, and their traits are as follows: As are well-organized, Bs are selfish, Os are optimistic, and ABs are eccentric. Compare this to the four Hogwarts Houses: Gryffindor, Ravenclaw, Slytherin, and Hufflepuff. Gryffindors are brave, Ravenclaws are smart, Slytherins are cunning, and Hufflepuffs are loyal. In the same way each blood-type has certain traits and quirks, so do Hogwarts Houses. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But there is something they have in common that isn&amp;#39;t so pleasant. While Hogwarts Houses is something J.K. Rowling came up with and wrote down on an aeroplane sick bag, it has become and important part of the fanbase. If you claim to be a HP fan but don&amp;#39;t know your house, you&amp;#39;re probably not a HP fan. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, Masahiko Nomi published papers in the 1970s that revived this theory originally published by Takeji Furukawa. Today, it is extremely popular in places like  Japan, South Korea, and Taiwan. There are magazines, newspapers and television shows that feature horoscopes and relationship compatibilities. It is such an important aspect of the culture. And regardless of whether you believe in it or not, as long as it is talked about, its popularity and impact will increase. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But while both Hogwarts Houses and Blood Type Theory have some similarities, the thing that really connects the two is how they both have negative types. Sure, whether a specific trait is a good thing or a bad thing is subjective. But the majority of people don&amp;#39;t think that. If you&amp;#39;re a Slytherin, you&amp;#39;re in the same house as Voldemort so you&amp;#39;re basically a evil, murderous villain. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The exact same thing happens with blood types. While blood type B has positive traits, people focus on how the negative traits outweigh the good ones, so people with blood type B are seen as selfish.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What is worse is that while you can lie about what house you got on the quiz, your blood-type is not something you choose. Not only that, not only can it impact a person&amp;#39;s social life, it can affect one&amp;#39;s career because job recruitment and school entrance exams have asked for people&amp;#39;s blood types in applications.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The main takeaway for me from all this is that people care a lot about personality and identity than they would like to admit. It is all trivial things that don&amp;#39;t have a scientific basis or anything to back it up, but they become so popular because it&amp;#39;s so easy to categorize people that way. And I guess I wasn&amp;#39;t satisfied with it. If we categorize people the same way you categorize Pokemon by type, is any person truly unique and special, and do their traits and personality actually matter anymore?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And if people still think the impact of categorizing people with labels isn&amp;#39;t that big, just look at the some of the issues that plague humanity. We label people by race, sex, gender, religion, etc. When you take differences between people and decide you know what, this group is better than that other group, there is going to arguments and disagreements about it. It can be a little argument on the Internet but once it happens in the real world via bullying, discrimination, stereotypes, etc., it becomes an issue. And if media portrays differences between people as one is good and one is bad, we don&amp;#39;t really take into account a person&amp;#39;s actual personality and instead rely on factors that are pre-determined or don&amp;#39;t really affect a person&amp;#39;s character.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, it&amp;#39;s not really fair to compare BuzzFeed quizzes to racism (I won&amp;#39;t go to war with you if you are a different Disney Princess) but the point is that we shouldn&amp;#39;t take these quizzes or theories too seriously and harass others for being different. We&amp;#39;re all different and that&amp;#39;s okay. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All of these quizzes and theories can&amp;#39;t really determine exactly what personality you have or predict your future. But it is fine to celebrate our differences. You can say your zodiac sign, Hogwarts House, blood type, etc. with confidence and be proud of your identity. Just remember that we&amp;#39;re all humans with unique personalities so a quiz or belief shouldn&amp;#39;t determine who you are, &lt;em&gt;you&lt;/em&gt; determine who you are. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But that&amp;#39;s just what I think. Whether someone agrees or disagrees, it&amp;#39;s a chance for me to learn more about all of this stuff. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;TFL;DR Personality quizzes and theories don&amp;#39;t really determine a person&amp;#39;s personality because everyone is different and unique.&lt;/p&gt;

,CasualConversation,"Just wondering how you guys vote on Reddit comments.

I imagine a lot of people on Reddit upvote what they agree with but downvote what they disagree with. I do this with posts of course, but with comments I often find I'm downvoting people who are rude, even if I agree with their premise, because they weren't kind/helpful/respectful.

I also upvote things I disagree with if I feel the comment was informative and helped me understand the alternative perspective better in a kind manner.

I'm not sure if this is ""not the purpose of voting"", but I feel like people deserve to be acknowledged for being kind and helpful even if I disagree with them. Even if it is just with fake Internet points 🙂

Occasionally I'll even refrain from voting on a comment if I'm unsure of what tone the writer intended. Just don't feel comfortable doing it! What if they are being a jerk?

,CasualConversation,"I’m lucky to see a family of ducks walking around. In my area its actually more common to see a family of deer. And when I say family, I mean there was a momma turkey leading three or four baby turkeys across the street during rush hour. I saw the person in front of me waving them across during a red light and it just filled me with so much joy; I’d only ever seen a wild turkey maybe one other time. 

A few years ago, I was living in Boston and was woken up at 7 am by an unmistakable—surreal—gobble gobbling. The gentle morning sunrise glistened through my dew ridden window, as I peeled the curtain open and laid eyes on the plumpest Thanksgiving posterfowl, galavanting down a main street sidewalk. Oddly enough, there were a few other people already out at the time and they just kept walking, taking no notice. They had to have heard it, as the only sounds that morning were a gobble, a glub, and the light tick tacking of fragile, bony feet, progressing across city cement. The turkey was just another pedestrian, whistling to itself during its morning commute.

Something about turkeys is almost mythical to me. Seeing wild ones makes me imagine a time when the Northern US was a vastly wooded area without shopping centers or office buildings. We eat turkey so often in unnatural processed ways, its easy to forget how long they’ve been in this country—before even the first American settlers. I wanted to get out of my car today and ask the family questions about the first Thanksgiving; what the great Native American tribes were like before colonization. 

I read that wild turkeys are back on the rise in North America, and I’d really like that. Seeing even one in my suburban area is rare; seeing a mother with her turkey babies, proudly exploring the land of their ancestors, evoked emotions that I’m sure mimicked the sensation of stumbling across several unicorns, communing next to a pot of gold.

,CasualConversation,"Background: I work as a programmer in my father's company. It's a really small company.   
I am safe and confortable here and I also know that my only way to grow up, earn more money, is working harder and seeking more customers for us.

I got an indication to work in a multinacional company. It's really a great opportunity for my carrer, but with great powers....  
More money, more benefits(awesome health plan for example), a well defined path to growth inside the company, but much more work aswell. I am kinda lazy and I like to do things in my own time. For example, today I watched anime half of the day cause I have no close deadline coming and I can always do my job at any time, like If I want to work at midnight I can.

I am safe and confortable here and I also know that my only way to grow up, earn more money, is working harder and seeking more customers for us.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I got an indication to work in a multinacional company. It&amp;#39;s really a great opportunity for my carrer, but with great powers....&lt;br/&gt;
More money, more benefits(awesome health plan for example), a well defined path to growth inside the company, but much more work aswell. I am kinda lazy and I like to do things in my own time.

I know I have to see a dentist, and I want to fix this, but problem is I'm too afraid to do it. And I know the more I wait the worse it is.

I'd look up reviews to choose a place, but that's not a thing here. It's word of mouth that spreads that kind of info around here and I couldn't find any place without horror stories.

Everyone I know or talked to went in and had to go to a second place to fix what the first screw up.

Mom had her front teeth scraped by her dentist so she would go back and fix that, she went to other place. Dad had to get a tooth out, the dentist broke it and left pieces inside that got infected and kept insisting that nothing was wrong, after days of agonizing pain dad managed to find another dentist that would intervine in other one's work and that found and got the pieces out. My grandma had emergency surgery because her dentist didn't sterilize his tools properly, got a very bad infection and now she can't swim. Classmate had to replace three teeth after her dentist drilled in them accidentally.

I myself as a kid almost got all my lower front teeth removed (the permanent ones). And it's all different people I'm talking.

,CasualConversation,"This all happened about a month ago, but it came back to my mind and I wanted to share it.

At the end of July I finished studying, and had to spend two days in a different city (almost 100 km away) for the exams. 

Even though I'm friendly with all of them, I didn't really bond with any of my classmates, so I ended up spending most of those two days alone, but it was a blessing in disguise.


I woke up early in the morning and drove all the way there, looking at a beautiful morning sky and listening to music.

On the first evening I bought myself some cookies I always wanted to try, then spent a couple hours on the swings in a local park; after it closed I walked to a nearby square and found it full of children playing, so I stayed there a little, offering them cookies and retrieving their ball from time to time.

After this, I was already feeling like I finally had a choice in my life. Quarantine really took a toll on me, even though I'm always at home I hated being denied the ability to go out.


On the second day we all finished with our exams and they told us whether we passed or not; we said goodbye to each other, there were hand shakes, high fives, pats on the shoulder and so on.

Everyone got on their car and drove away; I was the last one to leave. I was thinking of how a big chunk of my life had ended right there; I would no longer be studying, I would never see all those people again, and I would be starting to work in a few weeks.

I started driving back home, when on the GPS I noticed I would be passing through the town where a friend of mine lived. I thought about it for a bit, how we see each other rarely because of the distance, then said screw it, pulled over and called my friend; I asked him if he was free for dinner and he said yes.

We spent the evening together, we got pizza, wandered around the town centre, then went back to his house and sit outside under the porch just talking; when I came back home it was 2:30 am and I had never been so happy before.


It really felt like I had my life in my own hands, I could actually do whatever I wanted, I could finally do whatever came to my mind without having to ask permission or fear being mocked about it.

This is something I have always struggled with, I got my driving licence late, didn't have a car of my own and lived in a small town, so I was always somewhat limited in the places I could visit on a whim; these two days were a taste of what my dream life looked like, and from now on I'll work hard to make it real.",t2_4dcmm1ck,False,,0,False,I felt free for the first time in years,"[{'a': ':story:', 'e': 'emoji', 'u': 'https://emoji.redditmedia.com/pmjxkvo9ukg21_t5_323oy/story'}, {'e': 'text', 't': ' Life Stories'}]",r/CasualConversation,,False,6,,0,,False,t3_il3baj,False,light,0.97,,public,27,0,{},,False,[],,False,False,,{},:story: Life Stories,False,27,,False,,False,,[],{},,True,,1599065933.0,richtext,6,,,text,self.CasualConversation,False,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;This all happened about a month ago, but it came back to my mind and I wanted to share it.&lt;/p&gt;

,CasualConversation,"Have you ever ""lost"" a wallet, but you feel like it's not really lost, it's just somewhere where you can't find it. I can trace my steps back. And I think it is probably somewhere in my car or in my house... yet I can't find it. 

I went through a drive through on Monday, then went home, then to a park at night. But when I go to the park I usually do not take my wallet with me (leave it home or in car). But my car was locked so I doubt it was stolen. Next day I was home all day with my kid. And then around 5pm I simply could not find it. 

Maybe it fell out of my car while I was exiting? 

Maybe my kid hit it somewhere (I asked and he denied); he's 6 and he has done this before.

Maybe it's just in some obvious spot and I am completely overlooking it. 

Maybe it fell into the trash or a clothes hamper?

,CasualConversation,"I (29,M) think I took a longer than normal amount of time to learn how to function with other kids effectively. As an elementary student or younger, the way I perceived my relationships with other kids was either that they didn’t want to play with me, or that they just wanted to make fun of me or pick on me. I felt like my entire class of students would bully me, often very much a 20 vs 1 situation it felt like.. (for being fat, bad at sports, ugly.. those were the main themes).. and over time as we went through 5th grade, onto middle and high school, these treatments faded and I developed some good friendships. Life was pretty normal from then on, even having a normal dating life, slimming down, and becoming a college athlete. Since college ended I’ve had a lot of professional success too, having moved from my home town to NYC where I’m living a good life, and I’m aware I have a lot to be grateful for. Still though, I feel like two aspects of who I am as a person remain from being “bullied” as a kid: 

1. I’m very shy around people I don’t know, even avoiding eye contact and I have trouble making conversations.

(And here is the reason for my post)
2. Decades later, I feel a residual amount of pleasure when someone I don’t generally care for is in emotional distress. 

Today I saw a video of a pregnant Australian woman being arrested for trying to organize a demonstration despite currently in-force laws against congregating. You may have seen the video, it’s making the rounds. She is arrested in front of her two kids, is currently pregnant and is going to miss an ultrasound appointment by being arrested, and all of the home electronics were seized by a search warrant. She has a breakdown, and is completely desperate not to be arrested. My reaction was.. satisfaction. I was a little happy to see her so miserable in such a complicated situation. 

So I questioned myself, realizing that I feel this satisfaction somewhat often when I see someone I don’t care for (be they annoying, or maybe I find their views problematic.. whatever the reason) in a distressing situation. I don’t want to be someone who feels joy at another person’s distress. Does anyone think that my innate joy in these moments is related to seeing people feel as badly as I used to feel as a bullied child? That was my only hypothesis to why I have this tendency at all.

,CasualConversation,"I’m having a bit of FOMO or grass is greener on the other side mentality

&amp;#x200B;

I am 29 years old and make around $65k as a project manager at a software company. I’m good with my salary and it affords me the lifestyle I want. I’m able and have been able to reach savings goals for milestone items like house, car, vacations, etc. 

&amp;#x200B;

I have friends who are my age who, when we talk about salary, I feel that they are deceitfully one-upping me. Often times I don’t disclose what I make because I hate getting into piss contests over it. Nurses, PCAs, social workers, a lot of jobs that traditionally don’t make more than $65k are telling me they make significantly more than that, when they've only been in the job 3-5 years. Some throw in that they put in overtime or other bonuses. But still, you can research on indeed and Glassdoor and find the average salary and it’s never what they’re saying. So I’m often skeptical. We live in a far out suburb of MN where the cost of living is decently low. 

&amp;#x200B;

Then to top it off my brother and sister who are both sales reps at different software companies tell me that they make $150k a year and they’re both a few years younger than me, decently new in their roles. They make it sound like they struck gold mines and barely have to work. This is where I’m starting to get frustrated. Either everyone is somehow making a shit ton more than they deserve, or everyone is lying to me. 

&amp;#x200B;

I’ve researched Glassdoor and the average sales rep salaries for their companies are about half of what they’re saying with commission. Are they trying to tell me that they’re that much above average? 

&amp;#x200B;

So my ask is; do people lie about their salaries this often? It’s what I’ve been telling myself, but I also don’t want to kid myself. I simply just value truth and above any feelings, I just don't want people close to me lying to me. I want to simply be happy for them while simultaneously letting it motivate me. But I just can’t shake the idea that many are lying. ",t2_likrn,False,,0,False,How often do friends lie about their salaries?,"[{'a': ':chat:', 'e': 'emoji', 'u': 'https://emoji.redditmedia.com/04fpiw4fukg21_t5_323oy/chat'}, {'e': 'text', 't': ' Just Chatting'}]",r/CasualConversation,,False,6,,0,,False,t3_ilddcn,False,light,0.71,,public,3,0,{},,False,[],,False,False,,{},:chat: Just Chatting,False,3,,False,,False,,[],{},,True,,1599102880.0,richtext,6,,,text,self.CasualConversation,True,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;I’m having a bit of FOMO or grass is greener on the other side mentality&lt;/p&gt;

This happened when I was a teenager in the pre-internet days of the early 1990s. It wasn't as easy to learn how to do simple fixes or house repairs as it is today. There were no YouTube video tutorials. If your furnace was acting up, you payed someone to come look at it, or you first asked a friend or neighbor who might know how to fix it. One day my mom saw our neighbor outside and mentioned some issue we were having with the furnace. He offered to take a look.

My neighbor was an old man with a lot of wild opinions, which were easier to ignore back then. The three of us went into the basement, and hovered around the furnace. My mother flipped the main breaker before he started poking around.

The night before, someone must have paused the CD player instead of turning it off, because when we flipped the breaker back on, we heard a woman's voice loud and clear, announce:

,CasualConversation,"Hi there, 

important things first: nothing at all happened. It's just the thought of ""it could have happened"" that's driving me insane.

So I was mowing the lawn and my dog just likes to hang around and watch me or enjoy the sun while I do so.

I always thoroughly check the lawn for sticks and leftover bones first - dog owners will know ^^

but today I missed a small piece of bone that she must have left, very well hidden on the lawn, yesterday.

as I mowed over it, it shot out from underneath the mower and missed her head by no more than just a couple of inches before it literally bounced of a wall and almost hit her from behind as well.

I immediately checked she didn't get hit by it.
she's fine. it missed her. she was actually quite excited (after the inicial shock), started looking all over for that piece of bone and was proud and happy as, when she found it.

but all that was and is on my mind is: what if it would have hit her? that thing was like a bullet. I would have never been able to forgive myself.

anyway, she might have to stay inside from now on whenever I mow the lawn. It's probably safer in general.

&lt;p&gt;important things first: nothing at all happened. It&amp;#39;s just the thought of &amp;quot;it could have happened&amp;quot; that&amp;#39;s driving me insane.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So I was mowing the lawn and my dog just likes to hang around and watch me or enjoy the sun while I do so.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I always thoroughly check the lawn for sticks and leftover bones first - dog owners will know &lt;sup&gt;^&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;but today I missed a small piece of bone that she must have left, very well hidden on the lawn, yesterday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;as I mowed over it, it shot out from underneath the mower and missed her head by no more than just a couple of inches before it literally bounced of a wall and almost hit her from behind as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I immediately checked she didn&amp;#39;t get hit by it.
she&amp;#39;s fine. it missed her. she was actually quite excited (after the inicial shock), started looking all over for that piece of bone and was proud and happy as, when she found it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;but all that was and is on my mind is: what if it would have hit her? that thing was like a bullet. I would have never been able to forgive myself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In my mind it actually replays as if it was hitting her. It is as if my brain just won&amp;#39;t ever even believe how lucky we just were.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;anyway, she might have to stay inside from now on whenever I mow the lawn. It&amp;#39;s probably safer in general.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Does anyone else get lost in those &amp;quot;what if the worst would have happened...&amp;quot; thoughts instead of just appreciating that nothing bad happened and move on?&lt;/p&gt;

I get talking to the guy in the comments, and he asks me to join the project. At first I say no.

Took a year for me to get out of it. And I ofcourse imagined this show was going to be light hearted and fun, talking about awkward romance, but giving hopes for the future.

I know how easily now I can be controlled, and so I have very high expectations of my next partner, they need to be very special - or else I rather not have anyone at all. And so, I said no to take part in this show.

,CasualConversation,"I don't think anyone will actually see this, but today, I just had my first orientation session for welcome week for my first year in university! Two years ago, I kind of lost all hope that I would make it into my dream program / university due to a brain injury from a car accident which caused all sorts of problems for me academically. I had a lot of trouble with memory and word finding and  also developed some speech problems. I suffered from a lot anxiety and panic attacks and depressive episodes. I pushed all of my friends away and preferred to be alone and was just in a really dark place overall. It didn't help that one of my teachers believed I was faking my symptoms and told me to just ""get over it"". The required minimum average to be considered for my program was a 92%. Before the accident, I was at high 80s. After the accident, I dropped to high 60s/low 70s. I just gave up at that point.

Two years ago, I kind of lost all hope that I would make it into my dream program / university due to a brain injury from a car accident which caused all sorts of problems for me academically. I had a lot of trouble with memory and word finding and  also developed some speech problems. I suffered from a lot anxiety and panic attacks and depressive episodes. I pushed all of my friends away and preferred to be alone and was just in a really dark place overall. It didn&amp;#39;t help that one of my teachers believed I was faking my symptoms and told me to just &amp;quot;get over it&amp;quot;. The required minimum average to be considered for my program was a 92%. Before the accident, I was at high 80s. After the accident, I dropped to high 60s/low 70s. I just gave up at that point.&lt;/p&gt;

Hey, new to this sub and hope this type of post is permitted. I (22/f) live in Nova Scotia, Canada, and due to places being open again went to take my beginners drivers test.

My regular eye doctor has a very long waiting list, so I scheduled an appointment for a different doctor, expecting to get ok results. The doctor was SO nice about listening to me talk about my rare facial paralysis (Moebius syndrome), and did all the nessasary tests.

He was in contact with my previous doctor's office to see their findings, and they were consistant. He was apologetic and said that because my eyes are shaped like lemons instead of oranges (stigmatisim I think) and that they are around a 6 (abnormally high) that the only thing he could think about doing was hard contacts, but that even then it was a long shot.

My mom and I were at Costco today. She sometimes needs one of those “drive-able” shopping carts if her feet hurt from being swollen.

,CasualConversation,"Two days ago I ordered from a restaurant I ordered from twice before, they have a nice chicken and beef shawarma dish with rice and sauce on the side.

The dish is two servings, so it was great value. However, the rice was only enough for half the dish so this time I asked in the notes to add some extra rice and that I'll pay in person (site takes credit cards, and extra rice wasn't on the menu)

When the delivery person arrived he asked how I'm doing and told me the owner says the rice is complimentary. He said the owner knows me for the reviews I write on the website. I only wrote two, but it was cool that he actually acknowledged them and mentioned that he appreciates them to me!

The second instance was earlier today. A friend of mine and I grabbed a breakfast plate from a restaurant he knows. We got to chat with the owner and we talked about all kinds of stuff like his other businesses, how covid affected things, etc. We talked for at least 40 minutes. When we went to pay the lady refused to take our credit card, saying the owner says it's on him this time. My friend goes there a lot, and today they wouldn't let him pay a cent. Saying they also made his meal extra special because he called in to check if they're open earlier.

I noticed that covid is making everyone appreciate a conversation. Every time I go to the grocery store now, at least one or two employees and I talk for a few minutes while I do my shopping. Usually I'm not talkative but it's weird how I feel close to everyone now that we're going through similar hardships.

,CasualConversation,"I originally had plans to stay in the city I went to college after I graduated. Had a couple of job offers lined up, but as most things in my life happen, they ended up falling through and not working out, forcing me to go back home instead. 

Not too long after graduating, maybe 3 months total, I landed a job 8 miles away from my house. Borderline dream job. Basically work for a mini Google. Insane salary for my position, with all kinds of crazy perks and benefits. I still have to pinch myself sometimes that this is my job, and I've been with them now for a year and a half. 

As most companies have had to do with COVID, we are all working from home right now. Last week, our leadership team came to the conclusion that not only has productivity not declined, but it has actually gotten better for us since we've been working from home. All of our work is done through computers and over the phone, and we really could work wherever we have a stable internet connection. So, knowing that, they made an announcement that we were now allowed to work from home permanently. Not only that, we can even work remote should we decide that we want to move, even if out of state. 

I literally feel like they handed me my official golden ticket. Over 20 years of always catching the short end of the stick. And even when something good happens, it's almost always followed up by crap, and I've never had a string of good happen like this before. 

Being home hasn't been the worst thing in the world. My expenses are minimal, and I've been able to save quite easily, even buying a brand new car and getting it paid off in 10 months. But I was so bummed out about moving out because I knew I'd have to give this job up to do it. Well not anymore, and I couldn't be more excited. I'm not taking off right away, and I want to make sure I've got a great cushion financially before I do, but knowing that it's basically wherever I want to go, and whenever I want to is this crazy feeling of control in my life I've never felt before.

He’s like 60 I’m guessing, I’m 22 and his youngest patient since he works in a place that does not accept insurance except for Medicare, so he def is used to working with mainly older people. I’m only here bc I was referred to him when I moved. 

Out of the 7 months that I’ve been with him, I’ve literally been at his office like every week for the past month and a half for emergency visits and follow ups bc it’s been just non-stop eye issues with a chronic eye disease that I have, so he’s definitely gotten to know me more. He has complimented me multiple times of  how ‘bright of a young lady’ I am, and entered the room a couple of weeks ago with “hows my favorite patient doing today?” Lmao. Am also a new grad nursing student and he loves being able to think critically with me on things that he wouldn’t be able to do with his other patients. 

He’s extremely professional, super chill and sweet, and I don’t think he’s being flirtatious or anything like that at all, but I was wondering why he’s been winking at me on the way out before going to the next patient’s room.

,CasualConversation,"A couple of years or so ago, my mom gave me her old desktop because she never used it.  It had some pretty decent components, near-gaming quality at the time she installed them.  Alas, like all good things, some of the parts must eventually come to an end.


The graphics card had apparently been giving me some problems.  I updated the drivers a couple of weeks ago, and that's when the trouble really started.  Kept getting BSODs left and right, especially while watching YouTube videos or even just browsing the web.


Bought a new graphics card that came today.  It's a MSI GEFORCE GT 710.  I know it's not the latest and greatest in the world, but I don't play any really heavy-duty, graphics-laden games like some of the MMOs or other games.  I only play pretty casual games; the most graphics-laden might be some of the more realistic walking sims/adventure games like *Quern: Undying Thoughts, Obduction,* or *Dear Esther: Landmark Edition*.  The only fast-paced game I play is *Pinball FX3*.


Wrestled with the old card, popped the new one in, went in ""slicker than owl shit"" (as my mom would put it), and so far it seems to be running fine *knocks on wood*.


The old card was apparently dying for at least a year.  Everytime I'd boot up the box, it'd sound like a [Cessna engine](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VFCRXv6nYNI) with rusty parts.  I'd have to hit it in a ""sweet spot"" (yay percussive maintenance) to get it to quiet down.  Now she's quieter than a church mouse during a funeral.


I just know that I'll have to replace some of the other parts.  I plan to run a scan to make sure there's no malwares or other things that might cause further BSODs.

Obviously we’re not having a reunion given the circumstances surrounding covid-19 and I’m glad we’re not because I don’t think I’d be necessarily proud of who I am in the moment.

Maybe in 2-5 more years I’d be happier to present myself to society again.

I was one of those go-to-college kids. I was dead set on “the path”. I was gonna have the dream 9-5 job. The nice car. The nice house. The perfect family.

Such a sheep. I know. And ever since, those 18 year old expectations have imploded in my face leading me to search out a new path for myself in life. Let’s just say 18 year old me would never believe it.

I moved far away from my home town for several years, started my own business, have the pleasure from working at home, am way more overweight that I want to be, might be getting married soon, and have money in the bank I never thought I would.

Some of it is good. Some of it is not as good as I would hope. But I see now that I want to improve. I want to get better. And I want to become someone my 18 year old self would be extremely proud of.

I’m almost there. Just have to keep working hard.

I guess let this be a bit of insight to some of you younger ones in high school right now. Life is unpredictable. You truly never know where you’ll end up. Enjoy the ride and pursue your dreams.

Also take care of your body. It’s the only you’ll ever have. Sleep well. Consume good things. Move your body. Here’s to 2020 come what may.

,CasualConversation," 

I suffered from sleep paralysis my entire life. I'd wake up and be completely paralyzed, thinking I'm yelling out for my brother or mom when I'm just making very faint whimpering noises. It feels like my mouth is sewn shut and I physically can't form words, while my body is being weighed down by an invisible force. **(I never see any paralysis demon or anything, I've had no auditory or visual hallucinations since I was a very young child)**

Since moving out of my parents' house 3 years ago, I started having it on and off but now that I sleep next to my girlfriend, she can wake me up to calm me down. I've started recognizing the feelings that happen just before and can prevent it altogether, but sometimes I just ride the high.

I recently started taking a new medication which is giving me terrible insomnia, so most nights I sleep 2-3 hours then lay awake all night. So last night, I woke up around 3:45 AM and could not for the life of me go back to sleep. As soon as I finally started drifting, I got the paralysis feeling and was like ""fuck it, why not?"" and just rode the wave. Immediately after it stopped, I let it happen again 5 to 6 more times before I had a sharp pain in my lower abdomen.

I was diagnosed with a hernia that happened to sneak up on me at some point a few weeks ago, and spending a stupid amount of time hyperventilating last night caused the hernia to ache incredibly. Imagine getting flicked by Dwayne The Rock Johnson in just **one nut,** that's what it feels like.

Luckily I didn't wake up my girlfriend but at least until I get this hernia fixed, I'm gonna stop abusing the paralysis.

Does anyone else here suffer from sleep paralysis? If so, how do you manage it or break out of it?

,CasualConversation,"I'm going to school tomorrow, in 12th grade. It feels a little bit weird. I don't live in the US, masks are mandatory here but not really social distancing. We have already been warned that there will be cases in schools, and that if there's a case in a school everyone will be tested under 48 hours. But I don't believe that. I haven't been in school since March so I think it will be a little bit difficult to keep the rythm of school. My parents are teachers and I have a brother (we all live together), so I've accepted the fact that there's a high probability that I'm gonna catch it. I will try to be as careful as possible, that's all I can do.

On the other hand, I'm exited to see my friends and learn new things

In conclusion, I have kind of mixed feelings. Excited and resigned at the same time.

So, for fellow students who start school this week and for those who are already back in school : in which grade are you ? How do you feel about this return to school ? Do you feel secure ? What are the measures in place at your school ? How is your class ? Do you have friends with you ?

For parents : how do you feel ? Are you sending your child(ren) back to school (and why) ? Do you think the measures taken are enough ? How is it going so far (if your child(ren) is/are already back to school) ?

Before this summer, video games were my escape. I’d play most days after school and sports to relax. I haven’t touched video games in 5 months. 

It’s very cliché but when we’re together the rest of the world stops. This summer has been one for the record books. We went on countless trips together.. camping, movie nights, weekend vacations, everything. It was also an absolute bender! I’ve never had more fun in my life. I’ve never been this happy. 

When we graduate next year, I’m scared that the adventures will stop. No one is planning on moving away, but people will be getting jobs and will start to move on with their lives.

,CasualConversation,"Edit: The single musical number is [""It's Tough to be a God.""](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igxDzfJ2MPo) It's around the middle of the movie. At no other point in the movie does an on-screen character sing. 

Like, if you're just going to put one in there, then it's not a musical. There are some other songs in the movie, but none that are actually performed by characters. It's just such a bizarre narritive choice to have the movie be so completely not a musical, but then stick a single musical number into the middle of it. I would love to have been in the final script meeting where that got decided, or in the editing room when some producer said ""Take out all the rest of the songs, except that one. I like that one."" 

And it's not like in some other movies where they insert a single musical number as a storytelling device for how over the top a character is feeling, like in 500 Days of Summer for example. And The Road to El Dorado CERTAINLY isn't a Bollywood movie, where inserting a single musical number in an otherwise un-musical movie is a common occurrence.

,CasualConversation,"I was visiting Madison, SD this weekend to visit a friend,  and ended up at one of the many local bars on Saturday night. Got into a conversation with a couple guys there,  just talking about life and the usual things. But the more beer we drank,  the more honest and real the conversation became. 

I'm going through some things in my personal life, and feel like people are always telling me what I want to hear,  not the hard truth. Having this conversation the other day was SO refreshing,  because it was so honest! When you're chatting with people you don't know,  and probably will never see again,  the truth comes out!

So today was my last exam (we have a second chance for exams and it starts around the middle of august until the beginning of september) and it was via videocall.

So I ended up failing that exam and at the end the teacher said that I wasn't made for university, and then that I was probably *""the kind of student who believed they just have to read the course once and then it's done because my course is not as important as maths or chemistry""*.

,CasualConversation,"My friend and I have a tradition we started 3 years ago where each of us had one cigar for the year. Neither of us are frequent smokers, and I personally don't smoke tobacco at all, so when I say I only have one cigar a year, it's literally one cigar a year. It's meant to be a celebratory get together where we go to a cigar lounge and drink scotch and soda. We meet a lot of other interesting people too, but last night was a night I'll never forget.

My biggest problem with smoking cigars is pacing myself. I get the idea that smoking will keep the cigar lit, and it will go out easily. This was my likely mistake, but what follows after I finish happens slowly. First I become nauseous. It's not unusual for me to get uneasy after smoking in a lounge, but this time the sensation only kept getting worse. No sugary soda or amount of fresh air would get me to sober up.

 Next thing I knew, I felt a knot starting to form up in my gut. The best way to describe it was a constant sharp pain that was only made worse from me moving my diaphragm. Luckily, at this point we were on our way back to my friend's apartment (he's driving), but with sudden movement, breaks, accelerating, turns, and bumps, I felt my entire body reeling in pain. Add on top of that being drenched with sweat and being completely numb in my hands and fore arms. I was in rough shape and I'm a lot of pain, but we made it back.

It took every ounce of strength for me just to sit myself up and just turn to be facing outside of the car when he parked. He urged me to stay right where I was, and as soon as he was gone my instinct told me that whatever was in my gut needed to come out.  It was a good thing I had regurgitated one we had parked so the contents of my stomach were on the pavement and not in/on his car. That surprisingly did the trick as I started to quickly recover from my spouts of pain, although still a bit nauseous and a bit dehydrated now.

The rest of the night was uneventful, thankfully. A few Tylenol, some seltzer water, and a few hours of sleep later I was fully recovered. Looking into what had happened exactly, my main hypothesis is that I may have accidentally ingested some of the tobacco leaves from my own cigar. Otherwise, it's possible that it was from smoking the cigar too quickly. Either way, I'll still plan on another cigar next year and take with me what I learned from last night's episode.",t2_4o038ap8,False,,0,False,"Last night, I was going through a case of nicotine poisoning.","[{'a': ':chat:', 'e': 'emoji', 'u': 'https://emoji.redditmedia.com/04fpiw4fukg21_t5_323oy/chat'}, {'e': 'text', 't': ' Just Chatting'}]",r/CasualConversation,,False,6,,0,,False,t3_ikjdob,False,light,0.8,,public,6,0,{},,False,[],,False,False,,{},:chat: Just Chatting,False,6,,False,,False,,[],{},,True,,1598992296.0,richtext,6,,,text,self.CasualConversation,False,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;My friend and I have a tradition we started 3 years ago where each of us had one cigar for the year.

,CasualConversation,"I'm 28. I haven't lived a ton of life, but I've had some really good friends along the way, and unfortunately I've lost touch with a lot of them. 

I'm married with an SO I love very much, and I'm not looking to spark anything from my past, but there are just times where I am overcome with this need to find out what is happening in the lives of the people I've left behind. These can be acquaintances, friends, exes, anybody. I just often think about where people are. 

I think the biggest thing is that I want people to be successful, even if our relationship (however long or short or platonic it was) wasn't successful. I don't know. I spent a lot of time scrolling through Twitter and Instagram this evening trying to find an old high school friend. Him and I were close, at least I thought we were, but I think he removed himself from all social media. The one account I could find is inactive with no posts on it. I'd love to reconnect, even if just for a day to catch up on where life has taken us. 

I don't like getting older. I dont feel older, just the same old stupid 17 y/o stuck in an almost 30 y/o body. Maybe one day I'll reconnect with some of those lost friends, until then I just continue to be nostalgic about the great things they helped me to accomplish and the encouragement they provided as I went through different chapters of my life. They will always hold a special place in my heart, every single person I've ever met.

,CasualConversation,"Hello there, I've just wanted to share what has been making me so happy for the last 1 &amp; 1/2 months

To start of i wanna say, first time poster, English is my second language and no covid-19 regulations were violated during this (maybe longer?) adventure.
(Just realized it is a long story..)

To start of the story, my bf and I were abroad like 3 or something months ago with my PIL, and stayed at a friend of theirs. It was more on the rural side of the country, and we strolled along the neighborhood to have a look at the houses and gardens. We found a close neighbor that had like 10 or something cats in her garden, and they didn't look like they were cared for properly (cats have a different value there than they do in our home country). Anyways, we noticed too very white, blue eyed kittens and fell in love with them immediately! We stopped by every day to watch them play through the fence. After four days we talked about adopting them and asked our friend to come over with us and translate, to ask whether she would be willing to give them away. Owner was fine with that, and we decided to come back later because they were still to young to get away from their mother. 

Moving forward three weeks, we come back, for the owner to tell us, that she would only give away one kitten, because her daughter wanted to keep the other one. Fine with us! Next day arrives, and we're going over to pick up ours. When we saw them, it was... well.. a little shock. Like 5 of the cats there had a really bad eye infection, including our little one, and the other kitten hasn't seemed to grow AT ALL in these 3 weeks. They looked malnourished, and actually like they've been abandoned. We picked up Odin (already had decided on that name) and drove to the vet. The vet was rather concerned about him, because everything he blinked, alot of pus (?) came out of his eyes, but she said as soon as we're conducting a vet at home, it should be fine. 

When we got back, we talked to the owner again, to tell her what the vet told us (that they should get checked as soon as possible) but she kinda just shrugged and only told us, to take care of his ears, as there is barley any fur and they could get sunburnt easily. We take that advice, but since we're only keeping him inside, we didn't think too much about it.

So the day of leaving we come back to her one more time, to thank her, and see that one of her grown cats (also purely white) has a SEVERE sunburn on his ears. I'm talking black crumbs, probably falling off soon, and really in no good condition. She doesn't care. We pack our stuff and our little Odin and off we go home. 

During the car ride he was really well behaved, only cried when he wanted water (which he got). 

When we got home he was too tired to inspect everything and just layed down with us on the couch. We got home on Friday evening, so we had to wait till Monday to get him to a vet. That weekend was horrifying! He just laid with us the whole time, didn't eat, barley drank. We were really scared that he wouldn't make it

BUT Odin is a fighter! We took him to the vet (she also was concerned) and she gave us everything we need. 

Its been about 6 weeks now that he is with us, and he is growing so much and is very active! He shows us love, I never thought would be possible to get from a pet! His eyes are still a little infected, and the vet said (after many more appointments) that maybe it will never be gone completely because it was so bad when he was young. We're still treating him, and it got way better, so as soon as he doesn't seem to be sick, we're happy. 

Two weeks after we got him, we also got him a little black kitten friend (Freya) because we're not home all day, and after just two days they began to eat out of the same bowl. So, that worked out waaaay better than expected! 

Sorry that this got so long, but I just looked at pictures from six weeks ago (skinny, malnourished little kitten) and today (well fed, active teenager-cat) and I feel so much happiness for that little guy, and that he feels so comfortable in his new home with us and his sister, my heart could explode! I'm really glad we got to keep him with us and that he fought through everything. There's still a journey ahead of us, but I think he will manage. Sometimes I think about the other cats, and the other kitten, and whether he made it, but for now I'm glad, that we were able to give Odin a loving home!",t2_64qth7jq,False,,0,False,Precious little kitten brightens up our life,"[{'a': ':paw:', 'e': 'emoji', 'u': 'https://emoji.redditmedia.com/oygs1uttca801_t5_323oy/paw'}, {'e': 'text', 't': ' Pets &amp; Animals'}]",r/CasualConversation,,False,6,,0,,False,t3_ikgw6k,False,light,1.0,,public,7,0,{},,False,[],,False,False,,{},:paw: Pets &amp; Animals,False,7,,False,,False,,[],{},,True,,1598979740.0,richtext,6,,,text,self.CasualConversation,False,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hello there, I&amp;#39;ve just wanted to share what has been making me so happy for the last 1 &amp;amp; 1/2 months&lt;/p&gt;

,CasualConversation,"Our caterers bailed at literally the last minute (yes, I am getting a refund). They're a local couple who started a catering business a few years ago and I think, basically, their marriage imploded that morning and he phoned my (now) husband in tears telling him they weren't coming at about quarter to two. The ceremony began at three. 

My first impressions of them were that they were a bit useless but honest and we'd been to an event they catered so I knew they were good cooks and they had good reviews... they *were* completely useless but they were honest about it, so I got that part right anyway. I do feel sorry for them - I really think that their marriage fell apart and he was in tears when he phoned. They've agreed to refund the money but asked for a bit of time as things are tight at the moment and I'll keep an eye on my account but that's a thought process for another day. 

So, we had to arrange food with literally no notice by ringing friends and asking them to run round the supermarket on the way there (remember, the ceremony was in an hour) and just bring what they could carry and they did an outstanding job. They grabbed literally anything they could that was ready to serve.

Telling my mother was honestly the most stressful part because she looked like she was about to explode but I did not have the mental space to deal with that so I just said very loudly that *it's fine now and it's sorted and we're not getting stressed* to which she replied ""no, we're not going to get stressed"". 

She was a caterer for years (but retired from it) and I helped her out a lot, so we basically managed the logistics of it all and formulated the quickest plan in the history of really quick plans... and it was fine. Between her, my friends who ran into the nearest supermarket and picked up as much as they could carry and my other friend who immediately took charge of serving the drinks... it all worked. 

We, miraculously, had bought some paper plates, paper napkins and recyclable plastic forks for the cake and the venue manager (who was doing it on her own!) was literally going through the cupboards for anything she could lend us. She was amazed at how we weren't having a nervous breakdown about it.

At least it was only 30 people, I guess. Plague restrictions meant the numbers had to be low, which was actually okay because we were no longer obliged to invite certain people so it was very much a Greatest Hits of our friends and family. 

We have already had to reorganise the wedding to varying extents *four times*, so getting here has been a bit of a journey, but I am now married and everyone had a good time and it was all okay in the end. 

A slow stream of photos is arriving via whatsapp, email and bookface messenger. Need to go to the bottle bank tomorrow. 

So, if you're planning a wedding and stressing out over chair covers and seating plans and what to feed your guests - don't worry about it. It'll be fine. At least your caterers will turn up. 

And if they don't... at least you'll get a story out of it.

Edit: My brother found this post so I want to also add that he did a really nice job with the flowers and I'm really grateful for his help.

Damned right am I feeding this lady. She may have come over feeling awkward for asking, but if she thinks she'd  be leaving without a full plate and a tupperware container of my beef shin ragu she's got no idea how wrong she is.

I felt so proud and accomplished making something that someone had smelled and though ""Well I need me some of that"".

I told her that if there is anything that ever smells nice coming from my apartment, there is a plate for her no questions asked.

Cooking/baking has been my lockdown project, and that poor woman has no idea how much food is coming her way.

EDIT: Wow holy shit, I expected 3 messages asking what I was cooking not 500. Thanks for the awards and all.

A weird amount of messages asking why I'm lying for karma. My account is 3 years old and this is my first post, if If I liked lying for karma I'm pretty bad at it. Slow cook a ragu and trust me your place will smell like it for days, I don't know if its balls or desperation but think if I were pregnant and not just fat I'd feel pretty okay asking neighbours I've met before for whatever specific thing they were cooking.

For the redditors saying I should continue offering food once the baby is here, that sounds like a great idea, I think I'll slip a note on her door saying I'll make some extra portions for whenever she wants them.

Also, **RECIPE**:

Take your beef shin, (crust it) roll it around in course sea salt, cracked black pepper, and dried rosemary, let it sit in the crust for overnight in the fridge. Then take it out and sear it in butter until its browned on the outside and let rest for 30 mins, smother it in olive oil, and lightly cover in foil so steam can escape and roast at 180c for 2.5 hours.

Once it is done let it rest for 1 hour and get started on the sauce: Roast 3-4 vines of picollo tomatoes in salt and olive oil for 40mins. whilst that is cooking finely dice 1 large onion, 1 large carrot, and 2-3 sticks of celery.

Saute the carrot first, cover the pan so you sweat it then add the onion until it all looks soft, then add the celery and 5 crushed cloves of garlic and fry for about another 4 minutes until it all looks soft, then when the pan is still very hot throw in a glass of red wine to deglaze the pan. wait 1.5 mins for the alcohol to evaporate and add 500ml of rich beef stock mixed in with fresh rosemary.

Let it all bubble for a bit on mid heat then throw in your roasted tomatoes and break them up a bit with a wooden spoon, add FRESH basil and some dried oregano, if you can some fresh parsley too, a couple bayleaves and good splash or two of Worcestershire sauce. 

Move onto your beef and use two forks to shred the meat, dont cut it, shred it. then add it to your bubbling sauce.

I like to leave it on a very low simmer for about 2-3 hours until most of the water has been reduced off and you're left with a very thick and rich ragu that is worth the effort put into it.

For the pasta I suggest a fresh tagliatelle or pappardelle because the sauce is very rich and doesn't need pastas that will cling onto the sauce.

This recipe is for about 4-5 servings because its so easy to freeze and fuck going through this much effort every time you want a ragu for one.",t2_16s1m9,False,,3,False,My (very) pregnant neighbour asked if she could have some of whatever I am cooking.,[],r/CasualConversation,,False,6,,0,,False,t3_ij1pzu,False,dark,0.87,,public,22281,77,{},,False,[],,False,False,,{},,False,22281,,True,,1598827199.0,,[],"{'gid_1': 1, 'gid_2': 3, 'gid_3': 1}",,True,,1598769382.0,text,6,,,text,self.CasualConversation,True,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;My super pregnant neighbour knocked on my door and said (paraphrasing) &amp;quot;can I have a bowl of whatever you&amp;#39;re cooking, it smells nice and my pregnancy cravings are going crazy&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

I separated from ex-wife last year and divorced earlier this one. We were together 10 years. It was one of the hardest points of my life.

I struggled a lot with feeling I was unlovable or broken or a bad partner. I’ve spent a ton of time working with my therapist to grow and deal with these feelings. Today, I’m a generally pretty happy and confident person.

But I still struggle a bit with physical contact. I can have a great date, but as soon it is nearing the end I stutter and stumble over my words. 

I’ve been talking to this one girl for three months. It’s been moving really slowly because of COVID. We are both careful. Today was our third date. It went really well. At the end, I was awkward as expected and she still wanted to kiss me. It was great. First time I’ve kissed someone in a year. And she’s a great person.

,CasualConversation,"My family has owned a fine dining italian restaurant since before i was born. Most all of my childhood memories are in that restaurant. Everyday after school i’d go do my homework at the bar, i’d follow my dad around the kitchen and help with little things like making salads, and i will never forget making my first pizza at 4 years old. Whenever it stormed really bad and we lost power my family would go and sleep on the floor in the dining room — it was always a safe space. It was always somewhere for us to go, something for us to do, something that needed constant watering and attention. It’s been my family’s livelihood for my entire existence. It’s kept my belly full as well as my heart. It’s my father’s lifelong work and it’s made me respect him sooo much after 30 years of being there to cook for 14+ hours a day. I don’t know who i’d be without this restaurant. It’s shaped me in ways that i couldn’t possibly explain over a reddit post. It’s made me confident, brave, not scared of a little heat, and i’ve built incredible relationships with a staff that i’ve been so lucky to work with for so long. 

I started taking it seriously when i was about 15. I was a busgirl at first. And then i was a hostess. And when i got a little older i became a server. I wasn’t very good at that one, especially after spilling red wine on one-too-many older women and embarrassing myself beyond compare. I realized at 18 or so, that like my father, i was a cook. I’m 24 now and i’ve been cooking alongside my dad everyday since i realized i had a knack for it. It’s been beautiful, exhausting, exhilarating, very mentally and emotionally taxing — just an overall whirlwind of emotions every single day. I even made the crazy decision to drop out of college to run the restaurant full-time. I love it though. I love working with my family. I love making people happy and seeing them enjoy the food we work so hard to make. 

Tonight is our last shift ever. Things were going so well over the holidays this past winter but ever since covid hit, it’s been a different story. We had to close to the public for 3 months. And since we’ve been open with limited occupancy, we’re not pulling in those great numbers that we once were. We can no longer afford the rent at our building and had to make the tough decision to close our doors for good. But besides that, it’s time. My parents are in their 60’s. My dad can’t do it anymore. His health is starting to drastically fail because of all the years being constantly on his feet. and he doesn’t want me to have the same life that he did, never being able to give any part of life besides work real attention. My mom and dad are ready to retire and i don’t blame them. 

I’m nervous about tonight. After all these years, this very well might be the last restaurant shift i ever work. I don’t know what the future holds for me, but i don’t think i have any interest continuing my cooking career elsewhere. I decided that without the restaurant, there’s not much keeping me in our town so in October i’m going to take a big risk and move across the country. I’m terrified. I’ve been terrified every day leading up to today. It’s hard to imagine what life is going to be like for me after we close our doors tonight. I’ve just never known anything else. 

I thought it might feel good to tell this story to some faceless strangers. If you read this far, thank you. 

Please continue to support your locally-owned restaurants. The families who own them put a lot of blood, sweat, and tears into running them. Tip your servers well. Thank the chefs if you run into them. Enjoy good food for the rest of your life and eat it with passion. Cheers and buon appetito.

EDIT: the response from this has been absolutely INCREDIBLE. thank you so much for this amazing outpour of love. the shift just ended. i’m sitting in the office alone and thinking about it all, reading these amazing messages from people all across the globe. you’re all wonderful and if it’s any consolation, you’ve made my heart feel so warm. i feel a bit in shock and ready to drink some tequila and enjoy the rest of the night with my coworkers in true restaurant fashion. i’m going to try to respond to all of you in due time. thank you so much. 

2. since this blew up i thought i’d shoot my shot and say i’m planning on moving to Pittsburgh in october. i don’t have a job lined up so if anyone has any openings, let me know! i’m a hard worker and terrified to move with no plans. i just know it’s time to get out of South Carolina. also if you live in pittsburgh and are looking for a new friend, also message me! i don’t know anyone there and would love to meet some of you Yinzers.

3. a lot of people saying they don’t understand how we don’t have enough money to stay open after 30 years. you need to understand that my parents are old. they do have money put aside. but we moved into a newer, bigger location 5 years ago and our asshole landlord doubled the rent 2 years ago. my parents have been putting money from their own pockets into the restaurant for the last year or so. they could keep it up for a few more years, sure. but then they’d lose all their retirement money. the future of restaurants, especially fine dining, is very uncertain right now. my parents would rather retire now and be able to live off their profits for a few years, than put all their remaining money into it for the next 5-10 years and then have nothing. it’s clearly a big decision we’ve been going back and forth on for the past few months. we came to this decision. i respect them for pulling out now at the end of our 5 year lease instead of risking it all. they deserve this. they deserve retirement. it’s time for them to rest and enjoy their time together.

4. so many people are asking why a random place like pittsburgh. i don’t know. i’ve been obsessed with PGH since i was in early highschool and just haven’t been able to get it out of my head. i like the bridges. i like the neighborhoods. i like the hills. i like the parks. and the cobblestone roads. PNC park is the most beautiful ballpark in the country. i love the pride pittsburghers have for their city (something that i never quite felt from the town i grew up in, regardless of the restaurant). i think it’s the most beautiful city in the united states. my favourite artist in the world, mac miller, is from there. it’s a city but it’s not this huge sprawling metropolis like chicago, or NYC, or philly, or LA. i want to be cold. i want to meet strangers with funny accents and have them show me the secret spots in the city. i want to fall in love with pittsburgh like how the people who have lived there their whole lives love it. why not pittsburgh? it seems like the perfect place for me.

Edit: Wow, wow, wow! I really didn’t expect this post to get so much attention! Thank you all so much for your kind words and encouragement! I posted this with the intent to let people know that kids from low-income families will be fed, at least in many places that are closing schools, because I know it’s been a topic of concern for a lot of people. I certainly didn’t expect to be called a hero, it’s a little overwhelming and I’m not sure I deserve the title. I’m doing my job. I love my students, every day I see the same kids come in, I know most of them by name. I’ve had little kids who have had a hard day come in with tears in their eyes but light up when they see their favorite lunch being served. I’ve given many a high five to kids who let me know that they tried a new food yesterday and liked it. I’ve tied so, so, SO many little sneaker shoelaces. 

Originally this job was just a stepping stone, a job to make money because I fell on some hard times. I fell out with my parents and left their home on bad terms, lost my previous job suddenly, and worst of all dropped out of college because I couldn’t afford it. I was going to school to become a kindergarten teacher and when I saw the job opening for a lunch lady, I figured it was worth a shot. Better than unemployment. Not only has it been so much more rewarding than I ever imagined, it has really cemented how much I want to continue my education somehow to become a kindergarten/1st grade teacher. My love for these little ones, even on the worst days, is overwhelming. The thought of them going hungry hurts my heart and soul, to the core of my being. So, of course I will do my best to feed them when their parents are struggling to make ends meet. 

Thank you so much for all of you who have shared your stories with me of how the lunch ladies and gentlemen have touched your life. I’ve smiled and cried so much since I posted this, I’m truly touched by the response.


EDIT #2:
Well, this post sure got more attention than I expected it to! I'm really happy to see so many people sharing stories about their experience with lunch ladies and cafeteria staff. It's a great reminder of why we do what we do. I've noticed a lot of people have been asking questions, so let me answer them the best I can!

-I'm in Virginia, USA. Chesterfield County, specifically. 

-While schools are closed, kids can get their meals without having to go into the schools or be exposed to potential illness, we are doing a drive-up, curbside pickup system to minimize exposure. I have heard of other places also doing a delivery system so families without transportation can still receive meals.

-I know that it is appalling that in America, a first world and developed country that is home to some of the wealthiest people on the planet, children are still going hungry. It's appalling that there are parents having children they can't afford to feed and clothe. Right now, neither of those things are my focus. My focus is not to judge these parents or delve into the politics of how this has been allowed to happen. My goal is to make sure that no child in my district is going hungry because schools are having to close due to COVID-19. 

-If you want to help in your own community, there are some options you can look into. First of all, reach out to your own local schools, see what they need. Ask them how you can help. Reach out to food banks in your area. Check in with sources like Feeding America and see what's being done in your area to help out.

-Enough people have reached out to me and asked if I have a gofundme, or have talked about starting one for me to go back to school and achieve my dream of being an elementary school teacher, so I went ahead and made one. Please, nobody needs to feel obligated to give me anything, but I have learned not to question kindness and generosity. Here is the link, if anyone is so inclined:  https://www.gofundme.com/f/help-this-lunch-lady-become-a-teacher?utm_source=customer&amp;utm_medium=copy_link&amp;utm_campaign=p_cf+share-flow-1",t2_bx21xut,False,,16,False,"I’m a lunch lady at an elementary school school.

I fell out with my parents and left their home on bad terms, lost my previous job suddenly, and worst of all dropped out of college because I couldn’t afford it. I was going to school to become a kindergarten teacher and when I saw the job opening for a lunch lady, I figured it was worth a shot. Better than unemployment. Not only has it been so much more rewarding than I ever imagined, it has really cemented how much I want to continue my education somehow to become a kindergarten/1st grade teacher. My love for these little ones, even on the worst days, is overwhelming. The thought of them going hungry hurts my heart and soul, to the core of my being. So, of course I will do my best to feed them when their parents are struggling to make ends meet. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thank you so much for all of you who have shared your stories with me of how the lunch ladies and gentlemen have touched your life. I’ve smiled and cried so much since I posted this, I’m truly touched by the response.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;EDIT #2:
Well, this post sure got more attention than I expected it to! I&amp;#39;m really happy to see so many people sharing stories about their experience with lunch ladies and cafeteria staff. It&amp;#39;s a great reminder of why we do what we do. I&amp;#39;ve noticed a lot of people have been asking questions, so let me answer them the best I can!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;-I&amp;#39;m in Virginia, USA. Chesterfield County, specifically. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;-While schools are closed, kids can get their meals without having to go into the schools or be exposed to potential illness, we are doing a drive-up, curbside pickup system to minimize exposure. I have heard of other places also doing a delivery system so families without transportation can still receive meals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;-I know that it is appalling that in America, a first world and developed country that is home to some of the wealthiest people on the planet, children are still going hungry. It&amp;#39;s appalling that there are parents having children they can&amp;#39;t afford to feed and clothe. Right now, neither of those things are my focus. My focus is not to judge these parents or delve into the politics of how this has been allowed to happen. My goal is to make sure that no child in my district is going hungry because schools are having to close due to COVID-19. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;-If you want to help in your own community, there are some options you can look into. First of all, reach out to your own local schools, see what they need. Ask them how you can help. Reach out to food banks in your area. Check in with sources like Feeding America and see what&amp;#39;s being done in your area to help out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;-Enough people have reached out to me and asked if I have a gofundme, or have talked about starting one for me to go back to school and achieve my dream of being an elementary school teacher, so I went ahead and made one. Please, nobody needs to feel obligated to give me anything, but I have learned not to question kindness and generosity. Here is the link, if anyone is so inclined:  &lt;a href=""https://www.gofundme.com/f/help-this-lunch-lady-become-a-teacher?utm_source=customer&amp;amp;utm_medium=copy_link&amp;amp;utm_campaign=p_cf+share-flow-1""&gt;https://www.gofundme.com/f/help-this-lunch-lady-become-a-teacher?utm_source=customer&amp;amp;utm_medium=copy_link&amp;amp;utm_campaign=p_cf+share-flow-1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
