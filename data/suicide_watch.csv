###Summary###

**It's important to respect and understand people's experiences and emotions. It's never necessary, helpful, or kind to support suicidal intent. There are some common misconceptions (discussed below) about suicidal people and how to help them that can cause well-meaning people to inadvertently incite suicide. There are also people online who incite suicide on purpose, often while pretending to be sympathetic and helpful.** 

###Validate Feelings and Experiences, Not Self-Destructive Intentions###

We're here to offer support, not judgement.  That means accepting, with the best understanding we can offer, whatever emotions people express.  Suicidal people are suffering, and we're here to try to ease that by providing support and caring.  The most reliable way we know to de-escalate someone at risk is to give them the experience of feeling understood. That means not judging whether they should be feeling the way they are, or telling them what to do or not do.  

But there's an important line to draw here.  There's a crucial difference between empathizing with feelings and responding non-judgmentally to suicidal thoughts, and in any way endorsing, encouraging, or validating suicidal intentions or hopeless beliefs. 

Anything that condones suicide, even passively, *encourages* suicide. It isn't supportive and does not help. It also violates reddit's sitewide rules as well as our guidelines. Explicitly inciting suicide online is a criminal offense in most jurisdictions. 

Do not treat any OP's post as meaning that will definitely die by suicide and can't change their minds or be helped. Anyone who's able to read the comments here still has a chance to choose whether or not to try to keep living, even if they've also been experiencing intense thoughts of suicide, made a suicide plan, or started carrying it out.  

In [the most useful empirical model we have](https://www.apa.org/science/about/psa/2009/06/sci-brief), the desire to die by suicide primarily comes from two interpersonal factors; alienation and a sense of being a burden or having nothing to offer. These factors usually lead to a profound feeling of being unwelcome in the world. 

**So, any acceptance or reinforcement of suicidal intent, even something ""innocent"" like ""I hope you find peace"", is actually a form of covert shunning that validates a person's sense that they're unwelcome in the world. It will usually add to their pain even if kindly meant and gently worded.**  

###How to Avoid Validating Suicidal Intent###

Keep the following in mind when offering support to anyone at risk for suicide.  

* **People who say they don't want help usually can feel better if they get support that doesn't invalidate their emotions.** Unfortunately, [many popular ""good"" responses are actually counterproductive](https://www.speakingofsuicide.com/2015/03/03/what-not-to-say/). In particular, many friends and family tend to rely exclusively on trying to convince the suicidal person that ""it's not so bad"", and this is usually experienced as ""I don't understand what you're going through and I'm not going to try"".  People who've had ""help"" that made them feel worse don't want any more of the same.  It doesn't mean that someone who actually knows how to be supportive can't give them any comfort.   

*  **Most people who are suicidal want to end their** ***pain,*** **not their lives.**  It's almost never true that death is the only way to end these people's suffering. Of course there are exceptional situations, and we certainly acknowledge that, for some people, the right help can be difficult to find. But preventing someone's suicide doesn't mean prolonging their suffering if we do it by giving them real comfort and understanding. 

* ***An unfixable problem doesn't mean that a good life will never be possible***.  We don't have to fix or change anything to help someone feel better. It's important to keep in mind that the correlation between our outer circumstances and our inner experience is weaker and less direct than commonly assumed.  For every kind of difficult life situation, you will find some people who lapse into suicidal despair, and others who cope amazingly well, and a whole spectrum in between. A key difference is how much inner resilience the person has at the time. This can depend on many personal and situational factors. But when there's not enough, interpersonal support can both compensate for its absence and help rebuild it.  We go into more depth on the ""it gets better"" issue in [this PSA Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/25igd7/whats_wrong_with_it_gets_better_what_if_it_doesnt/) which is always linked from our sidebar (community info on mobile) guidelines. 

* **There are** ***always*** **more choices than brutally forcing someone to stay alive or passively letting them end their lives**.

To avoid accidentally breaking the anti-incitement rule, don't say or try to imply that acting on suicidal thoughts is a good idea, or that someone can't turn back or is already dead.  Do whatever you can to help them feel cared for and welcome, at least in this little corner of the world.  [Our talking tips](http://redd.it/igh87) offer more detailed guidance.

###Look Out for Deliberate Incitement.  It May Come in Disguise.###

Often comments that subtly encourage suicidal intent actually come from suicide fetishists and voyeurs ([unfortunately this is a real and disturbing phenomenon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Francis_Melchert-Dinkel)). People like this *are* out there and the anonymous nature of reddit makes us particularly attractive to them.  

They will typically try to scratch their psychological ""itch"" by saying things that push people closer to the edge.  They often do this by exploiting the myths that we debunked in the bullet points above.  Specifically you might see people doing the following:

* Encouraging the false belief that the only way suicidal people can end their pain is by dying.  **There are** ***always*** **more and better choices than ""brutally forcing someone to stay alive"" or helping (actively or passively) them to end their lives**.

* Creating an artificial and toxic sense of ""solidarity"" by linking their encouragement of suicide to empathy.  They will represent themselves as the only one who really understand the suicidal person, while either directly or indirectly encouraging their self-loathing emotions and self-destructive impulses.  **Since most people in suicidal crisis are in desperate need to empathy and understanding, this is a particularly dangerous form of manipulation.**  

Many suicide inciters are adept at putting a benevolent spin on their activities while actually luring people away from sources of real help.  A couple of key points to keep in mind: 

* **Skilled suicide intervention -- peer or professional -- is based on empathic responsiveness to the person's feelings that reduces their suffering in the moment.**  Contrary to pop-culture myths, it does **not** involve persuasion (""Don't do it!""), cheerleading (""You've got this!"") or meaningless false promises (""Trust me, it gets better!""), or invalidation (""Let me show you how things aren't as bad as you think!"").  Anyone who leads others to expect these kinds of toxic responses, or any other response that prolongs their pain, from expert help may be covertly pro-suicide. (Of course, people sometimes do have bad experience when seeking mental-health treatment, and it's fine to vent about those, but processing our own disappointment and frustration is entirely different from trying to destroy someone else's hope of getting help.)

* **Choices made by competent responders are always informed by the understanding that breaching someone's trust is traumatic and must be avoided if possible.**  Any kind of involuntary intervention is an **extremely unlikely** outcome when someone consults a clinician or calls a hotline. (Confidentiality is addressed in more detail in [our Hotlines FAQ post](http://redd.it/1c7ntr)). The goal is always to provide all help with the client's full knowledge and informed consent. We know that no individual or system is perfect.  Mistakes that lead to bad experiences do sometimes happen to vulnerable people, and we have enormous sympathy for them. But anyone who suggests that this is the norm might be trying to scare people away from the help they need.

* Advocating for changes in cultural norms or common perceptions around mental-health.  These are often related to specific days devoted to specific causes, e.g. World Suicide Prevention Day

&lt;p&gt;Edit:  In response to multiple requests, I&amp;#39;m adding a definition of activism here:  &amp;quot;campaigning to bring about political or social change&amp;quot;.  That&amp;#39;s straight out of the OED, we aren&amp;#39;t making any special interpretation of it. &lt;strong&gt;Any post that is primarily about raising awareness or changing perceptions is activism according to the dictionary definition and thus a violation of the community rules.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

You’ve made me happy, you’ve made me sad, you’ve given me confidence, you’ve made me feel awful. 
You’ve played with me. 
You’ve made promises you never intended to keep.
I’ve made choices so we could be together.
I’ve pictured a whole life for us.
And then you’ve changed your mind.
You’ve managed to destroy me. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I shouldn’t have let you destroy me. I was weak in the first place. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What’s the point of being alive and being alone? I don’t have you anymore, I don’t have friends. I have work and that’s all. And work gets boring. You don’t live just to work. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I just feel like I’m ready to give up. I don’t believe it can get better anymore, because if it does get better, it’s only going to get worse afterwards. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m done.&lt;/p&gt;

,SuicideWatch,"Recently, I've realized just how important variety and freshness is in everyday life. I know that many of the tips I will list below are not possible when you are in a particularly dark place, but I thought I'd mention them anyway — perhaps something will be of help to you. Here are a few things that help me keep overwhelming bouts of anxiety and ideation at bay: 

* Push yourself to wake up a little earlier. Stretch slowly with deep breaths and take a walk around your neighborhood as the sky turns rosy-yellow. Try to appreciate the new day; think of something, anything, to look forward to. Return home for a  warm shower and freshly-laundered clothes.
* Sleep a little bit earlier. Wash your sheets and buy a few soft blankets to make your bed into a cozy sanctuary. Allot time for reading or journalling to clear your mind.
* Allot time to cook simple, lovely meals. Steam fresh vegetables, cook some rice, or cut up a fruit salad of apples, bananas, and citrus. Eat mindfully and drink plenty of water. 
* Buy a well-bound journal and a good quality pen. Write down achievable to-do lists, make calendars, note groceries, thoughts, haikus —  anything. Put your thoughts in ink; appreciate daily observations. 
* Reorganize your space, or at least a little section of it. Listen to a nice podcast as you do so. Put your sheets and pillowcase into the laundry. Clear out your shelves and drawers, sort through everything, and replace it all neatly. Light a lovely candle and add some fresh flowers. Open a window or two.
* Buy or borrow a book on any topic which sparks even the slightest interest. Crocheting? Botany? Medieval history? Delving into a new topic just for the sake of it is worthwhile.
* Embrace non-competitive hobbies. This is incredibly important in a product(ivity)-obsessed society which devalues craftsmanship and pure interests. Activities like the following enrich your daily life and force you to set aside some time away from mandatory tasks: needle-felting, gardening, writing (poems, books, articles, blogs), painting, photography, wood-whittling, typography, graphic design, etc. Ensure that whatever you choose, the hobby involves holding the  fruits of your labor in your hands. You do not have to be ""good"" at it –  this is not a career choice. Watching yourself grow and have fun with  it is success in and of itself.

I’m turning 25 in a few days, I’m married to a good man who loves me but we’ve struggled with communication and compatibility so we’ve been in therapy working on it. It’s hard work.

I can’t keep a job, I’m currently unemployed and have no skills or qualifications in anything that is even remotely interesting to me. I hate not contributing financially and we’re struggling. We can barely eat right now, it’s humiliating. And it’s my fault. I struggle with infertility, all we want is to start our family. I can’t even do that. I never finished college and I have the debt to remind me every day. It’s not going to get easier. I’m an adult. Nothing significant is going to change and make things easier. I’ll never have the life I dream of, so what’s the point?

I’ve overcome so much with anxiety and OCD. But it’s still here and it really burns me out sometimes. I keep thinking about my future and how scary it is to age. I’m not afraid of dying, but I’m afraid of ceasing to exist if that makes sense. Who will be there at the end? Will I get sick? Will my husband? We could be in accidents, I could lose him to something traumatic, anything could happen. How do people live their whole lives? Becoming 40 feels so unrealistic.

I’m not doing anything big or exciting or impactful. I’m turning 25 in a few days, I’m married to a good man who loves me but we’ve struggled with communication and compatibility so we’ve been in therapy working on it. It’s hard work. He’s worth it, I love him, I’m in love with him, he’s my best friend and partner, but I didn’t think it would be this hard. Nobody talks about how hard being a couple is, it’s all “it shouldn’t be hard with the right person” and that makes me feel like a failure. I feel like a failure in everything in my life. I can’t keep a job, I’m currently unemployed and have no skills or qualifications in anything that is even remotely interesting to me. I hate not contributing financially and we’re struggling. We can barely eat right now, it’s humiliating. And it’s my fault. I struggle with infertility, all we want is to start our family. I can’t even do that.

,SuicideWatch,"Hi, I am having a v intense realization that I’ve been depressed for a very long time. Though you wouldn’t think that if you met me. Every day I slap on a smile and ask myself, “what kind of beauty am I going to see today?” and I allow life to flow. People say I’m so nice and so happy, so fun and charming. I had gotten so good at it I had even convinced myself for the passed 10yrs that I’ve been happy. Truth is though I don’t think I’d know happiness if it hit me in the face. 
I think I’ve been depressed since young childhood, coming from a wildly dysfunctional military home, being constantly bullied, I turned to sex drugs and alcohol at a very young age in order to cope. Now I’m 25, in a big city, feeling more isolated than ever. I work two jobs, I was going to university but decided to drop out to do a trade. I decided to be poly because I felt so lonely in monogamous relationships but poly has been nothing but heartache. I live with a close friend who doesn’t clean at all and constantly has his girl friend over even tho he works nights and she has her own apartment. I don’t know how to set boundaries because no one has ever respected them. I’ve been in and out of therapy (currently out but I guess almost back in). I’ve been assaulted and abused. My cat has never cuddled me. I don’t know how to make deep connections with people or how to keep friendships. Then I think about the state of the world and feel so helpless and hopeless.

,SuicideWatch,"By nature of my mental health conditions, I'm someone who doesnt really have any aspirations in life and even if I did I wouldnt have the energy or stability to achieve it, as has proven to be the case in the past. I wouldnt say im depressed but more just apathetic and accepting of the thought that nothing will change, that this is as good as it gets. I've experienced all that I've wanted to experience so what more is there to do except wait to die? 

Im not interested in marriage, children or any type of career. I just spend all day sleeping, eating and watching TV which is getting boring after doing it for several years. It wouldnt be so bad if I could enjoy some of my solitary hobbies that I used to enjoy but now I just pick something up and then lose interest within a few minutes. It just feels like I'm delaying the inevitable at this point as I dont know how many more years I can put up with doing the same old crap until something other than myself kills me.

I feel guilty for thinking it but I just wish that my 2 family members that I'm close to would die just so that I can't feel guilty in my last moments about leaving them with grief. Then again, I know it'd be a relief for them in a way knowing that I wont be hopelessly trying to survive without them in this life. It's becoming easier to see the potential positives to me killing myself compared to the negatives. 

What's worse is that I'm transgender and have completed my transition (F&gt;M) but rather than it being a lease of life, its become more like a 'phew, at least now I can die in peace' type of situation. So theres a peaceful element involved now which makes it all the more tempting.

&lt;p&gt;Im not interested in marriage, children or any type of career. I just spend all day sleeping, eating and watching TV which is getting boring after doing it for several years. It wouldnt be so bad if I could enjoy some of my solitary hobbies that I used to enjoy but now I just pick something up and then lose interest within a few minutes. It just feels like I&amp;#39;m delaying the inevitable at this point as I dont know how many more years I can put up with doing the same old crap until something other than myself kills me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I feel guilty for thinking it but I just wish that my 2 family members that I&amp;#39;m close to would die just so that I can&amp;#39;t feel guilty in my last moments about leaving them with grief. Then again, I know it&amp;#39;d be a relief for them in a way knowing that I wont be hopelessly trying to survive without them in this life. It&amp;#39;s becoming easier to see the potential positives to me killing myself compared to the negatives. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What&amp;#39;s worse is that I&amp;#39;m transgender and have completed my transition (F&amp;gt;M) but rather than it being a lease of life, its become more like a &amp;#39;phew, at least now I can die in peace&amp;#39; type of situation. So theres a peaceful element involved now which makes it all the more tempting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Im just progressively finding it harder to see a point in living and it doesn&amp;#39;t seem like anything is able to change it at this point&lt;/p&gt;

Bit of backstory my boyfriend (5 years) had called me while I was at work on Monday saying that he was checking himself into a mental health hospital. I knew roughly why he would be there but it was still such a shock to me. It wasnt until a few days later that he opened up to me and said that he had made a plan and chose out the weapon but decided after his therapy session that he didnt want to do it anymore. So it's a weird in between spot. While he didnt necessarily attempt suicide he was damn close. Closer than I ever could have imagined.
I had just started a new job with a bakery about a month ago and then this happened. I've had a hard time coping with everything and so I told my boss I probably wouldn't be back until the following Monday. Fast forward to Friday I get a call from one of my friends who helped get me the job and she's saying that my work team is trying to be understanding but that they think and my friend thinks I'm being immature and irresponsible for not going to work. My friend even went far enough to say that maybe I wasn't strong enough for my boyfriend since I couldn't find it in myself to go to work through this. 
I guess I'm asking for advice. My friend said my work is talking about cutting my hours since now I've shown I'm not reliable even though before this happened I had never so much as shown up late before or called out.

It wasnt until a few days later that he opened up to me and said that he had made a plan and chose out the weapon but decided after his therapy session that he didnt want to do it anymore. So it&amp;#39;s a weird in between spot. While he didnt necessarily attempt suicide he was damn close. Closer than I ever could have imagined.
I had just started a new job with a bakery about a month ago and then this happened. I&amp;#39;ve had a hard time coping with everything and so I told my boss I probably wouldn&amp;#39;t be back until the following Monday. Fast forward to Friday I get a call from one of my friends who helped get me the job and she&amp;#39;s saying that my work team is trying to be understanding but that they think and my friend thinks I&amp;#39;m being immature and irresponsible for not going to work. My friend even went far enough to say that maybe I wasn&amp;#39;t strong enough for my boyfriend since I couldn&amp;#39;t find it in myself to go to work through this. 
I guess I&amp;#39;m asking for advice. My friend said my work is talking about cutting my hours since now I&amp;#39;ve shown I&amp;#39;m not reliable even though before this happened I had never so much as shown up late before or called out. What would you do? I feel at a loss because yes I realize I should be working but I don&amp;#39;t know how to face my work after this especially knowing they are annoyed with me.&lt;/p&gt;

,SuicideWatch,"Howdy. I don't know why I'm posting like it's going to do anything for me but whatever. This is gonna be pretty wordy. A fella out here fighting the long fight. Everything's shit. Everything's been shit since I was like 11. There hasn't been a day in at least 5-6 years that suicide hasn't crossed my mind. I've managed to stay pretty functional. Less so now. I can't do anything. I'm used to having bad days. I'm used to that. But for the longest time my bad days were maximum 17 hours in bed then I get up to piss or something. It's different now. My bad days are 31 hours in bed no food or water. I don't go online, I don't talk to anyone, I just sulk. Everything's gone to shit. 

My family is big against any sort of therapy/mental illness sort of talk. I was too. Last year in August I broke down and started therapy because I knew I was slacking. I decided If not to change my mood, then to at least change my behavior. It helped for a while. Cut to December. I'm off my shit. I break down again and resort to meds. I've always been against meds for myself so idk maybe that adds some perspective. I felt like meds were the equivalent of me giving up my personality, becoming the masses. Pretentious I know but whatever. Meds don't do shit. I've had so many appointments with my psychiatrist to change my meds or the dosage but nothing has worked and it's been too long. 

I decided to go into an outpatient program in February. Things were really bad. I started disassociating very intensely. I can't feel my body move, I can't control my motions. It's one of the most terrifying things I've ever experienced. I went through the application process and got accepted into outpatient care. I was finally going to get thorough help. Confidentiality had been broken, relationships irreparable but I was going to do what I needed to do. The day I start I find out my insurance doesn't cover it.

I am so fucking tired of being too poor. I'm tired. It's so fucking humiliating to not be able to take care of yourself because you can't afford it. When I grew up everyone thought I was gonna be the kid to escape this shit. To break the cycle and actually make something of myself and be content. I was smart, I was bilingual and inventive and passionate and I learned about how to best fight my circumstances. I really thought I had a chance. But I don't.

There's no escaping the cycle of poverty. It comes back to bite no matter what you do.  My grades suffered because I didn't have a computer, or internet, or because I was losing my apartment or whatever the crisis might've been at the time. My grades are shit now, like a 1. something gpa. I can't get a scholarship and to be totally fucking honest I'm not sure I'd even graduate high school. I'm a financial drain on all my guardians. My mom won't buy me food, my dad is trying to not lose his other kid, and my grandma (who raised me) is forced to live with my dad and pay off the house because he can't afford it and knew he could leech off of her. I can't work because I'm already failing all my classes and I'm supposed to fix that.

The worst part is being aware of my situation. I can't afford to be healthy. I can't afford to be educated. I can't afford to be happy. How fucked up is that? I don't try and paint myself as the victim of this dumb ass capitalist society but come ON. It doesn't matter how I play the game. It doesn't matter how hard I try and be better. I can't pay for it. If I keep going, then in 10 years I'm gonna be a deadbeat working three jobs in some toxic relationship just like every other adult in my life. 

I can't have a life. I can't pay for it. If I kill myself that's like max a $7000 funeral. I have about a thousand and my family probably wouldn't spend that much anyway. Hell, if I can get rid of the body they won't even have to deal with that. No more food expenses, no more school expenses, no more health expenses. They can sell my shit, rent out my room, i don't care: I'll be fucking dead what do I need all this shit for? I can't keep up. Every time I turn a corner there's some new crisis to be dealt with.

,SuicideWatch,"Ive been going pretty good for some time.  
Got a flat, got a job, stayed clean for an almost year (except cigs and beers why I try limit as much as i can).  
I even had established morning routine before job like exercising and meditations. I were even writing daily journal which helped me a lot with memory and thinking. Exercising proved to be excelent whenever my attention started to go jumpy. I was going to sleep at exact time and woke a exact time same. It wasnt exactly perfect but it was better then before.   


And then i dont know  what happened. Guess its the freaking weather and loneliness along with overthinking that got me back into this moodiness.  
I guess I kind off hoped my father and mother would be freaking proud of me to stop dragging people into the same hole i was in and using.  
that they would be proud i found the job and keep it , that i try  even through i have health complications. But none of it happened. They each have their own families and im just a waste with no one to talk to except for my therapist and girlfriend. And I dont even know how to grateful to at least have someone since they dont understand how I am feeling.  
I just sit home trying to live someones else life inside comics and playing the same game over and over again even through i hate it. Trying to find a way to get away with assisted suicide because I cant do a shit right.  
Most depressing thing I realized is that it doesnt really matter how much i try to change myself. People instenctively hate me. That it doesnt matter if i try to live ""normal"" life. it still sucks. It doesnt matter if am clean or not , since no one cares. Everywhere i go theres this black cloud of my negativity transfering my bad ""mojo"" onto other people. Im burden to my gf since im most of the last month only sad piece of shit that cant do nothing to make this life better. Im burden even to her friends who took a pity on my cause im depressed shit.  
It doesnt even matter if i would die. No one cares a one piece of shit. All gonna be friends till I had money and drugs , they called adn talked about their problems , but now when im down theres no one.  
Im just waiting till dignitas answer me with mail so I can start preparing to leave this shitty hole called reality.   
Ive been trough so much.. Be it Abusive childhood, Abusive ex, Depressions since I was 11, Bullying, Drug addiction , anxieties, agoraphobia, so called ""desilusions"", Fake friends who destroyed any bit of my ability to trust a different human being, Being forced by a girl to almost having sex when i was 6, Constant Isolations ,School failures, being scapegoated, being hospitalised , tried to kill myself 3 times, Being left on my own my whole life with no support from my so called parents who just made everything worse. I cant get over it.   
I keep hearing all those bullshits like ""just change your thinking man"". How the heck am i supposed to change something that has been hardwired into my head for years when i was still a child.  


Id love to make comics, Id love to make music but i cant do anything else except for reading and playing over and over again , cause i have no energy to do anything. Worst part is I can hear laughing all the people I know. And even worse part is I know no one will answer this post again , cause theres just no other way than to ends this miserable piece of shit thats called my life.  
I hate all those people who think Assisted-suicide/Euthanasia shouldnt be avaible to people with mental illness. It is like saying ""people with cancer doesnt deserve to die a calm way.""

,SuicideWatch,"- Chronic pain from TMJ (I can’t even eat, eat mushy or liquid foods), can’t talk or sing much anymore, just lay in bed and sleep to escape pain 

- Chronic sinus infections (I can’t breathe, always feel like I’m about to sneeze, eyes swollen shut half the day)

- I try to be a kind person the best I can. I’ve never yelled at a stranger or friend or boyfriend. I’ve never cheated. I’m not clingy. I support everyone with everything they do, and I give people hundreds of chances to change. I make food for people. If someone has a problem, even a random person who hasn’t been the nicest, I will talk to them and try to give them solutions. I try to put out good karma into this world. I know I won’t be here much longer, so might as well make a positive impact. I try to not be stepped on either though. 

- Chronic inflammation and skin conditions (acne, eczema, every pore on my leg is purple and inflamed, eyelids are always inflamed and crusty and often swollen completely shut, family thinks I exaggerate these symptoms and that I just naturally look swollen and red or whatever)

- Zero friends. Not exaggerating. Not one friend. Never had a close friend before. I’ve had depression ever since I’m 10. I text some people occasionally but no one I’m close to who I can share my feelings or hang out with.

- Was raped. No one acknowledged, and when they did realize, told me to be more picky with my sexual partners. I couldn’t have been more picky. I was passed out.

- Not in school (even though I had a 4.2 GPA and 1550 SAT). Was homeschooled 10-12th grade high school. Went to liberal arts college in another state has manic/psychotic episodes had to go back home. Started community college but parents pulled me out during my depressive episode.

- No trust in men. I can never have a normal relationship. Besides being raped, I had men bombard me with videos of porn stars and detail why I wasn’t as hot as them, inspect me for flaws, take advantage of my past trauma as part of their kink, lie to me about being married, tell me that the only reason they like me is because I’m psycho or dumb, etc. I shouldn’t have been dating during this bad time. During my Klonopin withdrawal period, I had a panic attack and a guy just drove away.

- OCD thoughts nonstop. I’m scared of even thinking certain thoughts. I’m convinced certain thoughts or not having certainty thoughts will jinx my future. I’m scared I’m a sexual deviant (even though I have no libido and am a straight vanilla female with only 2 sexual partners ever 3 including rape). I’m convinced I’m becoming a hermaphrodite, or that I’m actually transgender. Weird thoughts.

- Eating disorder. Scared of being fat, also scared of being skinny. I just want to look ill. I don’t want to look like a girl that men fetishize. Look small and thin and pedophiles will want to rape me. Look curvy and I’ll be objectified. I can’t stop bingeing and purging. I was underweight then a guy was checking me out now I want to become fat.

- Mom harassed me for my nude photos. She imitated how I took the photos, this is what drove me to attempt suicide. She showed them to my dad and sister and now everyone thinks I’m a slut and my sister tells my cousin about how I sleep with many men on the first date. 

- Blatant preferential treatment for my sister. She gets her laptop fixed, I don’t. She gets haircuts, I don’t. While I was getting a seizure from Klonopin withdrawals, my mom was shopping for a custom coat for my sister for hours and when I told my mom what happened she said something like “oh that’s not nice.”

- Hundreds of people know my diagnosis and think I’m crazy. My sister had a fundraiser for mental illness to help her get into a good college and to make it more inspirational she shared my health information with many people who now treat me weird.

- Everyone outside our family like extended family and family friends also are super patronizing and treat me as this person you want to be cordial with but also not get close to and are super patronizing 

I need someone to talk to so badly. I’ve felt this way for so so so long. No one cares. I feel invisible. I swear I can tell aloud that I want to kill my self and no one would care.

Went to liberal arts college in another state has manic/psychotic episodes had to go back home. Started community college but parents pulled me out during my depressive episode.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;No trust in men. I can never have a normal relationship. Besides being raped, I had men bombard me with videos of porn stars and detail why I wasn’t as hot as them, inspect me for flaws, take advantage of my past trauma as part of their kink, lie to me about being married, tell me that the only reason they like me is because I’m psycho or dumb, etc. I shouldn’t have been dating during this bad time. During my Klonopin withdrawal period, I had a panic attack and a guy just drove away.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;OCD thoughts nonstop. I’m scared of even thinking certain thoughts. I’m convinced certain thoughts or not having certainty thoughts will jinx my future. I’m scared I’m a sexual deviant (even though I have no libido and am a straight vanilla female with only 2 sexual partners ever 3 including rape). I’m convinced I’m becoming a hermaphrodite, or that I’m actually transgender. Weird thoughts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Eating disorder. Scared of being fat, also scared of being skinny. I just want to look ill. I don’t want to look like a girl that men fetishize. Look small and thin and pedophiles will want to rape me. Look curvy and I’ll be objectified. I can’t stop bingeing and purging. I was underweight then a guy was checking me out now I want to become fat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mom harassed me for my nude photos. She imitated how I took the photos, this is what drove me to attempt suicide. She showed them to my dad and sister and now everyone thinks I’m a slut and my sister tells my cousin about how I sleep with many men on the first date. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Blatant preferential treatment for my sister. She gets her laptop fixed, I don’t. She gets haircuts, I don’t. While I was getting a seizure from Klonopin withdrawals, my mom was shopping for a custom coat for my sister for hours and when I told my mom what happened she said something like “oh that’s not nice.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hundreds of people know my diagnosis and think I’m crazy. My sister had a fundraiser for mental illness to help her get into a good college and to make it more inspirational she shared my health information with many people who now treat me weird.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Everyone outside our family like extended family and family friends also are super patronizing and treat me as this person you want to be cordial with but also not get close to and are super patronizing &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I need someone to talk to so badly. I’ve felt this way for so so so long. No one cares. I feel invisible. I swear I can tell aloud that I want to kill my self and no one would care. I wish someone could ask me if I’m ok. I’ve asked other people so many times if they’re ok can’t remember the last time I’ve been asked that. I’m so selfish I hate it&lt;/p&gt;

I have had three attempts, but I was saved by a person, who himself was alexithymic (I think) and suicidal. He still is, and he says if he doesn&amp;#39;t do well, he will commit suicide.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#39;t know what I&amp;#39;m gonna do if I don&amp;#39;t perform the way I should. But I certainly know that I will die if he does.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In case everything goes wrong, I&amp;#39;ll leave. There&amp;#39;s no other way. The day of my death is nearing. It&amp;#39;s just 3 months away.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Love you all. Have a good day.&lt;/p&gt;

My parents made me go to engineering school, far from their home in paris, after 3 years of preparatory in maths and physics . I immediatly hated the school, i  did a few entreprise visit with my class and i knew i didnt want to be an engineer. I d rather kill myself than becoming one engislave. I made really good friends in this city tho, even if i wasn't going to school anymore  at one point i was still very happy because of them.

So i told my parents i wanted to stop engineering school, that i wanted to get a job until next year when i will go study something i always dreamt about, becoming a doctor. I went back home for holidays, 3 weeks ago.

I have rough background story with my parents, i'm always in conflict with them and until last summer they always solved conflicts by hitting me or insulting me, saying horrible things that made me hate them. They did make me sleep outside for a few days when i was still a good student in preparatory class, they made me bleed several times, my dad with a sharped stick of wood and my mom with her nails.

I told them i wanted to get a job in the city i was studying, far from home, because i could be near my friends. I told them being home with them was torture, that it was making me go insane and suicidal. I'm still at their home rn, i have a job, but i still want to go live in this city, with my friends and my girlfriend who lives there and to get a job there. Nobody talks to me at home, they took my computer and my credit card. I cant go out, i cant see any friend nearby, i cant do anything or enjoy life. 

They want me stay here, no discussion possible. They make me want to kill myself, they repeating every time i talk about my friends that they don't care about me, that they think i'm a looser and  a piece of shit because i stopped this school.

I want to tell my story. I want to be understood. I want to be remembered. Death is stalking us. Suicide or covid-19.  Car wreck  or cancer. Go out in a blaze or just simply die in  your sleep.

It is blind. Death is blind. It just creeps around touching and feeling things until it finds it's prey and then it simply  taps you on the shoulder. Your left shoulder. Then it will whisper it's secret to you.  When you know death's secret, then you are dead. Everything beyond that is a secret.  It is the only secret in the history of the world that has ever been truly kept.    


The dead unswervingly serve their master.  No secrets told .  Death cannot be betrayed.  It cradled you before you born and  will hold you once again when you die. 

It isn't evil. It just IS. Everything just IS. 

I hope i am brave when I  finally feel that tap on my shoulder.  I want to greet death like an old friend because it is.  Death is our mother. It loves us unconditionally and will deny no one of it's love.  Oblivion is just fancy word eternal peace.

I am sorry for any error, english not my first language and I'm very anxious right now. It's a long story and it's kind of confusing, but here we go.

I am depressed since ever, I don't know when it started or how it started, the only thing that I know is that I am depressed since I was a kid and things is getting worse and worse. I was in big crisis in the last two years, life was not what I was expecting to be and things are so complicated, I tried, tried and I am still being fucked by things. So my cousin lives in another country and I asked her if I could stay with her for 3 months until things get better and I can organize myself to live here. So I moved here one month ago and I am trying to build things to live here. Maybe another country, another life maybe things get better, I don't know, I am trying.  
When I asked her if I can stay in her home she was really kind and supportive, it was in august/2019. Then I got here last month and she isn't nice at all. She wakes me up on purpose, she says bad things like ""I can watch my tv cause you are sleeping on the couch"" (the couch is ""my bed"" now). She insinuated that I should find a place for me since the day I arrived here. I try the most to help with things, I clean the house, I wash her clothes, I go the supermarket, I buy the food, I cook the food, I try to be outside the most so I give her a space. And still she's acting bad towards me. I don't know what to do since I asked her to be here for 3 months and after one month things are bad like this. The thing is that I feel so lonely right now and then I tried to talk with her yesterday and she was so mean, she say things like ""people are lonely"", ""grow up that life is hard"", ""cut off this depressed shit"" and others things really mean. The she got out and get really really really drunk with her friends and when she got home, she was another person, she was fun, making jokes, making me laugh, we watch a movie together and I was so fucked up with all the shit that I didn't sleep at all this night. Then she wakes up and starting a argument with me cause the dishes are dirty, but it was her, she used this last night when she was drunk, I tried to talk with her and she just said something like ""I hate that you here"". Now I am really confused. I know that I am not the asshole at all, but will I be the asshole if I kill myself now? I don't wanna kill myself because of her, I just wanna end it all cause I am so full of this shitty life.

,SuicideWatch,"I am almost 40, on disability morbidly obese and can't lose weight no matter how hard I try.   I am almost 40, with nothing but a 500 dollar laptop that my neighbor gave me that is falling apart and only worth around 70 if that. a pair of shoes that are falling apart and hurt when I walk in them. about a dozen worn-out socks and a few shirts and pants all black. mostly sweat pants and two pairs of blue jeans and a worn-out wallet that is falling apart on me. 

I am on disability getting less than 800$ USD a month and have no educational background no GED was homeless for over 8 years and have bad teeth because of it. some need fixing and one needs a new crown. I wasn't taught dental hygiene until I became homeless and even then brushing and flossing was the least of my worries. it was more of getting food and trying to survive. 

I spent the past few years trying to get my GED and failed even with tutors and teachers and study groups found out I have learning issues that make it hard for me to get my GED and I basically have to go from the 2nd and 3rd grade to 12th grade in every subject.

I have no family, no friends. I am utterly alone in this world. Bought a car two years ago was my first car and was planning on living in it but got scammed out of 3k. been trying to save again for another car to live in but been unable to. 

Renting a bedroom from an elderly woman with bad health and she is going in for surgery today if she doesn't make it I will be homeless again nowhere to live and unable to survive being homeless this time. My body has arthritis in my lower back, rheumatoid arthritis in my knees and feet. there's days that I just can't get out of bed because of it hurting so badly. there is no way I can survive being on the streets again.

I feel like complete and utter crap especially compared to everyone else and now realizing how worthless I am in life and maybe it is for the best I just don't live anymore. I have nothing in this world to live for other than myself and even then I don't care to do that anymore. nothing in my life will get better. 

I applied for HUD housing and was supposed to move into my own apartment after 7 years of waiting on the list for over 40 hud housing I got accepted to one but I couldn't make it there as I had no money to get there or for first months rent, downpayment, or to have the lights turned on. 

I spent the past ten years trying to better my life but only to get knocked down every time I get up. For example. saved 3 to 4 years up to 3k and bought my first car then got scammed by the dealership. Resaved money up to 900 dollars then needed two teeth pulled which cost 450 each after tax which drained my 900 I had saved last month after almost a year of saving. Then I got called up for my first apartment ever and couldn't get there. 

Two years ago needed eye surgery to remove a cataract in my right eye and now need it done in my left eye but the Dr refuses and now Texas is doing this Real ID stuff where you need a star on your driver license and in order to do that I need an eye exam and I will most likely fail it and lose my driver license because of the cataract in my left eye so there goes the driver license and there goes getting a car to live in. 

Spent years trying to get my GED only to fail it every time I try. spent the past eight years in the dating scene only to get rejected by women over my weight and told I am worthless and have nothing to offer a relationship or just downright mocked at and laughed at over my weight.

I got the cataracts in my eyes from taking Androgel testosterone medication because I have very low testosterone and I am on thyroid meds because my thyroid is basically dead and when they gave the max dose I lost 45 lbs in 8 months with absolutely no changes to my diet or daily routine but then gained it back a year later..

I just literally can't take anymore of this crummy life and to the point of thinking death is a lot better than this and it is better to be dead than keep failing or being knocked down every time I try to do something with my life. 

I also suffer from CPTSD = Complex post traumatic Stress Disorder. I didn't serve just from things I been through in my life and childhood. I also suffer from Severe chronic depression, Severe social anxiety, severe abandonment issues, paranoia and learning issues. I have been diagnosed with them all. 

I have looked up issues with autism and self diagnosing that I may be borderline autistic as I have some of the same issues in that spectrum.

,SuicideWatch," 

I had an open cosmetic rhinoplasty 4 months ago and since then I've been experiencing symptoms that have been fairly debilitating for me. A few weeks post-op I noticed that my air flow was different in each nostril and there was a slight pain in my left but I chalked it up to swelling.  

Now, 4 months later there is no more pain but I feel like there is a blockage in my left nostril and I can't sense airflow at all in either nostril which is keeping me up at night.  

I'm on sleeping pills which is barely helping me get a few hours throughout the night. I'm really scared and did not expect to go through this scary journey - all I wanted was a refinement. How would I know if I have empty nose syndrome or if I should wait longer to see if my issues are resolved naturally?

TW: drug use

September 9th Of 2018 was the worst day of my life, on that day my father had passed away unexpectedly from a blood clot in his lung that the doctors knew about but never put him on medication for. That day, my entire life had changed and since then I haven’t been able to recover. While yes I was depressed much before this and had been struggling with suicidal thoughts and tendencies since I was 8, my father death had made it all so much worse. I had started to get on anti-depressants, get counseling, and come out to my mother as trans not long after this because she had discovered I was trans. None of these treatments helped much until late November after I had attempted suicide and realized how cared for I was by family that had visited me in the hospital, then I really started to work hard for them to get better and to make sure I could get to the day when I could start hormone replacement therapy in about a year. Not long after that incident I traveled to New Mexico to visit family and my mom fell in love with a hole here and felt the need to reconnect with the family that lived there so she had decided to buy a home here and make my family move, which I can’t fully blame her for wanting to get out of the state we lived in (ny), it reminded her too much of my dad. When I first heard this news I was depressed about it but slowly become more accepting as I got much happier and healthier. I got to a point where I no longer felt the need for medication and cut back on therapy before moving to New Mexico, but those months of hard work all crashed when I got here. When I moved I had honestly lost everything I had known and have been stuck with a family of alcoholics who always start stupid drama over small things. I feel as if I can’t even do anything without someone starting shit about something I’ve done when I’m around them. But anyways soon enough I start school, I’m fairly excited about it but quickly that excitement dies out and is replaced with absolute misery. The school I currently go to refuses to let me use the mens bathroom and makes me use the women’s one because of my biological sex, keeps all of my accounts and name on the attendance as my birth name despite the fact I don’t identify with it, and dress coded me for piercings and dyed hair which they had never mentioned would be a problem when I went to register for the school not even a week before the school year started. So on my first day I get dress coded for things I was never warned about and told I had signed a paper that states I fully read through the dress code and agreed to comply with it (which I had actually gotten two weeks later during school hours). Bullshit, right? Well it gets worse. The only kid willing to talk to me was a drug addict who had done cocaine in front of me and offered me some, while high he almost choked himself to death and chucked a desk at the girls in front of us which was quite fucking terrifying. Almost a month after this event the same kid breaks my pencil sharpener and takes the blade part out of it, leaving the class shortly after to go to the bathroom. Of course I tell the teacher and she gets the counselor to get him, and he gets sent to a mental hospital for a week or so and transfers schools. So while yes, he may have been an absolute crackhead he was still the only friend I had so I was very bummed out and felt alone. Months pass and I feel more and more depressed as days go by, I start contemplating suicide once again and try to get my mom to get me a therapist (which she still hasn’t done). And of course on top of all of this kids at school find out I’m transgender and I’ve been getting dead named, picked on, and asked extremely personal questions  since then. Because of this discovery made by my classmates I’ve started to also gotten rape threats and death threats in which I feel there’s no point in reporting since the school cannot even comply by the laws and let me use the bathroom I feel comfortable in. Well I have started to make friends I still feel all alone and hopeless for things to get any better for my life, I’ve been trying so hard to get my life back into shape and actually gave loving here my best shot but I’ve failed myself and been failed by so many others, I see no point in continuing on since things keep getting worse and I’m not sure if I can hold on that much longer.

&lt;p&gt;September 9th Of 2018 was the worst day of my life, on that day my father had passed away unexpectedly from a blood clot in his lung that the doctors knew about but never put him on medication for. That day, my entire life had changed and since then I haven’t been able to recover. While yes I was depressed much before this and had been struggling with suicidal thoughts and tendencies since I was 8, my father death had made it all so much worse. I had started to get on anti-depressants, get counseling, and come out to my mother as trans not long after this because she had discovered I was trans. None of these treatments helped much until late November after I had attempted suicide and realized how cared for I was by family that had visited me in the hospital, then I really started to work hard for them to get better and to make sure I could get to the day when I could start hormone replacement therapy in about a year. Not long after that incident I traveled to New Mexico to visit family and my mom fell in love with a hole here and felt the need to reconnect with the family that lived there so she had decided to buy a home here and make my family move, which I can’t fully blame her for wanting to get out of the state we lived in (ny), it reminded her too much of my dad. When I first heard this news I was depressed about it but slowly become more accepting as I got much happier and healthier. I got to a point where I no longer felt the need for medication and cut back on therapy before moving to New Mexico, but those months of hard work all crashed when I got here. When I moved I had honestly lost everything I had known and have been stuck with a family of alcoholics who always start stupid drama over small things. I feel as if I can’t even do anything without someone starting shit about something I’ve done when I’m around them. But anyways soon enough I start school, I’m fairly excited about it but quickly that excitement dies out and is replaced with absolute misery. The school I currently go to refuses to let me use the mens bathroom and makes me use the women’s one because of my biological sex, keeps all of my accounts and name on the attendance as my birth name despite the fact I don’t identify with it, and dress coded me for piercings and dyed hair which they had never mentioned would be a problem when I went to register for the school not even a week before the school year started. So on my first day I get dress coded for things I was never warned about and told I had signed a paper that states I fully read through the dress code and agreed to comply with it (which I had actually gotten two weeks later during school hours). Bullshit, right? Well it gets worse. The only kid willing to talk to me was a drug addict who had done cocaine in front of me and offered me some, while high he almost choked himself to death and chucked a desk at the girls in front of us which was quite fucking terrifying. Almost a month after this event the same kid breaks my pencil sharpener and takes the blade part out of it, leaving the class shortly after to go to the bathroom. Of course I tell the teacher and she gets the counselor to get him, and he gets sent to a mental hospital for a week or so and transfers schools. So while yes, he may have been an absolute crackhead he was still the only friend I had so I was very bummed out and felt alone. Months pass and I feel more and more depressed as days go by, I start contemplating suicide once again and try to get my mom to get me a therapist (which she still hasn’t done). And of course on top of all of this kids at school find out I’m transgender and I’ve been getting dead named, picked on, and asked extremely personal questions  since then. Because of this discovery made by my classmates I’ve started to also gotten rape threats and death threats in which I feel there’s no point in reporting since the school cannot even comply by the laws and let me use the bathroom I feel comfortable in. Well I have started to make friends I still feel all alone and hopeless for things to get any better for my life, I’ve been trying so hard to get my life back into shape and actually gave loving here my best shot but I’ve failed myself and been failed by so many others, I see no point in continuing on since things keep getting worse and I’m not sure if I can hold on that much longer. The only reason I’m still here is because I know there’s people that care and I don’t want to put them through the same pain I went through when I lost my dad.&lt;/p&gt;

,SuicideWatch,"She was yelling at me about school stuff in the car. I usually stay calm and let her get it out of her system but today I snapped and told her that I’m suicidal, hoping that she’d calm down. She did not. She belittled me for it while I tried to keep myself from crying too much. I tried again, telling her that I want to kill myself and asking if that’s what she wants. Her immediate response was “You know what? Do what you fucking want.” 

I’m so tired. I’m sixteen, this isn’t normal. I defend her at every turn, even now in group chats with friends calling her abusive while I’m sleeping over at a friend’s house because the thought of returning home makes me feel like I’m gonna puke. 
I had a vivid image of my dead body covered in blood with a note saying that line of hers and a smiley face. I also want to see the look on her face when I walk up to her with a knife in my hand and tear my wrists open. I want to damage her as much as she’s damaged me. 

I’m not as depressed as I normally am, surprisingly. Just tired. She came by with a bag of extra clothes for me and I think she found an empty pack of cigarettes in my closet because she took a shirt of mine that was under it (I hide it between layers). My friend went out to get it for me because thinking about talking to her face to face made me anxious. She blamed him, to his face, for me wanting to switch schools; that he scared me out of my current program. 

I’m not actually going to kill myself or anything, as much as I want to. It’s too short notice for me to make any final preparations. But I think if I hadn’t called my friend I’d have broken my self harm clean streak and cut down to the dermis again or maybe even deeper. 

The icing on the cake for all this is that I got called selfish by my mom for not coming home. Her boyfriend’s mother passed away recently (we live with him) and her funeral is tomorrow. I have selfish timing apparently, and I’m not even the one who started this whole thing in the first place. I’ve cried so much that I don’t feel any strong emotions anymore. All I have right now is sadness, but it almost fades into me being tired. 

I also have guilt. Not because of this but because I have an important group project due tomorrow and I was supposed to make a poster. I obviously wasn’t able to complete it. People’s grades are going to suffer because I’m too weak to just walk inside the appartment and sit through some yelling     

I just don’t deserve to live, I guess. I’m a massive letdown to everyone in one way or another. People would be much happier with me gone, my parents are divorced and though my dad would be upset about losing me at least he won’t have to put up with my melodrama anymore. My mom won’t have to stress herself out over me being too tired to put effort into school, there wouldn’t be any strain on her relationship with her boyfriend anymore because of me. My classmates won’t have to worry about bad grades because of a flakey group member. My boyfriend can get someone who won’t ruin his mood all the time just by talking about their feelings. My family doesn’t have to worry about me being a disgrace or anything, if a member dies by suicide they’ll likely just get pity rather than dirty looks after I inevitably become a junkie. 

The only one I would really feel bad for is my dog. I don’t see him often, every few months or so. But he loves me about as much as I love him. I don’t know how I could ever explain to him, in a way that he’ll understand, why I’m leaving and not coming back. Why it’s not his fault, the extent of how much I love him, how good of a boy he is. That’s just something I’ll never be able to do for him. 

Vent over. I need to get some sleep but I don’t think I’ll be able to get up in the morning. 

If it’s any consolation, to those that have read this far, I’m seeing my psychologist tomorrow.",t2_4mdt2rhs,False,,0,False,My mom told me to kill myself,[],r/SuicideWatch,False,0,,0,False,t3_fe4x5d,False,dark,,public,3,0,{},,False,[],,False,False,,{},,False,3,,False,,False,,[],{},,True,,1583482730.0,text,0,,,text,self.SuicideWatch,False,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;She was yelling at me about school stuff in the car. I usually stay calm and let her get it out of her system but today I snapped and told her that I’m suicidal, hoping that she’d calm down. She did not. She belittled me for it while I tried to keep myself from crying too much. I tried again, telling her that I want to kill myself and asking if that’s what she wants. Her immediate response was “You know what? Do what you fucking want.” &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m so tired. I’m sixteen, this isn’t normal. I defend her at every turn, even now in group chats with friends calling her abusive while I’m sleeping over at a friend’s house because the thought of returning home makes me feel like I’m gonna puke. 
I had a vivid image of my dead body covered in blood with a note saying that line of hers and a smiley face. I also want to see the look on her face when I walk up to her with a knife in my hand and tear my wrists open. I want to damage her as much as she’s damaged me. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m not as depressed as I normally am, surprisingly. Just tired. She came by with a bag of extra clothes for me and I think she found an empty pack of cigarettes in my closet because she took a shirt of mine that was under it (I hide it between layers). My friend went out to get it for me because thinking about talking to her face to face made me anxious. She blamed him, to his face, for me wanting to switch schools; that he scared me out of my current program. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m not actually going to kill myself or anything, as much as I want to. It’s too short notice for me to make any final preparations. But I think if I hadn’t called my friend I’d have broken my self harm clean streak and cut down to the dermis again or maybe even deeper. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The icing on the cake for all this is that I got called selfish by my mom for not coming home. Her boyfriend’s mother passed away recently (we live with him) and her funeral is tomorrow. I have selfish timing apparently, and I’m not even the one who started this whole thing in the first place. I’ve cried so much that I don’t feel any strong emotions anymore. All I have right now is sadness, but it almost fades into me being tired. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also have guilt. Not because of this but because I have an important group project due tomorrow and I was supposed to make a poster. I obviously wasn’t able to complete it. People’s grades are going to suffer because I’m too weak to just walk inside the appartment and sit through some yelling     &lt;/p&gt;

,SuicideWatch,"The summer of 2019 I started developing severe OCD after suffering from mild, unnoticeable OCD for many years. I just feel so tired of things, so bored of living, but I can't commit suicide.

I know that there are people who care about about me, like my parents, and the shit they would have to go trough if I commited suicide is unbearable for me to imagine.

,SuicideWatch,"I generally steer clear of making posts of this nature since I don't like discussing my personal life on social media. That said, this is something that I feel I must be open about in order to come to terms with it. To contextualise, I'm a 16 year old girl and I'm originally from Eastern Europe, but I now live in the UK. This may be a very long read and I'll be sure to TL;DR.

I was diagnosed with autism at the age of 4. I'm not 'low functioning' (for lack of a better term; feel free to suggest one) per se, but to other people, it's pretty obvious that I am developmentally disabled. I have poor fine motor skills, struggle to articulate my thoughts and am extremely susceptible to meltdowns when not on birth control (I'll explain this later).

For most of my early childhood this was largely not a huge issue in my life. I received good support and people were usually empathetic towards my struggles. However, things started to go slowly and then eventually very dramatically downhill once I got my period age 10.

My parents noticed that I had menstrual cycles that were on average around 21 days in length. Initially, they weren't too worried and assumed they would eventually become more regular as time went on. They didn't. They became shorter, and when I last calculated them, my cycles lasted 18 days on average. This messed up my hormones and I became extremely depressed. This depression peaked around my period. I don't mean that I got typical premenstrual symptoms; in the days leading up to my period, I would self harm, have suicidal thoughts, experience very violent and dramatic mood swings, become extremely sensitive to sound and texture and lose interest in my hobbies and friends. I suggested possibly having PMDD but this idea was dismissed by my parents and doctors.

I first attempted suicide when I was either 13 or 14 (but definitely no older). I didn't inform my parents of this, but only because I didn't want to upset them or make them feel like they had failed me as parents, because they definitely didn't. I then attempted once more aged 15.

During this time period I was prescribed the combined oral contraceptive pill. Theoretically, I am supposed to 'tricycle' them, or in other words, take three months' worth of packs and then take a break. I did this until the second most recent attempt in October of last year. This was the first one that I told anybody about and you may not be shocked to hear that it happened whilst I was on a 'period break'. I went to A&amp;E the next day, where I waited for seven hours before being seen by a therapist for twenty minutes who told me that I seemed to have things 'under control' and took no action except refer me to another therapist, who I had one appointment with where I heard the same thing. It was my mother's birthday that day and I have not forgiven myself for making her spend it in A&amp;E. She stayed mostly collected throughout it all but I could tell she felt very upset and shaken. Since this, I have stopped taking breaks and now do not have periods at all. This is massively helpful but my situation is still not great.

It's partly for that reason that I didn't inform her of my most recent attempt in December. It was also because I was due to fly to Canada the day after the attempt and couldn't bring myself to jeopardise the trip. I considered calling a suicide hotline once I was in Montreal but ended up not doing it, mainly because when I looked up numbers to call, I couldn't find one in Quebec that offered English counselling, but also because my mother discouraged it because of what we would be charged (please remember, she didn't know that I had attempted suicide).

I'm in Year 11, which in the UK is the final year of high school. I'm currently caught up in revising for my GCSEs, which I'm doing OK with from an academic perspective, but struggling to cope with mentally. I'm also being bullied; less than in previous years but still in a way that fucks me up even though I pretend it doesn't. I used to be targeted for my personality and mannerisms, which I've given up being upset about since I've accepted that I don't carry myself typically. Recently, though, they've shifted to targeting my appearance.

This may make me sound shallow, but as a 16 year old girl, having my appearance mocked and scorned is completely crushing. A few months ago it was never something I gave much thought and I never felt insecure about my appearance outside of typical concerns teenage girls have. People call me 'ugly' and laugh at me to my face. I've never been in a relationship of any kind and, at the risk of sounding like an incel, this does not give me hope for the future and makes me question if I am physically attractive to anybody. It makes me feel arrogant for having ever thought that there was nothing wrong with the way I look. And I'm starting to spiral emotionally because of it. 15 year old me would have laughed at the idea of me being so insecure about my physical appearance, but for me, it was one of the few things I had genuine confidence and pride in and now it is being taken from me.

I feel very shallow and fragile for feeling this way. I'm 16 and have four attempts to my name and it's embarrassing. I hate that I'll never really be able to disassociate myself from that because this isn't what I want to look back on in 10 or 20 years time.

TL;DR I'm a 16 year old autistic girl who has attempted suicide 4 times and is now reconsidering due to bullying concerning my physical appearance.",t2_wvk7d,False,,0,False,[TW] I am 16 and have attempted suicide 4 times; bullying about my appearance is making me consider it again,[],r/SuicideWatch,False,0,,0,False,t3_fe2odz,False,dark,,public,2,0,{},,False,[],,False,False,,{},,False,2,,False,,1583445987.0,,[],{},,True,,1583473405.0,text,0,,,text,self.SuicideWatch,False,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;I generally steer clear of making posts of this nature since I don&amp;#39;t like discussing my personal life on social media. That said, this is something that I feel I must be open about in order to come to terms with it. To contextualise, I&amp;#39;m a 16 year old girl and I&amp;#39;m originally from Eastern Europe, but I now live in the UK. This may be a very long read and I&amp;#39;ll be sure to TL;DR.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was diagnosed with autism at the age of 4. I&amp;#39;m not &amp;#39;low functioning&amp;#39; (for lack of a better term; feel free to suggest one) per se, but to other people, it&amp;#39;s pretty obvious that I am developmentally disabled. I have poor fine motor skills, struggle to articulate my thoughts and am extremely susceptible to meltdowns when not on birth control (I&amp;#39;ll explain this later).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For most of my early childhood this was largely not a huge issue in my life. I received good support and people were usually empathetic towards my struggles. However, things started to go slowly and then eventually very dramatically downhill once I got my period age 10.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My parents noticed that I had menstrual cycles that were on average around 21 days in length. Initially, they weren&amp;#39;t too worried and assumed they would eventually become more regular as time went on. They didn&amp;#39;t. They became shorter, and when I last calculated them, my cycles lasted 18 days on average. This messed up my hormones and I became extremely depressed. This depression peaked around my period. I don&amp;#39;t mean that I got typical premenstrual symptoms; in the days leading up to my period, I would self harm, have suicidal thoughts, experience very violent and dramatic mood swings, become extremely sensitive to sound and texture and lose interest in my hobbies and friends. I suggested possibly having PMDD but this idea was dismissed by my parents and doctors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I first attempted suicide when I was either 13 or 14 (but definitely no older). I didn&amp;#39;t inform my parents of this, but only because I didn&amp;#39;t want to upset them or make them feel like they had failed me as parents, because they definitely didn&amp;#39;t. I then attempted once more aged 15.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During this time period I was prescribed the combined oral contraceptive pill. Theoretically, I am supposed to &amp;#39;tricycle&amp;#39; them, or in other words, take three months&amp;#39; worth of packs and then take a break. I did this until the second most recent attempt in October of last year. This was the first one that I told anybody about and you may not be shocked to hear that it happened whilst I was on a &amp;#39;period break&amp;#39;. I went to A&amp;amp;E the next day, where I waited for seven hours before being seen by a therapist for twenty minutes who told me that I seemed to have things &amp;#39;under control&amp;#39; and took no action except refer me to another therapist, who I had one appointment with where I heard the same thing.

,SuicideWatch,"I think about suicide most days. When I visit my 92yr old grandmother in her care home I wish I could be there, waiting to die - how peaceful it must be to know you will be released from all this suffering very soon? 

I consider myself a spiritual person and have been heavily into yoga, meditation and psychedelics and learnt about Buddhist philosophy which is what has formed my beliefs about death. Most people find this a healing path but for me the transcendental experiences I have had have felt like such a homecoming that I haven’t wanted to return to reality. I have never felt at home in myself and often feel like I desperately want to “get out of my body” in which I feel trapped. I have always felt I was born into the wrong body/life. I’ve also believed from a young age that I will die from suicide or a reckless accident. I unsuccessfully attempted age 25 and have had some other near misses. 

The thing I am struggling with is I believe that if I kill myself my soul will return back to the source but I am worried it will be turned around and put right back into another life of equal amount of suffering to mine as my soul won’t have evolved at all. I don’t think I can escape it unless I evolve by overcoming my struggles. I’ve had an eating disorder for 17yrs, as well as BPD and Bipolar. I guess this is the cycle of Samsara and the continual dukkha/suffering which is part of the human condition. 

When I think about this it makes me feel trapped and is going some way to put me off the idea of suicide, but at the same time I feel like I’ve exhausted my energy to try and overcome it all in this life - I’m exhausted in my battle against this ED, it feels completely hopeless.

I know Im not the only one with this type of story but I need to share. At 50 years old I have alot going, full time musician and always busy. In other words my life is very good but I feel finished. I&amp;#39;m tired and still suffer from depression. I don&amp;#39;t drink or do drugs. I work out almost every day, have had therapy and cannot shake what goes on in my head. I didn&amp;#39;t kill myself because of our 23 year old son otherwise I would&amp;#39;ve been gone long ago. If anybody reads this I&amp;#39;m just sharing my thoughts and I too go through life not wanting to be here. Honestly the worlds a pretty shitty place to be but there is alot of good out there somewhere.&lt;/p&gt;

Hello everyone here :) 
I’m a 16 year old female. I’m not feeling too well right now. I’m getting these thoughts and suicidal feeling again. They come back occasionally. Right now, I’m eating with my beautiful mother, laughing with my dad as he says my mother is a wonderful cook. I broke down last night when I finished reviewing and studying from my classes. I studied hard for a test I had today, and I felt good about it! Right now, I’m eating as I type this. This day? I thought it would be bad, but it was okay, turning to bad. I’m In a relationship. I love this boy so much. I’ve been happiest with him since years ago. Im a sophomore in high school by the way. I’ve trusted my boyfriend so much and he’s always been there for me. Today however, I felt something was wrong. He didn’t really speak with me. But it’s okay, I’m probably just overthinking it, I want nothing but pure happiness for him. Whether he finds it with someone else or me. I’ve always helped others, always had a smile on my face and I’ve always wanted nothing but happiness for everyone. I’ve only want happiness for everyone else. I want them to feel good and appreciated by atleast someone when they do something. I’ve always supported through anything and I’ve never judged. I’ve been kind to everyone. I appreciate everything that’s given to me, but it’s been a few months I’ve been feeling these usual suicide thoughts. They come often. It’s been a year since I’ve been like this, trying to hang on and move on from it. Whether I see happy moments, times where I love this view. Or others where I’m not sure how I’m feeling.

I felt pressured by my mother. Verbally. I hate trying so hard at school, and failing. What’s the point? I’m going to fail anyways. I’ve always done my best in everything and I’ve always tried to stay happy and look the positive way. But I can’t anymore. I’ve always thought, what if I can just end it? Would anyone really miss me? I think about it, imagining my parents. But, would I really make a difference? Will I go to hell? Religiously talking, I love god. But I’m sorry, I feel like I’ve lost faith in myself. I don’t see it anymore. And every night, I pray, to have a good day, to see my parents, my friends. To stay safe. I want to die, but I don’t. But I want to attempt, but I’m afraid. What if I fail? Would my family be ashamed? 

I think about it daily, and I feel like the only reason I’m
here is for my love. To be there for him when he needs company, to be there for him when he can’t find the light, to be with him when he can’t be happy. To support him through the good and bad. No matter what, no matter the past. For my dad, who’s worked really hard every single night for me and my family. For my friend, who needs support from his friends and family. For my dog, who always listened to me when I felt alone, knowing he wouldn’t understand, but knows I’m upset and let’s me cry on him when I don’t have anyone else.

I’ll never get to love him again. I did such a bad thing. He’ll never care for me. I need to die. I know everyone will convince me no. But I do. I can’t move on. I can’t forgive myself. This is the person I love with all of my heart. I would do anything for him. I ruined my one chance with him. I ruined it! We can’t be together. I miss him so much. There’s no end to how this hurts. Finally I understand that I deserve it. I don’t want to stop myself anymore. I can’t talk to my friends. They’re so sick of it. I talked to them millions of times. I talk about this every day. I can’t move on. There’s nothing anyone can say. I’m as bad as he said. I’m everything he said I was. I’m an abuser. I never understood it before. I abused him! How could I have done that? How could I not have seen it? How could I not have begged for forgiveness? I hurt him so bad. He wanted to kill himself, it hurt him so bad. I deserve it! To feel like this! I can’t forgive myself. I can’t solve this. I can’t get what I want out of this. He’s so far moved on. It’s over, it’s done, I can’t get over it. I want him back so badly. I miss him so much. I’m always going to hurt like this. I’m already in hell&lt;/p&gt;

I've been married and divorced 3 times and several LTRs over the years, including the one I'm in now (over a year and we live together). I've got 5 kids, one just turned 13 last week. She wants nothing to do with me, nor does 2 of her half-sisters, who aren't even nearby (I called DFCS after we split because there were (literally hundreds) of roaches in the apartment in which we lived and she would so nothing about, among other things (like the time her autistic son found her loaded, insecure handgun), but those details are just stuff since I'm now a pariah. 100% would call again. So anyway, no contact with the youngest 3.

But what I'm really struggling with is, ""Why not?""

I know all of the typical reasons involving everyone else, that they'll be hurt, it will affect them horribly, etc. But what about me? Why not? My girlfriend really doesn't like me tbh. (she said I'm the rudest person she's ever met and I believe she means it, even though I've never been told that I was a rude person in 50 years.

But for me, aside from how it affects others, why the hell not? I have no religious faith, because I just don't. If you take away how it affects others, I just don't see a reason to keep living anymore. My job sucks, my girlfriend doesn't even really like me apparently, and I see my parents once a year for 2 days or so and my only brother I haven't seen in 7 tmyears even though we get along.

My hearing sucks, I'm constantly having to ask people to repeat themselves and that frustrates all involved. And even when I don't, I have really loud tinnitus. Neuropathy, ADHD, constant joint pain (not debilitating but always there), frequent memory loss (my gf had to show me pictures of our 3rd date at a steak place because I didn't remember it all and that's not uncommon).

So, why? My current relationship is probably ending soon anyway. For me, what's the point? I don't want to hear about how it affects others because that just adds more guilt to what's already been a pretty shitty life and kinda makes me want to stop that guilt too because I wouldn't have to feel it. I know it's selfish and suicide is indeed probably the most selfish thing I can do. I get that.

But why oh why should *I* want to keep on living when my whole adult life has been a cycle of misery and promises to be more of the same.

It doesn’t matter what I’ll be doing I just rather be dead all the time so I don’t have to do anything? Maybe I’m lazy or something but I just hate doing stuff? I rather just be dead lol, so I can just be in peace.. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m on antidepressants and they help but I still don’t enjoy life, there’s more why I don’t enjoy life mostly cause I can’t hold a job, or keep any friends or even talk to anyone. I just feel like a fucking ghost.&lt;/p&gt;

,SuicideWatch,"Hey. After much meditation, I decided to create this post, both as therapy for myself and to open up a forum of conversation. I am writing this right before I go to work, so I will probably edit it later. So here it goes. I apologize in advance for my rambling. 

I am currently 20 years old and a sophomore  in college. A few minutes ago I typed in “I’m eventually going to kill myself” into google trying to find some forum post to read. Lo and behold an r/suicidewatch post came up from 3 years ago, which led to me creating my reddit account to make this post.

Throughout my life so far, I have struggled from a crippling loneliness. I was mostly a loner in middle school and high school, one of those arrogant assholes who only care about grades, etc. Inside, however, I had a crippling insecurity about my body image. I have a distinct memory from when I was perhaps 10-11 of staring into the mirror and looking at my face, critiquing every last bit. To those I know, this would not make much sense as I have always been told that I am very attractive. I have never seen it, however. My phone, to this day, is filled with photos that I have taken of myself. 

Deep down, I think that my depression is mostly of a natural physiological basis. Up until I was 18 I had never even held a girl’s hand and up to now I have only kissed one (a very pretty Italian girl who left the country soon after). I have spent most of the last 2 years listening to sad songs, driving aimlessly, chain smoking, and watching movies like Her and Manchester by the Sea. Luckily enough, I do have a best friend that I met in HS who struggles with depression as well. He however, has no problem picking up girls do to his charisma that he has developed over the years as a coping mechanism. Together, we mostly drink, smoke weed, and watch “films.” I always make it a point to get drunk or high enough that my entire life, past and future, flashes before me in a sort of slideshow. 

As I write this, I have been using steroids on and off for 2.5 years. I first started after losing 25 pounds (mostly by starving myself) and then developing an ok physique. I thought that nothing else would make me attractive so I made the decision to buy Testosterone Enanthate off the darknet when I was 17. I didn’t give a shit if I died because, in my mind, there was no other way to find a girl to fill the void inside of me. Now, I am very muscular (5’10’’, 190, around 10% bf), yet my void is not filled and I don’t think it ever will be. 
I am on a solid trajectory right now and will inherit a large sum from my grandfather when I turn 25. This adds no meaning to my life, however. I see myself as a sort of Holden Caulfield or Amory Blaine (from this side of paradise). All I want to do is help people and be loved, but I have a crippling fear that I will only feel loved vicariously, by watching movies and reading books. I can’t shake the feeling that I won’t make it past 40 before I eventually kill myself. My father is currently slowly dying of alcoholism from his depression at 50 just as his father did.

Every time I think of this I am taken back to a memory from when I was a senior in HS. I had been talking to a girl for a month or two and my best friend had hid the fact that he was having sex with her. I had never felt so inadequate in my life. I drove home crying and tied my belt around the doorknob and leaned forward. Thankfully I didn’t follow through with it. This inadequacy still consumes me.

,SuicideWatch,"Don't mind the grammar. I'm Dutch.

**Don't read if you are easily triggered. I don't want any of you feel bad/worse.**

Okay, some of you already start typing reasons to stay alive. Y'all are so kind for doing that. I miss kind people. Everyone leaves me 'cuz I'm depressed. And everytime I'm in my deepest point of a 'depression wave', somebody dies. Like life also tries to convince me I should kill myself.

So I heard in August I could go to a mental hospital in MARCH. So at that point it sounded so far away that I gave up and neglected myself. Cuz everyday was hell. And I was supposed to wait 6 months. **But** of course I was thankfull my psychiatrist got me on the list of the mental hospital that is specialised in autism. So I was too scared to really tell I wouldn't survive until then.

I've been severe depressed in october. Didn't really come out of my room except for diner or to go to the toilet. Selfharmed the whole day long, slept when I was tired, not on a certain time so my sleep rythm was ruined. Gained weight. Couldn't concentrate on anything. Like I was in my mind already fading away. I became sure life was giving my signs that I should die. Everything that could go wrong, DID go wrong. And in my deepest point, my grandma died. I still haven't accept it. Her death didn't feel real for days. It was on the funeral where it felt like life punched me in the head. The amount of emotions were so much that I tried to not be in the reality anymore. Thinking about an alternate life. Writing stories and imagining me in it constantly.

I think that last thing gave me a depersonalisation disorder or something. I don't know how it works and I know I can't diagnose myself. But on moments where I have a lot of emotions or when I'm a little stressed, I feel like I'm watching my body experiencing things. Like I'm the coördinator in my head watching through my eyes. I can't really talk or think cuz I feel like my body should talk or think in that situation. I'm just watching what happens and take decisions.

And then late October... I was standing on the edge of the bridge and decided to talk to an old friend, instead of jumping at that moment. (She has DID, and one of her personalities is an agressive one who made me dissociate when she wanted me to kms). You can say she's a bad influence, but she's the only one still standing by me and the only one with the same kind of humor. She has help so the thing that happened last year won't happen again.

Anyway, I became a little happier, started enjoying going outside again. I made friends in a therian community cuz I figured back in August I was a therian too. (whatever your opinion is about 'therians', pls dont post them here cuz this isnt what the post is about)

Idk why, but I knew I was going into a depressed moment again, as I was irritated everyday and selfharming again.... So I landed in the depressed wave again. Or should I say drowning? I don't enjoy anything, every food tastes boring. I can't sleep cuz I cry every damn night. I'm constantly thinking about kms. I'm even trying it, or sort of searching boundaries. Taking pills but just enough to still stay alive. Or standing on the edge of the bridge but not jump.

What triggered my to write this post, was because I heard a cat of mine has cancer and he may not survive another week. The cat that shoved his fur in my face :') so I got a little distracted in a traumatising situation which happened 2/3 years ago. (Can't talk about it now cuz PTSD flashbacks will kill me with this amount of emotions I have now) The cat that walks over my legs, jumps in my neck and demands attention when I'm crying on the floor in the middle of the night. He is like my ESA (not official one) And I'm about to lose him. I can't go through this. I can't lose the last string of the rope that I'm holding on the edge of a ravine. I feel like kms at the moment. I don't wanna die. I wanna be of this pain.

About the mental hospital in march? 18 days until an apointment to talk about practical stuff. then I have to wait another week (I guess?) to finally be there and be save from myself.

I&amp;#39;m Dutch.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Don&amp;#39;t read if you are easily triggered. I don&amp;#39;t want any of you feel bad/worse.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Okay, some of you already start typing reasons to stay alive. Y&amp;#39;all are so kind for doing that. I miss kind people. Everyone leaves me &amp;#39;cuz I&amp;#39;m depressed. And everytime I&amp;#39;m in my deepest point of a &amp;#39;depression wave&amp;#39;, somebody dies. Like life also tries to convince me I should kill myself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So I heard in August I could go to a mental hospital in MARCH. So at that point it sounded so far away that I gave up and neglected myself. Cuz everyday was hell. And I was supposed to wait 6 months. &lt;strong&gt;But&lt;/strong&gt; of course I was thankfull my psychiatrist got me on the list of the mental hospital that is specialised in autism. So I was too scared to really tell I wouldn&amp;#39;t survive until then.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve been severe depressed in october. Didn&amp;#39;t really come out of my room except for diner or to go to the toilet. Selfharmed the whole day long, slept when I was tired, not on a certain time so my sleep rythm was ruined. Gained weight. Couldn&amp;#39;t concentrate on anything. Like I was in my mind already fading away. I became sure life was giving my signs that I should die. Everything that could go wrong, DID go wrong. And in my deepest point, my grandma died. I still haven&amp;#39;t accept it. Her death didn&amp;#39;t feel real for days. It was on the funeral where it felt like life punched me in the head. The amount of emotions were so much that I tried to not be in the reality anymore. Thinking about an alternate life. Writing stories and imagining me in it constantly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think that last thing gave me a depersonalisation disorder or something. I don&amp;#39;t know how it works and I know I can&amp;#39;t diagnose myself. But on moments where I have a lot of emotions or when I&amp;#39;m a little stressed, I feel like I&amp;#39;m watching my body experiencing things. Like I&amp;#39;m the coördinator in my head watching through my eyes. I can&amp;#39;t really talk or think cuz I feel like my body should talk or think in that situation. I&amp;#39;m just watching what happens and take decisions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And then late October... I was standing on the edge of the bridge and decided to talk to an old friend, instead of jumping at that moment. (She has DID, and one of her personalities is an agressive one who made me dissociate when she wanted me to kms). You can say she&amp;#39;s a bad influence, but she&amp;#39;s the only one still standing by me and the only one with the same kind of humor. She has help so the thing that happened last year won&amp;#39;t happen again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyway, I became a little happier, started enjoying going outside again. I made friends in a therian community cuz I figured back in August I was a therian too. (whatever your opinion is about &amp;#39;therians&amp;#39;, pls dont post them here cuz this isnt what the post is about)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Idk why, but I knew I was going into a depressed moment again, as I was irritated everyday and selfharming again.... So I landed in the depressed wave again. Or should I say drowning? I don&amp;#39;t enjoy anything, every food tastes boring. I can&amp;#39;t sleep cuz I cry every damn night. I&amp;#39;m constantly thinking about kms. I&amp;#39;m even trying it, or sort of searching boundaries. Taking pills but just enough to still stay alive. Or standing on the edge of the bridge but not jump.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What triggered my to write this post, was because I heard a cat of mine has cancer and he may not survive another week. The cat that shoved his fur in my face :&amp;#39;) so I got a little distracted in a traumatising situation which happened 2/3 years ago. (Can&amp;#39;t talk about it now cuz PTSD flashbacks will kill me with this amount of emotions I have now) The cat that walks over my legs, jumps in my neck and demands attention when I&amp;#39;m crying on the floor in the middle of the night. He is like my ESA (not official one) And I&amp;#39;m about to lose him. I can&amp;#39;t go through this. I can&amp;#39;t lose the last string of the rope that I&amp;#39;m holding on the edge of a ravine. I feel like kms at the moment. I don&amp;#39;t wanna die. I wanna be of this pain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;About the mental hospital in march? 18 days until an apointment to talk about practical stuff. then I have to wait another week (I guess?) to finally be there and be save from myself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But plz give me some strenght, some advice. I know I need to hold on these last weeks, but I can&amp;#39;t. Every minute of everyday is torture. I don&amp;#39;t think I&amp;#39;ll survive until then.&lt;/p&gt;

I am not in college and am unemployed and looking for a job. I've been looking for months, but I live in an isolated area and don't know how to drive so my options are nonexistant. 

When I was in school, I was active in theater and would ask my closest friends to come to my performances, and they had no desire to support me, even though they knew how much it meant to me, even though I offered to arrange a ride for them and pay for their tickets.

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m looking for little things such as &amp;quot;some beds are very comfortable,&amp;quot; because &amp;quot;things will get better&amp;quot; is the stupidest BS I never want to hear again. Therapy/social workers are also just normal people anyways so don&amp;#39;t tell me there&amp;#39;s help either. Or share a funny joke. I once called crisis line for a funny joke the lady was like &amp;quot;wat? wat? do you want to tell me ur problems?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hell no. If I talk about my problems I&amp;#39;ll just be reminded of them again and get even sadder than I originally needed to me. It makes the problems seem worse than they are.&lt;/p&gt;

,SuicideWatch,"I'm writing this because I've just once again thought about killing myself but this isn’t even within the first 100 times I have thought of suicide from a young age I’d say roughly around age 11-12 I first thought of just ending it I even remember how I sat at a window ledge looked down and just bathed in the moment before climbing back down with tears coming down my face because I wasn’t strong enough to. 

Wow… well I bet that sounded crazy I wasn’t strong enough to kill myself a direct contradiction of what strength is but a las I and any other who has felt how I feel will relate. 

So about me, of course you must be wondering how did he get this fucked up what has happened. Well im going to let you all know just in case once day I do get my strength. I am one of 10 children slotting in at number 7, I have been emotionally and physically abused by those who were supposed to nourish me. Here’s whats different though so not only did they make my life hell they controlled my life where I was and what I was doing to the extent that I couldn’t even make my own decisions on the little things and still cant. 

Thing’s I have been beaten for just so you get the vibe

·  As a child I would pee in my sleep so I would be woken up by a belt hitting my body

·  As all kids do I would fall asleep on the sofa watching tv, so I would be woken up with a belt hitting my body

·  I once told my dad there was no point in doing something AGAIN because nothing was good enough for him… to which I was beaten with a metal pole until I could no longer use my arms to defend my self and just took blows to the head dripping blood all over the house.

**To summarise I have been fucked up.**

But im trying to figure out how and when this all started at what point did I become the person I am now (Afraid ,insecure ,manipulative and untrustworthy). I give myself these attributes because that’s all I really am. I am afraid of the world horrified possibly I have ran out of classes (IN FUCKING UNI) because I felt as if everyone was looking on me I have this crippling feeling that everyone is always looking at me. Insecure lol I don’t even know what to say I have deleted everything on my social media’s multiple times purely because the anxiety of someone giving a fuck enough to look at them and then the possibility of them finding my pictures funny gives me so much anxiety that I’d prefer them not be there. Am I manipulative yes, but I don’t understand how one can not be manipulative. I like to have things my way of course we all do but I know how to get it done I know how to get responses out of people or to get people to do what I want because I had to learn to. I'm one of fucking 10 children and I showed up in the middle and this wasn’t no brady bunch happy family shit this was controlling, abusive and manipulative and I guess that’s what I became, you are a product of your environment after all. I don’t really know the purpose or direction of this as I have just stopped crying again (its 2:13pm) and decided fuck it imma do this so if I do kms at least maybe one mf’er can know what I been trying to say.

So guys I think im going crazy this is a new development if you don’t mind me starting here, I sit in my room and talk to myself inside my head for hours a day full on conversations (guess this is what happens when you don’t get to train social skills). Sometime’s I cry sometimes I get so angry I don’t even know what to do and sometimes admittedly I feel straight up heart broken as if I have been done a disservice by the world and unfairly I was born into one family instead of another. I fantasize too much and I kind of sorta relate to people from Netflix series. Like Joe the stalker I get it bro you just want to feel a solid love that aint going no where and youll do anything to keep that but in turn you require a few things loyalty being one of them. Fortunately I can say I don’t relate to him with his killing (that would just be another burden in my head to drive me crazier) instead when my heart is broken people just kick the pieces to side and move on. 

Fuuuuuuck im really not good at structuring things I write.

Ok I think the logical thing to do is start with little stories from childhood and work my way to present day. 

I was born in 1998 in Africa and moved to the United Kingdom at a young age not sure how young because I don’t remember. My dad had been previously married and had 5 children from his first wife and at this time only 3 from my mum me and my 2 brothers one a year older one a year younger. It’s said that when I was born they thought I was a fucked up baby, I was going to be disabled or something of the sorts (not in a doctor said it way, but like I was born and they looked at me and said na this aint it way and little would you know my little brother was born just under 10 months later) Fantastic way to start life. So we all lived in one house when we first got to the UK (very vague memory of this shit by the way combination of what I've been told as fact and what I know to be true) So as a kid I have been described as a quiet and timid kid so quiet infact that my older brother and sister (age 12-14) (from a different mother) would pinch me or hit me to make me cry because when I would cry it was funny that I would make no noise.  I was also a huge fan of lion king asking them to watch it multiple times a day with me, everyday. We then moved a couple times memory all blurry and we arrived at the next destination that I remember. We lived in a flat in a small town in England for a couple years, my memories of this place are my   constantly injuring himself severly by playing out, dbz, Toonami, vegeta and ps2. I was a normal kid but I would get fucked up by my dad. (btw im around 4-6 years old) I still remember the time I was called downstairs just to be beaten I think for drawing a rude picture that was discovered after I had just been beaten. Boom boom not too much going on just the entrance to a life of suffering but not too much tbh.  


We then moved to a council house elsewhere just kids and mum because dad had decided its stressful to live with people so he’d rather pay 1k+ rent elsewhere for his own place then help his family. These years weren’t too bad though if anything they were my favourite because he wasn’t around it was just us 3 years in that place from year 2- year 5. He would still drive down though on occasion just to hit us and then return to his home on the flip side of the uk. This was fantastic for my personal growth of course as I learnt that being a father means coming over shouting and arguing with your wife, beating your children and then cutting. And by beating I mean sure we were between ages 7/8-10 but he would hit us with all he had leave belt marks for days all over my body. To the extent the neighbour’s would hear us screaming and would then mock us the next day as we walked to school. He then thought that we were becoming bad children (at the time me and all my siblings were top in our classes thanks to our mum keeping us up to study with her , as well as this at this age we started being forced to go to mosque mon- fri (5-7) and then over the weekends we would go to Arabic school and if we were at home we would play outside in the park so I don’t know how bad we could of really been but who knows.(she was in college so while she did her homework she helped us with ours)). Actually with that being said I would steal from my mum not a lot and not everyday but a pound or 2 here and there just because everyone else in school could afford to buy things like sweets and toys and I would never be able to join in because I had none. I would come home from school and mums not in so id have to sit outside the house for a couple hours people would walk by but I had no friends house to go to like my brothers so I would just sit at the door and wait. My life has been hell maybe its easy from an outside view to say naa aint that bad but try live it everyday you come home aint no body even in, by the time everyone does get in its all at once no time for you and mum to talk no dad asking how was school bruh go to  sleep. To summarize though I was studying everyday 7 days a week and still being beaten along with my brothers but I had a newly born sister and it was time for the move to the big city so fuck it maybe its about to get better.Bruh I forgot and now remembered this nigga would look all 3 of us in the garage for whole days just because and the punishment for leaving would be you get beat and thrown back in there. Think about the mentally how much that would fuck you up you aint even fucking 10 yet.

When we first got to this new city we were quick to discover its rough out there day one we were robbed. They were no more parks we could just go to play at so now I became and indoors kid. To go along with that now my dad didn’t live too far away he was only in the neighbouring town so instead of monthly “visits” it was now weekly. Fair enough to say within a year I had put on I don’t know 10 maybe 15kg I was fat af going into year 7 but in year 6 I was a very thin framed kid. I was depressed and I'm not sure if I knew it but my life consisted of go to school and be bullied to come home and be beaten not knowing where my safe place was I chose solitude I learnt out of sight out of mind (didn’t even work all the time but nigga I tried) My mum became pregnant again… (this was not necessary but I've grown to love the child) so now they are soon to be 5 kids and none of which already receive and adequate amount of love. Just to further paint the character of my father he beat my younger sister who was at the time maybe 3/4 because she took and hid his phone (later revealed he left it in his jacket pocket) NO APOLOGY HAS EVER BEEN GIVEN EVER IN HISTORY FOR A MISTAKEN BEATING. We spent little time in that house but what do ire member being dragged from under a bed to be beaten and being beaten nearly every morning without fail for 1/2  years for bed wetting (punches were not pulled).   


We moved again after same sort of thing really he’d show up for a few days fuck up everyones mood and cut no one wanted him around but no body would say because everyone was afraid of getting beat again. This is the house I lived in when I decided ahh man maybe this life thing isn’t for me went and sat at the window ledge in my room 3rd floor looking down and wished I could just let go. We would be locked in the attic this time the door is genuinely locked we couldn’t get out if we wanted room was what 3x4 meters storage room basically and 3 of us had been locked in there for the whole day. Living in such circumstances created bitch nigga behaviour amongst us as brothers because the beatings were bad you did not want to be beaten it would fuck your whole shit up. So niggas started snitching bruh my own brother came in my room while I was learning to beat my meat took my phone took pictures of what I was watching and then showed everyone while I was sat in the living room… I was then promptly beaten. This the environment I grew up in even in your own fucking room you couldn’t do shit you couldn’t trust nobody and you were very likely going to be fucked up for anything you did. This could include but was not limited to holding your brothers hand while fighting… (that’s gay apparently so you would be beaten). Defending yourself to your parents (Its rude to speak back so I was beaten), Not speaking (its rude to not speak when spoken to so I was beaten). Finishing the milk bruh imagine your 12 year old hungry self wanted some cereal finished it and then gone beaten for it that was my fucking life. Id go to school this fat unloved ugly kid, (I think this is a good time to point out I went to a bad school in a white neighbour hood and as we all know aint nothing scarier than poor white people jk…) but those guys were harsh to me day one of highschool I had a fight why because I was being racially abused, I was constantly racially abused I was not even accepted by my own race because I wasn’t black enough (I am quarter white 3 quated black so skin color dark brown meant I was a paki, I was an Indian I was a terrorist osama bin laden was my uncle so on and so forth) aint no body ever gave a shit about me not a single teacher not no body. And this is where things get fucked up for me this when I started doing dumb shit I started being a prick to my friends not fully understanding what was even going on but just thinking out of I gotta cover my back I gotta make sure I aint no punk but in reality it made me into a punk. But ill get to that later. I still remember everything nice people have ever said to me that I felt was said genuinely though, once the most popular kid in school told me to not let anyone pick on me and just tell them im not Asian although I had tried both I felt his sincerity and very much appreciated it and still think about it to this day. 

I wanna fast forward now to year 11 when shit really hits the fan, I moved to a school which was mixed gender (years 7-10 I was in a boy school) and the introduction of women had definitely caught my eyes (hadn’t seen them in many years since everyday was school mosque home runescape repeat maaaaaaaaaan FUCK THAT SHIT that’s the worst childhood and to make it better slide a couple hundred beatings in over those 3 years and now you might be beginning to get a grasp on who I am as a person. Of course they are little moments when things workout but not really. To summarise I was in love or atleast I felt like I was I did horribly on my exams which at the time I accreted to me just focusing my time on her and not myself and that started the downwards spiral. My little brother told my parents I wasn’t fasting at prom (I have not ever fasted a day since, pretty sure I gave up on religion a long time ago but that’s its own thing) and I was beaten then locked in the house so I could not attend my final meeting for NCS (I had saved up my 5 a week for 10 weeks to pay the 50 to go and now I just couldn’t imagine that feeling I was going to finally be away from this whole home all summer and now I couldn’t why because my dad who had now moved in full time had decided to spite me).  


The summer of finishing high school of enjoyment had arrived my plans to be with my friends had been put to a halt. My plans of going to a top 3 college in the city had been put to a halt. My summer was instead me just sitting in my room everyday the whole summer alone not talking to anyone for multiple days at a time. This is when my solitude became serious I became an awkward nervous rek after this I couldn’t even talk to people properly without overthinking everything id say if summer was 10 days long I was beaten on 6/7 days as well so yh torture house and to make it better I had no friends because we moved so fucking much I didn’t know a single person and couldn’t get to know them because we lived in a jewish neighbour hood and if you’ve ever lived in one as the only black muslim family you aint going to have no friend. But yh returned to college and it was ok except for everyday I would come home and be locked out of my house everyday without fail my dad would sit in the kitchen looking out the window and laugh at me having nowhere else to go so I would sit in the gardens storage cupboard nothing much at all probably just a big wardrobe but It was dry. I would then go to college and repeat this process day by day mentally exhausting my self little by little more once again through in beatings on.4 out of every 10 days and you have the image of what my first year of college was like. My parents decided as a family we should read the quran together (muslim people book not all of it like a page each a day) so I read my page and left and while I was goning upstairs I heard him talking about me so I decided ah im probably going to be beaten let me stay here and wait so I did and soon enough I heard him say “why did he read that page, he read that a few days ago hes looking for the easy ones” so my mum said “ill call him back down and he can read again”, I was called “….. come downstairs and read again” and I replied “Whats the point nothing I do is good enough for him anyway” to which he responded by walking into the kitchen getting a metal pole and coming to hit me with it. The best bit for him it was a detached house so no one could even hear my screams. At first I tried to block with my left arm and then I just couldn’t hold it up anymore so I switched to the right and the same happened so then I was just lying there being beaten by my dad with a metal pole bleeding all over the floor from my head and when he thought he was done he left. This day is the day I lost my shit as soon as I could stand I went and grabbed a knife but was stopped by my mother (I always found it funny how she would always come to stop me but never him). I then called the police when they arrived they was so much blood on the ground floor corridor that she threw shoes over to hide it because it could not be cleaned while he sat there on the sofa smug knowing he had gotten away with it my mum had hidden me from the police and that was that another great day in the life. 

I had become sick of it and told my mum I do not care what she thinks I am tired and I am leaving I will go to foster care if I must but I am not dealing with this shit anymore (I don’t know if its important but I was also 17 without a phone or laptop or any communication with the outside world, if I was in my room all day I was playing badminton against the wall staring at the ceiling or creating fantasies in my mind to rescue me from where I was currently) I told her ill get a job (just received ni number) ill figure it out for myself and what did she do?

She said nothing for maybe a month and then we were moving house so she came in one morning and just told me we are moving pack up so I did thinking we are moving away from that cunt and she had chosen me her son over her manipulative controlling abusive husband… Instead she had rented another place and just dropped me off there would come round maybe every month or 2 for an hour or so and that was my life. Now I was completely secluded and this was the first time I actually tried to kill myself I had a panic attack the anxiety just got to me I took all my sleeping pills at once and boom I woke up the next day… they were all fucking natural herbal things and they couldn’t do shit. Bummer I know. She still doesn’t know about this I continued thinking about killing my self shit I never stopped from that first time till now but It was just thoughts and ideas I had finally tried to and failed. Instead I started smoking weed which would help sometimes but other times like I learnt the hardway it would make me think about my life and whats actually happened and compare it to my peers around me and I would breakdown crying. My life has no direction, I have no family around me (which is ironic in a family of 13(3 parents 10 kids))because we had all been tormented soo much we didn’t know to look out for eachother we had to look out for our selves first. This is why im selfish I cant afford to not be because if im not my own number 1 In terms of in a greedy way like If I don’t look out for ME first no one else will. My mum then told me she didn’t want to continue paying for where I lived and I had to find somewhere else (now that I was 18/19) which is a real bitch because if I had just done what I wanted to years back and left this family of suffering I would have been alright but instead now im going to college everyday thinking about where tf am I going to live. So I dropped out of college to work, I ended up returning to college having to restart living in a city different to the one I studied in working night shifts to then go straight in to class but I figured it out. Got to uni and guess what I don’t know what the fuck is going on. 

Everyone is social and I don’t know how to socialise sometimes I feel as though I stand out so badly that im just not supposed to be there im surrounded by people who life has blessed people who have seen the world people whos parents love them soo much that they even come to watch them train at uni. In my whole fucking life there has never been a single thing I've done which I can say I looked into the crowd and had a single person there to support me. Instead I have been told to dream is free, I've been told your not going to make anything with your life and you are going to be a failure. Honestly I have accepted these as truths now. I don’t even feel like myself anymore I feel stupid as if i took a couple too many hits to the head information doesn’t sink in properly anymore. I'm embarraced in class because everyone else knows what they are doing to some level I have no fucking idea everyone else goes home for Christmas or there family comes to visit. LOOOL my family don’t give a single fuck. I AM ALONE IN THIS WORLD TIRED DEPRESSED AND READY TO GO. I accepted death a little while back, one night I was lying in bed crying and realised I don’t have to deal with this anymore I really don’t I have accepted I will kill myself and I am just waiting for the day in which I get my final little nudge to step of the ledge.

I just want to be at peace.

I also had a girlfriend for a while she cheated on me so I stopped valuing her as a person and just kept her for the other stuff. She even got pregnant and aborted it. I'm 20.

&lt;p&gt;·  As a child I would pee in my sleep so I would be woken up by a belt hitting my body&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;·  As all kids do I would fall asleep on the sofa watching tv, so I would be woken up with a belt hitting my body&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;·  I once told my dad there was no point in doing something AGAIN because nothing was good enough for him… to which I was beaten with a metal pole until I could no longer use my arms to defend my self and just took blows to the head dripping blood all over the house.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;To summarise I have been fucked up.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But im trying to figure out how and when this all started at what point did I become the person I am now (Afraid ,insecure ,manipulative and untrustworthy). I give myself these attributes because that’s all I really am. I am afraid of the world horrified possibly I have ran out of classes (IN FUCKING UNI) because I felt as if everyone was looking on me I have this crippling feeling that everyone is always looking at me. Insecure lol I don’t even know what to say I have deleted everything on my social media’s multiple times purely because the anxiety of someone giving a fuck enough to look at them and then the possibility of them finding my pictures funny gives me so much anxiety that I’d prefer them not be there. Am I manipulative yes, but I don’t understand how one can not be manipulative. I like to have things my way of course we all do but I know how to get it done I know how to get responses out of people or to get people to do what I want because I had to learn to. I&amp;#39;m one of fucking 10 children and I showed up in the middle and this wasn’t no brady bunch happy family shit this was controlling, abusive and manipulative and I guess that’s what I became, you are a product of your environment after all. I don’t really know the purpose or direction of this as I have just stopped crying again (its 2:13pm) and decided fuck it imma do this so if I do kms at least maybe one mf’er can know what I been trying to say.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So guys I think im going crazy this is a new development if you don’t mind me starting here, I sit in my room and talk to myself inside my head for hours a day full on conversations (guess this is what happens when you don’t get to train social skills). Sometime’s I cry sometimes I get so angry I don’t even know what to do and sometimes admittedly I feel straight up heart broken as if I have been done a disservice by the world and unfairly I was born into one family instead of another. I fantasize too much and I kind of sorta relate to people from Netflix series. Like Joe the stalker I get it bro you just want to feel a solid love that aint going no where and youll do anything to keep that but in turn you require a few things loyalty being one of them. Fortunately I can say I don’t relate to him with his killing (that would just be another burden in my head to drive me crazier) instead when my heart is broken people just kick the pieces to side and move on. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fuuuuuuck im really not good at structuring things I write.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ok I think the logical thing to do is start with little stories from childhood and work my way to present day. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was born in 1998 in Africa and moved to the United Kingdom at a young age not sure how young because I don’t remember. My dad had been previously married and had 5 children from his first wife and at this time only 3 from my mum me and my 2 brothers one a year older one a year younger. It’s said that when I was born they thought I was a fucked up baby, I was going to be disabled or something of the sorts (not in a doctor said it way, but like I was born and they looked at me and said na this aint it way and little would you know my little brother was born just under 10 months later) Fantastic way to start life. So we all lived in one house when we first got to the UK (very vague memory of this shit by the way combination of what I&amp;#39;ve been told as fact and what I know to be true) So as a kid I have been described as a quiet and timid kid so quiet infact that my older brother and sister (age 12-14) (from a different mother) would pinch me or hit me to make me cry because when I would cry it was funny that I would make no noise.  I was also a huge fan of lion king asking them to watch it multiple times a day with me, everyday. We then moved a couple times memory all blurry and we arrived at the next destination that I remember. We lived in a flat in a small town in England for a couple years, my memories of this place are my   constantly injuring himself severly by playing out, dbz, Toonami, vegeta and ps2. I was a normal kid but I would get fucked up by my dad. (btw im around 4-6 years old) I still remember the time I was called downstairs just to be beaten I think for drawing a rude picture that was discovered after I had just been beaten. Boom boom not too much going on just the entrance to a life of suffering but not too much tbh.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We then moved to a council house elsewhere just kids and mum because dad had decided its stressful to live with people so he’d rather pay 1k+ rent elsewhere for his own place then help his family. These years weren’t too bad though if anything they were my favourite because he wasn’t around it was just us 3 years in that place from year 2- year 5. He would still drive down though on occasion just to hit us and then return to his home on the flip side of the uk. This was fantastic for my personal growth of course as I learnt that being a father means coming over shouting and arguing with your wife, beating your children and then cutting. And by beating I mean sure we were between ages 7/8-10 but he would hit us with all he had leave belt marks for days all over my body. To the extent the neighbour’s would hear us screaming and would then mock us the next day as we walked to school. He then thought that we were becoming bad children (at the time me and all my siblings were top in our classes thanks to our mum keeping us up to study with her , as well as this at this age we started being forced to go to mosque mon- fri (5-7) and then over the weekends we would go to Arabic school and if we were at home we would play outside in the park so I don’t know how bad we could of really been but who knows.(she was in college so while she did her homework she helped us with ours)). Actually with that being said I would steal from my mum not a lot and not everyday but a pound or 2 here and there just because everyone else in school could afford to buy things like sweets and toys and I would never be able to join in because I had none. I would come home from school and mums not in so id have to sit outside the house for a couple hours people would walk by but I had no friends house to go to like my brothers so I would just sit at the door and wait. My life has been hell maybe its easy from an outside view to say naa aint that bad but try live it everyday you come home aint no body even in, by the time everyone does get in its all at once no time for you and mum to talk no dad asking how was school bruh go to  sleep. To summarize though I was studying everyday 7 days a week and still being beaten along with my brothers but I had a newly born sister and it was time for the move to the big city so fuck it maybe its about to get better.Bruh I forgot and now remembered this nigga would look all 3 of us in the garage for whole days just because and the punishment for leaving would be you get beat and thrown back in there. Think about the mentally how much that would fuck you up you aint even fucking 10 yet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When we first got to this new city we were quick to discover its rough out there day one we were robbed. They were no more parks we could just go to play at so now I became and indoors kid. To go along with that now my dad didn’t live too far away he was only in the neighbouring town so instead of monthly “visits” it was now weekly. Fair enough to say within a year I had put on I don’t know 10 maybe 15kg I was fat af going into year 7 but in year 6 I was a very thin framed kid. I was depressed and I&amp;#39;m not sure if I knew it but my life consisted of go to school and be bullied to come home and be beaten not knowing where my safe place was I chose solitude I learnt out of sight out of mind (didn’t even work all the time but nigga I tried) My mum became pregnant again… (this was not necessary but I&amp;#39;ve grown to love the child) so now they are soon to be 5 kids and none of which already receive and adequate amount of love. Just to further paint the character of my father he beat my younger sister who was at the time maybe 3/4 because she took and hid his phone (later revealed he left it in his jacket pocket) NO APOLOGY HAS EVER BEEN GIVEN EVER IN HISTORY FOR A MISTAKEN BEATING. We spent little time in that house but what do ire member being dragged from under a bed to be beaten and being beaten nearly every morning without fail for 1/2  years for bed wetting (punches were not pulled).   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We moved again after same sort of thing really he’d show up for a few days fuck up everyones mood and cut no one wanted him around but no body would say because everyone was afraid of getting beat again. This is the house I lived in when I decided ahh man maybe this life thing isn’t for me went and sat at the window ledge in my room 3rd floor looking down and wished I could just let go. We would be locked in the attic this time the door is genuinely locked we couldn’t get out if we wanted room was what 3x4 meters storage room basically and 3 of us had been locked in there for the whole day. Living in such circumstances created bitch nigga behaviour amongst us as brothers because the beatings were bad you did not want to be beaten it would fuck your whole shit up. So niggas started snitching bruh my own brother came in my room while I was learning to beat my meat took my phone took pictures of what I was watching and then showed everyone while I was sat in the living room… I was then promptly beaten. This the environment I grew up in even in your own fucking room you couldn’t do shit you couldn’t trust nobody and you were very likely going to be fucked up for anything you did. This could include but was not limited to holding your brothers hand while fighting… (that’s gay apparently so you would be beaten). Defending yourself to your parents (Its rude to speak back so I was beaten), Not speaking (its rude to not speak when spoken to so I was beaten). Finishing the milk bruh imagine your 12 year old hungry self wanted some cereal finished it and then gone beaten for it that was my fucking life. Id go to school this fat unloved ugly kid, (I think this is a good time to point out I went to a bad school in a white neighbour hood and as we all know aint nothing scarier than poor white people jk…) but those guys were harsh to me day one of highschool I had a fight why because I was being racially abused, I was constantly racially abused I was not even accepted by my own race because I wasn’t black enough (I am quarter white 3 quated black so skin color dark brown meant I was a paki, I was an Indian I was a terrorist osama bin laden was my uncle so on and so forth) aint no body ever gave a shit about me not a single teacher not no body. And this is where things get fucked up for me this when I started doing dumb shit I started being a prick to my friends not fully understanding what was even going on but just thinking out of I gotta cover my back I gotta make sure I aint no punk but in reality it made me into a punk. But ill get to that later. I still remember everything nice people have ever said to me that I felt was said genuinely though, once the most popular kid in school told me to not let anyone pick on me and just tell them im not Asian although I had tried both I felt his sincerity and very much appreciated it and still think about it to this day. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I wanna fast forward now to year 11 when shit really hits the fan, I moved to a school which was mixed gender (years 7-10 I was in a boy school) and the introduction of women had definitely caught my eyes (hadn’t seen them in many years since everyday was school mosque home runescape repeat maaaaaaaaaan FUCK THAT SHIT that’s the worst childhood and to make it better slide a couple hundred beatings in over those 3 years and now you might be beginning to get a grasp on who I am as a person. Of course they are little moments when things workout but not really. To summarise I was in love or atleast I felt like I was I did horribly on my exams which at the time I accreted to me just focusing my time on her and not myself and that started the downwards spiral. My little brother told my parents I wasn’t fasting at prom (I have not ever fasted a day since, pretty sure I gave up on religion a long time ago but that’s its own thing) and I was beaten then locked in the house so I could not attend my final meeting for NCS (I had saved up my 5 a week for 10 weeks to pay the 50 to go and now I just couldn’t imagine that feeling I was going to finally be away from this whole home all summer and now I couldn’t why because my dad who had now moved in full time had decided to spite me).  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The summer of finishing high school of enjoyment had arrived my plans to be with my friends had been put to a halt. My plans of going to a top 3 college in the city had been put to a halt. My summer was instead me just sitting in my room everyday the whole summer alone not talking to anyone for multiple days at a time. This is when my solitude became serious I became an awkward nervous rek after this I couldn’t even talk to people properly without overthinking everything id say if summer was 10 days long I was beaten on 6/7 days as well so yh torture house and to make it better I had no friends because we moved so fucking much I didn’t know a single person and couldn’t get to know them because we lived in a jewish neighbour hood and if you’ve ever lived in one as the only black muslim family you aint going to have no friend. But yh returned to college and it was ok except for everyday I would come home and be locked out of my house everyday without fail my dad would sit in the kitchen looking out the window and laugh at me having nowhere else to go so I would sit in the gardens storage cupboard nothing much at all probably just a big wardrobe but It was dry. I would then go to college and repeat this process day by day mentally exhausting my self little by little more once again through in beatings on.4 out of every 10 days and you have the image of what my first year of college was like. My parents decided as a family we should read the quran together (muslim people book not all of it like a page each a day) so I read my page and left and while I was goning upstairs I heard him talking about me so I decided ah im probably going to be beaten let me stay here and wait so I did and soon enough I heard him say “why did he read that page, he read that a few days ago hes looking for the easy ones” so my mum said “ill call him back down and he can read again”, I was called “….. come downstairs and read again” and I replied “Whats the point nothing I do is good enough for him anyway” to which he responded by walking into the kitchen getting a metal pole and coming to hit me with it. The best bit for him it was a detached house so no one could even hear my screams. At first I tried to block with my left arm and then I just couldn’t hold it up anymore so I switched to the right and the same happened so then I was just lying there being beaten by my dad with a metal pole bleeding all over the floor from my head and when he thought he was done he left. This day is the day I lost my shit as soon as I could stand I went and grabbed a knife but was stopped by my mother (I always found it funny how she would always come to stop me but never him). I then called the police when they arrived they was so much blood on the ground floor corridor that she threw shoes over to hide it because it could not be cleaned while he sat there on the sofa smug knowing he had gotten away with it my mum had hidden me from the police and that was that another great day in the life. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I had become sick of it and told my mum I do not care what she thinks I am tired and I am leaving I will go to foster care if I must but I am not dealing with this shit anymore (I don’t know if its important but I was also 17 without a phone or laptop or any communication with the outside world, if I was in my room all day I was playing badminton against the wall staring at the ceiling or creating fantasies in my mind to rescue me from where I was currently) I told her ill get a job (just received ni number) ill figure it out for myself and what did she do?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She said nothing for maybe a month and then we were moving house so she came in one morning and just told me we are moving pack up so I did thinking we are moving away from that cunt and she had chosen me her son over her manipulative controlling abusive husband… Instead she had rented another place and just dropped me off there would come round maybe every month or 2 for an hour or so and that was my life. Now I was completely secluded and this was the first time I actually tried to kill myself I had a panic attack the anxiety just got to me I took all my sleeping pills at once and boom I woke up the next day… they were all fucking natural herbal things and they couldn’t do shit. Bummer I know. She still doesn’t know about this I continued thinking about killing my self shit I never stopped from that first time till now but It was just thoughts and ideas I had finally tried to and failed. Instead I started smoking weed which would help sometimes but other times like I learnt the hardway it would make me think about my life and whats actually happened and compare it to my peers around me and I would breakdown crying. My life has no direction, I have no family around me (which is ironic in a family of 13(3 parents 10 kids))because we had all been tormented soo much we didn’t know to look out for eachother we had to look out for our selves first. This is why im selfish I cant afford to not be because if im not my own number 1 In terms of in a greedy way like If I don’t look out for ME first no one else will. My mum then told me she didn’t want to continue paying for where I lived and I had to find somewhere else (now that I was 18/19) which is a real bitch because if I had just done what I wanted to years back and left this family of suffering I would have been alright but instead now im going to college everyday thinking about where tf am I going to live. So I dropped out of college to work, I ended up returning to college having to restart living in a city different to the one I studied in working night shifts to then go straight in to class but I figured it out. Got to uni and guess what I don’t know what the fuck is going on. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Everyone is social and I don’t know how to socialise sometimes I feel as though I stand out so badly that im just not supposed to be there im surrounded by people who life has blessed people who have seen the world people whos parents love them soo much that they even come to watch them train at uni. In my whole fucking life there has never been a single thing I&amp;#39;ve done which I can say I looked into the crowd and had a single person there to support me. Instead I have been told to dream is free, I&amp;#39;ve been told your not going to make anything with your life and you are going to be a failure. Honestly I have accepted these as truths now. I don’t even feel like myself anymore I feel stupid as if i took a couple too many hits to the head information doesn’t sink in properly anymore. I&amp;#39;m embarraced in class because everyone else knows what they are doing to some level I have no fucking idea everyone else goes home for Christmas or there family comes to visit. LOOOL my family don’t give a single fuck. I AM ALONE IN THIS WORLD TIRED DEPRESSED AND READY TO GO. I accepted death a little while back, one night I was lying in bed crying and realised I don’t have to deal with this anymore I really don’t I have accepted I will kill myself and I am just waiting for the day in which I get my final little nudge to step of the ledge.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I just want to be at peace.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also had a girlfriend for a while she cheated on me so I stopped valuing her as a person and just kept her for the other stuff. She even got pregnant and aborted it. I&amp;#39;m 20.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Question… am I crazy for feeling like this? And if you were in my shoes do you think you would feel the same or different.&lt;/p&gt;

,SuicideWatch,"I've never talked about this with anyone, but I really don't want to live anymore. Because what is the point? Why am I here? I can't do anything useful in my life until I become an adult, I ruin almost everything, I cut a lot and am always worried someone will see the scars. I get confused when I see people genuinely enjoying themselves and having fun. It blows my mind. How are they so happy? How can anyone love themselves? I don't love myself. I'm fact I hate myself. Because I deserve it. What use am I to anyone? 

The answer is none. I'm not of any use. And you know why? It's because whenever I've tried to be useful I mess it up. So, what's the point? What the point of enduring an existence that I can't seem to enjoy? I haven't been diagnosed with depression, so I'm not going to claim that I have it. But, what other explanation is there? And even if that is the explanation, does it even matter? Does anything really matter?

I get confused when I see people genuinely enjoying themselves and having fun. It blows my mind. How are they so happy? How can anyone love themselves? I don&amp;#39;t love myself. I&amp;#39;m fact I hate myself. Because I deserve it. What use am I to anyone? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The answer is none. I&amp;#39;m not of any use. And you know why? It&amp;#39;s because whenever I&amp;#39;ve tried to be useful I mess it up. So, what&amp;#39;s the point? What the point of enduring an existence that I can&amp;#39;t seem to enjoy? I haven&amp;#39;t been diagnosed with depression, so I&amp;#39;m not going to claim that I have it. But, what other explanation is there? And even if that is the explanation, does it even matter? Does anything really matter?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To whoever read this all the way through, (I know this sounds cliche) thank you for reading my scattered thoughts and emotions. I hope you have a good day tomorrow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Update: I haven&amp;#39;t been able to talk to my mom as she&amp;#39;s kind of having a &amp;#39;quiet time&amp;#39; day and I don&amp;#39;t want to bother her. I also have a question. Would it be unhealthy for her if I talk to her? She has anxiety/panic disorder and although she hasn&amp;#39;t had a panic attack in several months I don&amp;#39;t want to cause her too much stress. (Sorry I didn&amp;#39;t mention this before),&lt;/p&gt;

,SuicideWatch,"Not gonna lie, I feel like a fucking dumbass typing this. But I’m failing at life, really want to die, and am too embarrassed to explain to the people closest to me that I would rather die than proceed with my futile attempts at life. So here I am, on reddit, for some unknown fucking reason. I guess I just need to vent and this seems like the best place because I’m sure no one I know will look here. So here it goes

I’m 23. Live in my parents basement with an amazing girl that I really don’t deserve. Most of my life I’ve been the quiet kid. Most people were scared of me in school because of that, but I’m too much of a pussy to actually do anything. Only reason anyone would talk to me was because I played football and went to school with most of my team. 

From elementary school through middle school I was really fucking ugly. Acne was terrible, huge fucking nose, no confidence. Had like 2 encounters with girls during this time period and I was a hardcore “nice guy.” Those 2 encounters were enough for everyone to realize I’m pretty fucking retarded. So most people avoided me. High school I peaked. (and by peak I really don’t mean much. Just the time that I wasn’t absolutely pathetic) Met the girl I’m with now, got in really good shape and did pretty good in football. Managed to get fucking C’s all throughout though so I got no scholarship for college. 

After high school my parents were amazing enough to pay for my college. 5000 fucking dollars a semester for me to do average my first semester then fail calculus my second semester. After my second semester I let my father convince me that I should go to school closer to home and do electrical engineering. First semester I did average. Next semester I failed fucking Chemistry and lab. Semester after that I failed my chemistry lab again so I had to switch to Computer engineering. Semester after that I failed Pde’s. Pretty much every semester after that I’ve failed classes. Not because I’m not learning the material but because I’m so fucking lazy I don’t do half the homework. Usually my homework grades suck but my test scores are good but not good enough to keep me from failing. Every year my parents keep telling me that they are going to make me move out and pay for my own school, but they keep giving me more chances and I keep royal fucking those chances. Honestly don’t understand why they give me so many chances. 

Anyways, this year isn’t any different. Last semester I took 3 fucking classes (9 credit hours) and failed all three of my classes. Worst I’ve ever done. So this current semester I’m retaking 2 of the 3 I failed and just had to withdraw from one of them and the other I will probably get a C in. I don’t get it. I have a part time job at fucking Chili’s, I live at home, have everything going for me; don’t have to worry about expenses, amazing girlfriend, family that loves me. Yet I can’t fucking pass two fucking classes.

I’m a failure. Honestly no other explanation. I get to tell my mother that after this semester I am dropping out and moving out, therefore waisting 50,000$ of her money. Thing is, if I can’t pass two fucking classes how the fuck an I suppose to live on my own. Other thing is, I wouldn’t be on my own, my girlfriend would be with me which makes everything worse because I would be dragging her down with me. So instead of moving out I have decided I should probably just kill myself. I’ve planned it out for the most part. I have a 30-06 in my room that guarantees my death, I’ve scouted a place out where no one will be able to find my corpse. I haven’t written my goodbye letter because I’m honestly too pathetic to write one and probably won’t even leave one, I plan on depositing all of my money into an account that my girlfriend has access to so she can get out of this house as quickly as possible if need be, etc...

I know my death will negatively impact those closest too me but I’m almost positive my parents will get over it. Honestly my father has given up on me so I don’t think he’ll care much. My grandparents will be devastated but they will get over it.
Only one I’m worried about is my girlfriend. She’s about to start a new job right when I plan on killing myself and I don’t want to ruin that. I’m sure I can figure something out.

At the same time. I really don’t want to die. It still breaks my heart that I have to leave everything behind. My family has two amazing dogs that I would die for, I managed to go out with a girl way out of my league for 5 years that’s about to get a job relevant to her dream career, I have grandparents, aunts, and uncles that all seem to like me, etc...

Guess I’ll just bring a couple bottles to try and get over that heartbreak so I can pull the trigger.

Anyways, sorry to start my own fucking pity party. It was just hurting me to not say or write anything before I die since I’ve done relatively good at hiding my depression from everyone.

After a few weeks of consideration and paranoia I finally sucked it up and went there to inquire. I almost felt proud of myself for taking that step. Then I found out there's a four month waitlist.  Fuck that. I can't wait that long. I need help now.

I live in a broken, poor city with little opportunity. I can't afford to move away. I was neglected by my parents as a child and abused as a teen. I never had a true parental figure. I have no idea what the hell I'm doing with my life. Thoughts of suicide began when I was eleven years old. I've tried to hang myself once with a belt but it broke. I have no true family aside from my grandmother. The only friends I have are long distance ones whom I met on the internet years ago and only talk to every month or so.

Now I can't see myself anywhere in the future.

,SuicideWatch,"Ive been depressed for a couple of years now, ive been suicidal too for the past 3 years. One of the main reasons is my family. I’m an outsider to them, i chose that i don’t want to be religious or what they wanted me to be. They tried to mould me into the model son, i hate it. Ive spoke on to a lot of people online, who’ve become my close friends, but in the beginning of this year, i lost my closest friend, of 3 years. He was an inspiration to me, and now that he’s gone i feel alone. I have friends still but they slowly drift further each coming day.

Recently, i was telling dark jokes as a coping mechanism, it helps relieve stress when i make jokes about stuff. I slipped up and made a joke that offended a girl in my class, she went to the head of student affairs in my school and complained about me, despite having apologised at least 5 times. Parents got involved too, and news spreads like wildfire. I don’t feel like going to school tomorrow, because the last thing i want is this stress from my peers.

Its not my peers that are the problem though, it’s my family. They’re religious and believe you should never joke about the stuff i do. (I still joke about the things i do because my mental state has deteriorated). I have depression, insomnia and ptsd. My family doesn’t know. In about an hour i have to either confess everything that’s wrong, which’ll probably give me shit to deal with x20 worse, or i can kill myself today. Im heavily weighing the options. I don’t want to live, to suffer, anymore. I’ve attempted in the past and i pussied out in the last moments. But this time, if i have to, i will. I can’t live like this anymore. I’d probably get disowned if i called the child support hotline, and i go to a private school on an academic scholarship, so i’ll have to move schools, which’d mean i’d lose my closest friends in real life.

Im pretty much failing every class, flunking every class, i don’t do work anymore, im constantly in pain. My head thumps everyday with migraines and i cant focus, i can only stay sane from my dogs and music. Im in love with videogames, but my pc died last september so i havent been able to play and it made me really sad. 

I just want some incentive to live, to keep going, but i cant see anything but my future going dim. I’m in school typing this out. Im hoping by some insane luck that i can make it through this. I promised myself that depending how my year started out, i’d contemplate suicide. I decided that i would do it in feb but didnt, so i want to do it today. Idk how i’ll make it through this.

I just don't know where to start... I'm feeling really helpless to be honest. I feel like a burden, like a parasite. Every day, pain is with me. Joy is temporary. I surrender at this point. My childhood has been a mess with my dysfunctional parents. I've never been good. If you want to have an idea, my mother has a borderline personality disorder, which means she was violent, physically and emotionally. My father is narcissistic, he abused me emotionally, making me feel like a burden. Never keeping his promises. I've never been happy for a long time with them. I'd say, for my life, 10% happy, 90% in pain. Now I'm 21, I don't know how I survived at this point, but I reached my limit. I tried to take my life away, wasn't a success. My family learned it, and for a moment I thought they finally considered me, but it was for such a short amount of time. I'm always walking on eggs with my parents.

She was my real family, I really loved her and she was always there for me, she kinda helped me a lot with her caring presence. It destroyed me.

,SuicideWatch,"Hello. Never really wrote about myself online but I’m very curious and the stigma behind death seems to discourage discussion of it. I’ve actively tried talking to my family and a therapist about my perception of my life but their inability to understand that it does not and never has stemmed from depression irritates me. 

I want to die. I believe that death is the ultimate end goal for every single human being and rapidly increasing its approach would lead me to the end. Please note, I have a social life. I have close friends at college and at work. I also have a pretty active socia life (I go to a couple parties here and there). I’m in a solid relationship (been together for two years now), and I do not abuse drugs or alcohol, only at kick backs or something. I do not have depression, I’m pretty laid back down to earth guy who has never had any mental illness nor any thoughts of worthlessness, extreme sadness etc. 

Personally, the meaningless within life is the main motivator for my methodology. Realistically, the now is true living (due to its value, the past you can’t change and the future is unknown). Past the now, life is to be, not happening. Work, sex, love, entertainment, etc. are used to keep individuals living but what for? We work a 9-5 job, we have kids, we do all of these things and yet the reasoning boils down to survival and entertainment. entertainment to keep us looped within an endless cycle of netflix shows or games or tv shows or youtube and survival of work to eat and feed the future generation. realistically, love is a chemical compound effect which sparks to motivate the production of kids. to continue the species. the love of a parent to a child is to prevent child hood death so the child can become a parent and produce more children for the cycle to continue. when you really boil down what life is it’s just an endless cycle of continuation within a species. 

Idk i’m just curious if anyone else feels this way. You develop your own meaning in life but that meaning isn’t even yours. You are taught that meaning through society and social interactions. Your parents develop that meaning for you and you believe it’s yours but in reality it isn’t. The pursuit of a good job or a big house or to produce music or to be a serial killer all of these perceptions you learn from society in which you incorporate into your definition of life. how you want to live isn’t even your own perception it’s just a jumble of social expectations mixed into you.

If anyone can help me understand this it’d be a great help.

,SuicideWatch,"Preface, I'm a bit drunk rn, it helps numb this pain.

A girl I knew and I had hooked up with in the past, then became friends with commit suicide recently. We weren't close but I'd consider her a special friend to me. We rarely saw each other, but when we did we had the best banter known to man.  


I'm doing great in school, have a girlfriend, got internships lined up and was happy before this. But now, since she commit suicide, the only thing that makes sense to me is to kill myself. I've had depressive episodes before but this feels different. Everytime my thoughts are blank or I zone out, my first thought is the fact she is actually gone. Last time I tried to commit suicide was 5 years ago, and even then it wasn't this impactful.

&amp;#x200B;

For some reason this girl's suicide has really fucked with me and makes me feel like suicide is a reasonable option. It makes me feel like I have a new purpose. I feel like there is something extraordinary waiting for me. I almost feel as if she is waiting for me.

&amp;#x200B;

I got home in a cab and cried the entire way. The cab driver said nothing. I said nothing. When he looked at me I felt he had accepted my fate as I had. Perhaps there is more, perhaps there isn't. But I do want to cry more, but I'm not close enough to the girl to deserve pity.

&amp;#x200B;

As I am typing this out I feel better.  I feel as if I do not need to die right now but I do crave death. Just not at my hand. I accept being murdered, I accept an accident. 

&amp;#x200B;

I just wish it was over.",t2_5uos0v0f,False,,0,False,"A girl I knew commit suicide, now I want to",[],r/SuicideWatch,False,0,,0,False,t3_fds24u,False,dark,,public,1,0,{},,False,[],,False,False,,{},,False,1,,False,,False,,[],{},,True,,1583424031.0,text,0,,,text,self.SuicideWatch,False,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Preface, I&amp;#39;m a bit drunk rn, it helps numb this pain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A girl I knew and I had hooked up with in the past, then became friends with commit suicide recently. We weren&amp;#39;t close but I&amp;#39;d consider her a special friend to me. We rarely saw each other, but when we did we had the best banter known to man.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m doing great in school, have a girlfriend, got internships lined up and was happy before this. But now, since she commit suicide, the only thing that makes sense to me is to kill myself. I&amp;#39;ve had depressive episodes before but this feels different. Everytime my thoughts are blank or I zone out, my first thought is the fact she is actually gone. Last time I tried to commit suicide was 5 years ago, and even then it wasn&amp;#39;t this impactful.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For some reason this girl&amp;#39;s suicide has really fucked with me and makes me feel like suicide is a reasonable option. It makes me feel like I have a new purpose. I feel like there is something extraordinary waiting for me. I almost feel as if she is waiting for me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I got home in a cab and cried the entire way. The cab driver said nothing. I said nothing. When he looked at me I felt he had accepted my fate as I had. Perhaps there is more, perhaps there isn&amp;#39;t. But I do want to cry more, but I&amp;#39;m not close enough to the girl to deserve pity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As I am typing this out I feel better.  I feel as if I do not need to die right now but I do crave death. Just not at my hand. I accept being murdered, I accept an accident. &lt;/p&gt;

After waiting for a late payment of Unemployment to come in, and my husband and i taking everything of value to us (PS4, Switch, and even his guitar) to the pawn shop, we&amp;#39;re a solid $60 short on rent with no income in sight for the remaining days we have to pay. 
I put my name out for emergency commissions as i figure people might go for it, but in all honesty, no one has. 
Another bomb dropped on me today was that this &amp;quot;flu&amp;quot; my 3 year old daughter has had for a few days now is actually Scarlet Fever. Who gets scarlet fever? Is this the 1800s? What happens if my newborn son catches it from her? Is this year the year i lose a child and face my biggest and deepest fear? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Idk man. I just wish this year would stop kicking my ass...i just needed to tell the world.&lt;/p&gt;

,SuicideWatch,"I can't fcking take this any longer, this post probably won't help me much but I'm so desperate that I'll try anything to have a glimpse of hope. I'm so confused that I can't even write a proper text begging for help, a very simple act can become so complex and overwhelming to me.  
I'll try to write this as coherent as possible but since english isn't my main language and I seem to have lost all my intelligence, so please forgive me if It starts getting confusing.

So basically, I have no idea what to do, my depression is getting so bad that I don't see any other way out besides ending it all. I feel no pleasure what so ever, not even masturbating gives me any pleasure. I feel like shit on a daily basis, from overwhelming sadness, anxiety and rage to paranoia, overwhelming suicidal thoughts and even homicidal thoughts. I don't want to hurt anyone besides myself thought. I'm such a failure, I'm 18 and still a virgin, I'm fat and all the freaking times I joined the gym I found myself just giving up weeks later. I have no social skills, or better yet no skills AT ALL. All my life I was illuded by my teachers, parents and friends into thinking that I was smarter than average, and the worst thing is that was the only good thing I saw on me, but I'm not smart at all, I'm just a dumb piece of shit. I tried everything I could to treat my depression but nothing seems to work, meditation (minimum of 30 minutes per day), medication (multiple antipsychotics, antidepressants and benzodiazepines), psychedelic drugs (LSD, magic mushrooms, DMT, you name it I probably tried it). I go to a psychologist and psychiatrist but I feel no better, probably worse than when it all started, the worst part is that I don't even remember when and how it started. Now I wouldn't say I abuse drugs that much, I mainly smoke a bit of weed every now and then, mostly weekends, and regarding psychedelics I done them rarely and with every bit of damage reduction I could think of, perhaps I did indeed disrespect them a bit (mostly taking them without prior planning leading to uncomfortable sets and settings) since I can't enjoy them anymore, I panic and my mind instantly tells me to take xanax or any benzo I can get my hands on. However I DID abuse Xanax, so much so that I ended up on the hospital a couple times for taking too much of it and blacking out, while in school which just fucked my reputation in school. My friends tried to help me as much as they could, but my mind is so fucked and confused that nothing seems to help. This text is getting long but I still have so much to say, I'll try to not make it too long so you don't get bored quickly. My grades are down the hill, I'm currently in 12th grade and about to fail, and honestly I CAN'T stand another year at that school, I rather hang myself than go through that again, specially since I live in an isolated island in the middle of nowhere and resources are very limited here, there's nothing to do here and there's no chance I'm getting a girlfriend here (or anywhere to be honest, nobody would love a fat piece of shit like me).

Life is unbearable, I see no reason to stay alive, all I do all day is playing fcking LoL and let me tell you I hate that game so much, makes my blood boil and gives me urges to just cut my wrists. I can't make basic math/physics/chemistry/etc.. which just makes me feel even worst, cuz I need it to get to college, but I don't understand shit in school, since I can't study or focus, my mind just bombards me with horrible thoughts that echo in my mind till I put myself to sleep, I have no control over my mind anymore. I started learning guitar, and ended up giving up. I tried to learn how to program, but It's too overwhelming and I'm starting to lose any motivation I had for it (not that I had much motivation in general).

Here's some backstory, when I was a kid I got shot in my eye with a air pressure carabine, which left me with about 10% vision on said eye, made me get fat cuz I couldn't do exercise for about 2-3 years and I ended up getting a bad lifestyle in general, all day in computer playing games. This combined with more trauma I went throught and my midly toxic family, lead to me becoming the disgusting person I could think of. I know this is getting too much information and confusing please forgive me, I'm retarded.

Right now all I can think of is how to kill myself, I've tried it before with pills but ended up failing, so this time I'm thinking of hanging myself, and will do it eventually.

,SuicideWatch,"I hate who I am. I've lived a perfectly good life, had loving parents, was never bullied, whatever. Right now I have plenty of friends, a decent social life. I have no excuse for feeling how I feel and I just constantly beat myself up for it. Yet here we are, me just doing drugs every night and eating shitty food in the hopes that they'll kill me faster. Pretty much given up on college, no clue how I'm ever gonna graduate, but not like it matters since I'm not doing anything with my life anyway. Next phase is to get some dead end job till death finally comes. Not much to look forward to. Would have offed myself long ago if it wasn't for my parents, I can't give them the pain of losing their only child to suicide. I also don't wanna hurt my friends, but I'm doing a pretty good job of distancing myself from them so that probably won't be an issue in the future. Living for others sucks, but I mean, what other choice do I have?  I'm definitely not gonna live for myself when the time comes.

So here I am just patiently waiting death. For the most part I've stopped feeling anything. Some days (today) it just hits me like a train, but I usually wake up, just lumber through the whole day doing what's ""expected"" of me, all fake smiles and funny jokes to make people think that I'm normal. Then I come back, waste time with videos games or drugs, sleep, rinse and repeat. I've tried to start a hobby, but I always lose motivation, try to talk to people, but only exchange empty words. Don't see my condition improving in any way (not like it's possible anyway). Life sucks, it always has and always will. I just really hope that I don't get the chance to make it to 30 years.

I despise this cycle, I hate that you're forced to participate, and I hate that people tell you that you're the one with ""a problem"" for thinking that things shouldn't be this way. Isn't it cruel to keep someone in misery when relief is so easily available? But of course, forcing them to suffer is obviously the moral choice here. So I guess suffer I will, cause apparently society decided that this was the right choice.

I&amp;#39;ve lived a perfectly good life, had loving parents, was never bullied, whatever. Right now I have plenty of friends, a decent social life. I have no excuse for feeling how I feel and I just constantly beat myself up for it. Yet here we are, me just doing drugs every night and eating shitty food in the hopes that they&amp;#39;ll kill me faster. Pretty much given up on college, no clue how I&amp;#39;m ever gonna graduate, but not like it matters since I&amp;#39;m not doing anything with my life anyway. Next phase is to get some dead end job till death finally comes. Not much to look forward to. Would have offed myself long ago if it wasn&amp;#39;t for my parents, I can&amp;#39;t give them the pain of losing their only child to suicide. I also don&amp;#39;t wanna hurt my friends, but I&amp;#39;m doing a pretty good job of distancing myself from them so that probably won&amp;#39;t be an issue in the future. Living for others sucks, but I mean, what other choice do I have?  I&amp;#39;m definitely not gonna live for myself when the time comes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So here I am just patiently waiting death. For the most part I&amp;#39;ve stopped feeling anything. Some days (today) it just hits me like a train, but I usually wake up, just lumber through the whole day doing what&amp;#39;s &amp;quot;expected&amp;quot; of me, all fake smiles and funny jokes to make people think that I&amp;#39;m normal. Then I come back, waste time with videos games or drugs, sleep, rinse and repeat.

,SuicideWatch,"Hey guys,

so this is a throwaway account for reasons...

Anyways, I'm a freshman in high school and overall, I have pretty decent grades and I play violin (since preschool) and do sports. I have an extremely caring an overall amazing boyfriend, and an awesome friend who I basically consider as an older brother.

I have nothing to live for. My mother is verbally abusive, and when I call out for help with the few close friends I have left, she says I'm lying and she'll call me out and ruin my life. Now, I don't even know if I'm lying or not. If I am, just ignore this then. I really don't know anymore. Everyday, I'm so confused. I have no right to be proud of anything, and because I go to a really tough high school, often I don't have the time to practice violin (but I do a lot of competitions and honor orch, etc. so yeah not good) and yanno, college applications are coming up and I don't think I have anything to show. I do homework during class so I can finally relax during lunch, but I tell my mom I do homework during lunch to avoid getting my ass kicked. She compulsively checks my phone and reads my texts (more than I have my phone, her reason is that my parents bought it and not me), goes through my stuff and takes it, then tells me she did nothing of the sort, and yet I'm the crazy horrible reputation ruining liar here. I guess I don't even know if I am?

I'm just so tired of it all. I know that there's things to look forward to and live for, but I feel nothing for it. I've had suicidal thoughts and depression and whatever and my mom is saying I'm lying and making it up. I just don't know what to do, because even though I'm just a teenager, I could probably say my boyfriend is the only person I'd want to spend life with if things work out (I've dated before and so has he). But as of now, I'm giving everyone aneurysms or something dealing with me and getting mad at me. My violin and sports are doing basically nothing because I don't have time or energy and this generation is pretty damn good at this stuff. The only thing keeping me alive is the fact that I know my boyfriend probably would have a really hard time dealing with the fact that I was gone, for a very long time. I've been debating ending the relationship to make it easier on him.

I'm sorry, I don't know what to ask of y'all. Just please help me. I'm talked out. I just don't know anymore. Everytime someone tries to help everything honestly just gets worse.

,SuicideWatch,"Last year I was a freshman in highshighschool. Near the end I was ready. I was gonna do it then one of the people told my mom and got me help. I told 3 people john, alex, and gabriel. Kohn said he would help me but lied. Alex did nothing and gabriel helped me. A few nights ago john texted me. This is our conversation.



John: I know you hate and despise me with a passion, But I must ask, Why? I just kinda needed some clearence. I'm not here to pick a fight with you, but to come to an understanding, So looks like u have spent 10 mins typing, I guess I can expect a bomb drop on me or som.

Me: I was on the verge of suicide and u said u would do something u promised and I hoped deep down someone would I was going to kill my fucking self on the 13 of july that year stab in the heart with a fuckin knife u promised me someone who I dispite all other judgement thought was a good if not the closest friend I had u did nothing u would've let me die it was gabriel the one who I thought wouldn't give a shit because of all the shit we went through it was him who got me the fucking help I hate u so fuck much so so much with all my fucking heart every muscle and bone and tendon and bit of flesh burns with hatred when i even think about u and the worst part is i cant unthink it I cant just forget an entire year cause I fuckin would forget u exist forget the entirety of 8th grade then some more u go around saying oh jay was just faking it he wanted the attention I was going to fuckin die and u were gonna sit there and watch with ur thumb up ur ass like some sorta fuckin beast of the fields then u come back to me and ask what I did wrong why do u hate me like that's a question then ur not even gonna say sorry u weren't just a shitty friend ur a shitty person and I made it my mission now to stop people from making the same mistake I did trusting u fuck I was a goddamn idiot but it doesn't even matter now I know where everyone stands when I asked them to pick a side a while back and they said they were with me only to lie and be with u I know now I only hate 3 things u Hitler and satan and u u didnt even do just that u hit ur brother u shot at me with a bb gun u hit my head with a bat and each time I tried to be a friend have someone by myside thought it would be u guess not then theres ur sarcasm again and I could keep going but ur rushing me so here


John: Well holy shit That was... Okay look man I'm honestly speechless But I need you to understand my perception I thought that you were just up to ur usual antics and I thought u were begging for attention, and I decided to not give you that attention. You aren't gonna believe me but I am honestly truly sorry if you felt and continue to feel this way I mean I never wanted any of this, I was led to believe that you had gone mad and I had to leave it at there Suicide is stupid by the way, I have considered that for myself in the past and I'm telling you it does not go well because those who have acted on that literally destroy their loved ones. You need to understand that I never wanted to hurt you in the way that you felt I just thought it was a bucket of bullshit, but I know realize you needed help Look I wanna clear the air here, I know you'll never consider me friend and that you hate my guts, but I want to make my peace with you and I want you to understand that I never hated you, and I am a man who believes in redemption There's nothing I can do, you clearly are a broken individual, I pray for your healing and I hope god watches you I hope that you seek help and that you talk to someone about this

Me: Horse shit

John: Ik that's what you think

Me: Need I continue Or do u wanna talk in person

John: Look man all I can say is god bless your soul, may his angels watch you, may you be free of this cursed darkness, and if you wanna talk in person I'm totally up for that

Me: Tomorrow freshman bathrooms by the commons around a lunch

John: I have a class I need to attend for and my schedule is kinda tight, but I could tomorrow morning at the main commons or som I believe you and I have a shared friend, Jake Maybe he could be present as we hash things out 

Me: No This is a u and me thing Fuck class

John: Of course, but listen if you wanna reach me, I'm around in the mornings or C lunch period

Me: Fuck that then

John: I kinda got fucked with the tardies rn so... I mean I'm open to discussing with you 

Me: Fuck ok 

John: I just need a time that works for both of us

Me: I'm just gonna say it all here

John: I can get on call if you like?

Me: Cant

John: Aight Then ig you just tell me here

Me: Shortened version 

Beginning of 9th grade I was completely alone u guys who were supposed to be my fuckin friends ran from me knew no one talked to no one only friend I had was jd and hes an ass on his own lowering my self esteem and all this went on for a month finally when I caught hold of u I invited u all to my birthday where everyone fucked off on their own leaving me once again alone to top that off all 3 of u alex gabriel and u tried to leave then homecoming where my past finally caught up to me I met someone we went on a date and it was ok I got to the house only to find some cunt who left the group who u took the place of and he told them everything about me how I hurt people without remorse and how I would so it again and how I was dangerous and shit they knew and I went with them they tried confronting me about it but I lied I hate liars and I lied to make that worse she was with someone else and I couldn't do shit about it when I go over to look for u bing notification everyone except me with the caption only friends I need or something I didnt have a ride home so I went back each question getting more and more personal until my dad came where I had to lie to him too and mom I knew I was alone then thought for a while then the idea slipped in for all but a second talked myself out ended the semester kicked out of 4 groups and our relationship starting to tear

Second half dad beat me mom beat me I wasnt doing well anywhere I went I was getting called a school shooter mick was getting away with everything and I was constantly at the bottom always mom thinks I'm gay humiliates me to the point of breaking down telling her I'm not only to find out later she didnt believe me start to lose friends over time get kicked out of sam billings table and im alone idea slips in I think on it for a bit longer before talking myself out again dad moves to Arizona leaving mom stressed jd convinces me I'm not a good person I give him a peice of my mind we dont talk for a bit I get in a fight lose and get made fun of for it the idea is set now stuck in my head I'm going to do this i need to mom humiliates me further but apologizes I know it's fake I say to myself I should probably tell the fuckers so they aren't blindsided gabriel snitches later that night and I have a difficult conversation with mom concerning my mental health I go to therapy over the summer

This year I come to school knowing jake over summer hoping I have at least lunch but no I no nobody I'm alone again I see Sam's tables broken up over schedules I say not again and assemble what I can every other persons telling me I'm gay kill myself or something I know I need to keep loving myself even if I'm alone then I get word that u were telling people I  was saying I was going to kill myself for attention then the switch flipped I hate u always will I will never forgive u gabriel or alex never I bullshat my way into Jake's friend Austin's life stayed there expanded my group 

Now after thinking to myself why I'm even trying I realize u dont care ur a self centered asshole I had my fair share of toxicity but u took the cake and it was my fault for inviting u to the table now I see some freshman showing the same mannerisms as u and I know I need to stop it because u were a good friend but then u stopped and I dont understand that I don't get it why it doesn't matter the only one u care about is u and u will do anything to make sure u are ok or u come out on top like u have been but it doesn't matter I have the first real friend I had in a while a trustworthy group of friends and a gf lifes uphill only problem is u and I'm stuck on that cant shake it u aren't a good person idk if its u lashing out because of the divorce or u just think ur better than others or what anyways every part of my body wants u to burn in hell 
If that's too much to read listen to creep humility and magic city

John: I finished it all It was alot but I read it I don't what to say So you think I'm some narcisstic prick So much self pity man, and I have to say this really isnt healthy 

Me: Typical I said what I had to

John: You may not be able to forgive me, but you need to understand that this is not how any human being should live I wouldnt wish how you feel on my worst enemy

Me: I look for the good in everything I cant find any in u I said what i had to

John: I know Again you may think I'm some prideful narcisstic son on a bitch, but I do care about people, especially for those who are broken

Me: U are Look in a mirror and think long and hard about urself

John: I mean thats only how you view me There are millions of ways different people who see you You think I'm a bad man, and I accept your thoughts, I mean thats not who I am, but if thats the picture you painted then I'm sorry

Me: I'm an asshole that's how 80% of people see me and I'm ok with that But ask any one

John: My advice to you is find a light, be free, never let the pain, the darkness determine who you are

Me: Tell them answer honestly Dont therapize me

John: I'm happy that you met Jake, he is a truly great friend and is very supportive, I'm glad that you have someone like him in your life

Me: Fuck off with ur therapeutic bullshit

John: I'm not being your therapist, but the more you hang on to this hate and anger, than life will just be a major bummer I mean ur stubborn man

Me: Thing is I want to forgive and forget But I cant

John: And you can Thats ur choice

Me: U may be sorry now

John: U can let go of it all

Me: But that doesn't fix what ubdid U did*

John: What I did? Its all in ur head

Me:  I will never forgive u

John: You painted this fucked up picture of me

Me: Or alex Or gabriel I will not because theres no good in u We all see ourselves as saints and our enemies as devils

John: I'm not your enemy

Me: To me ur just the shittyiest of shitty people U are John U are

John: Than thats a u problem

Me: U were about to let me die After u promised to be with me Then u lie

John: First of all suicide is an option and I never advised you to do that

Me: I told u And gabriel And alex Only u 3

John: What was I supposed to do?  Did you want me to call a hotline or som?

Me: U were supposed to be my friend Just be my friend But u didnt and u cant and u won't

John: I wanted to be your friend, and I'm sorry that I decided to not even say anything That I took ur claims as an attention stunt

Me: U say sorry now because I explained U arent Dont kid urself 

John: Your in a dark dark place, and I feel very sorry for you, your broken and fucked up and all I can do is wish you the best Jay

Me: Were I'm not anymore I was in a dark place Things are fucked up Yes but that's gonna help later Gammbette jay gammbette and be kensuki Words I tell myself every morning Gammbette do your best in try in Japanese Kensuki the art of using gold to repair broken things Ik I'm broken but I'm fixing myself Something I would recommend u do

John: I'm happy for you

Me: No u fuckin aren't

John: Think what you want

Near the end I was ready. I was gonna do it then one of the people told my mom and got me help. I told 3 people john, alex, and gabriel. Kohn said he would help me but lied. Alex did nothing and gabriel helped me. A few nights ago john texted me. This is our conversation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;John: I know you hate and despise me with a passion, But I must ask, Why? I just kinda needed some clearence. I&amp;#39;m not here to pick a fight with you, but to come to an understanding, So looks like u have spent 10 mins typing, I guess I can expect a bomb drop on me or som.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Me: I was on the verge of suicide and u said u would do something u promised and I hoped deep down someone would I was going to kill my fucking self on the 13 of july that year stab in the heart with a fuckin knife u promised me someone who I dispite all other judgement thought was a good if not the closest friend I had u did nothing u would&amp;#39;ve let me die it was gabriel the one who I thought wouldn&amp;#39;t give a shit because of all the shit we went through it was him who got me the fucking help I hate u so fuck much so so much with all my fucking heart every muscle and bone and tendon and bit of flesh burns with hatred when i even think about u and the worst part is i cant unthink it I cant just forget an entire year cause I fuckin would forget u exist forget the entirety of 8th grade then some more u go around saying oh jay was just faking it he wanted the attention I was going to fuckin die and u were gonna sit there and watch with ur thumb up ur ass like some sorta fuckin beast of the fields then u come back to me and ask what I did wrong why do u hate me like that&amp;#39;s a question then ur not even gonna say sorry u weren&amp;#39;t just a shitty friend ur a shitty person and I made it my mission now to stop people from making the same mistake I did trusting u fuck I was a goddamn idiot but it doesn&amp;#39;t even matter now I know where everyone stands when I asked them to pick a side a while back and they said they were with me only to lie and be with u I know now I only hate 3 things u Hitler and satan and u u didnt even do just that u hit ur brother u shot at me with a bb gun u hit my head with a bat and each time I tried to be a friend have someone by myside thought it would be u guess not then theres ur sarcasm again and I could keep going but ur rushing me so here&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;John: Well holy shit That was... Okay look man I&amp;#39;m honestly speechless But I need you to understand my perception I thought that you were just up to ur usual antics and I thought u were begging for attention, and I decided to not give you that attention. You aren&amp;#39;t gonna believe me but I am honestly truly sorry if you felt and continue to feel this way I mean I never wanted any of this, I was led to believe that you had gone mad and I had to leave it at there Suicide is stupid by the way, I have considered that for myself in the past and I&amp;#39;m telling you it does not go well because those who have acted on that literally destroy their loved ones. You need to understand that I never wanted to hurt you in the way that you felt I just thought it was a bucket of bullshit, but I know realize you needed help Look I wanna clear the air here, I know you&amp;#39;ll never consider me friend and that you hate my guts, but I want to make my peace with you and I want you to understand that I never hated you, and I am a man who believes in redemption There&amp;#39;s nothing I can do, you clearly are a broken individual, I pray for your healing and I hope god watches you I hope that you seek help and that you talk to someone about this&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Me: Horse shit&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;John: Ik that&amp;#39;s what you think&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Me: Need I continue Or do u wanna talk in person&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;John: Look man all I can say is god bless your soul, may his angels watch you, may you be free of this cursed darkness, and if you wanna talk in person I&amp;#39;m totally up for that&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Me: Tomorrow freshman bathrooms by the commons around a lunch&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;John: I can get on call if you like?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Me: Cant&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;John: Aight Then ig you just tell me here&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Me: Shortened version &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beginning of 9th grade I was completely alone u guys who were supposed to be my fuckin friends ran from me knew no one talked to no one only friend I had was jd and hes an ass on his own lowering my self esteem and all this went on for a month finally when I caught hold of u I invited u all to my birthday where everyone fucked off on their own leaving me once again alone to top that off all 3 of u alex gabriel and u tried to leave then homecoming where my past finally caught up to me I met someone we went on a date and it was ok I got to the house only to find some cunt who left the group who u took the place of and he told them everything about me how I hurt people without remorse and how I would so it again and how I was dangerous and shit they knew and I went with them they tried confronting me about it but I lied I hate liars and I lied to make that worse she was with someone else and I couldn&amp;#39;t do shit about it when I go over to look for u bing notification everyone except me with the caption only friends I need or something I didnt have a ride home so I went back each question getting more and more personal until my dad came where I had to lie to him too and mom I knew I was alone then thought for a while then the idea slipped in for all but a second talked myself out ended the semester kicked out of 4 groups and our relationship starting to tear&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Second half dad beat me mom beat me I wasnt doing well anywhere I went I was getting called a school shooter mick was getting away with everything and I was constantly at the bottom always mom thinks I&amp;#39;m gay humiliates me to the point of breaking down telling her I&amp;#39;m not only to find out later she didnt believe me start to lose friends over time get kicked out of sam billings table and im alone idea slips in I think on it for a bit longer before talking myself out again dad moves to Arizona leaving mom stressed jd convinces me I&amp;#39;m not a good person I give him a peice of my mind we dont talk for a bit I get in a fight lose and get made fun of for it the idea is set now stuck in my head I&amp;#39;m going to do this i need to mom humiliates me further but apologizes I know it&amp;#39;s fake I say to myself I should probably tell the fuckers so they aren&amp;#39;t blindsided gabriel snitches later that night and I have a difficult conversation with mom concerning my mental health I go to therapy over the summer&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This year I come to school knowing jake over summer hoping I have at least lunch but no I no nobody I&amp;#39;m alone again I see Sam&amp;#39;s tables broken up over schedules I say not again and assemble what I can every other persons telling me I&amp;#39;m gay kill myself or something I know I need to keep loving myself even if I&amp;#39;m alone then I get word that u were telling people I  was saying I was going to kill myself for attention then the switch flipped I hate u always will I will never forgive u gabriel or alex never I bullshat my way into Jake&amp;#39;s friend Austin&amp;#39;s life stayed there expanded my group &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now after thinking to myself why I&amp;#39;m even trying I realize u dont care ur a self centered asshole I had my fair share of toxicity but u took the cake and it was my fault for inviting u to the table now I see some freshman showing the same mannerisms as u and I know I need to stop it because u were a good friend but then u stopped and I dont understand that I don&amp;#39;t get it why it doesn&amp;#39;t matter the only one u care about is u and u will do anything to make sure u are ok or u come out on top like u have been but it doesn&amp;#39;t matter I have the first real friend I had in a while a trustworthy group of friends and a gf lifes uphill only problem is u and I&amp;#39;m stuck on that cant shake it u aren&amp;#39;t a good person idk if its u lashing out because of the divorce or u just think ur better than others or what anyways every part of my body wants u to burn in hell 
If that&amp;#39;s too much to read listen to creep humility and magic city&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;John: I finished it all It was alot but I read it I don&amp;#39;t what to say So you think I&amp;#39;m some narcisstic prick So much self pity man, and I have to say this really isnt healthy &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Me: Typical I said what I had to&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;John: You may not be able to forgive me, but you need to understand that this is not how any human being should live I wouldnt wish how you feel on my worst enemy&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Me: I look for the good in everything I cant find any in u I said what i had to&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;John: I know Again you may think I&amp;#39;m some prideful narcisstic son on a bitch, but I do care about people, especially for those who are broken&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Me: U are Look in a mirror and think long and hard about urself&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;John: I mean thats only how you view me There are millions of ways different people who see you You think I&amp;#39;m a bad man, and I accept your thoughts, I mean thats not who I am, but if thats the picture you painted then I&amp;#39;m sorry&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Me: I&amp;#39;m an asshole that&amp;#39;s how 80% of people see me and I&amp;#39;m ok with that But ask any one&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;John: My advice to you is find a light, be free, never let the pain, the darkness determine who you are&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Me: Tell them answer honestly Dont therapize me&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;John: I&amp;#39;m happy that you met Jake, he is a truly great friend and is very supportive, I&amp;#39;m glad that you have someone like him in your life&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Me: Fuck off with ur therapeutic bullshit&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;John: I&amp;#39;m not being your therapist, but the more you hang on to this hate and anger, than life will just be a major bummer I mean ur stubborn man&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Me: Thing is I want to forgive and forget But I cant&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;John: And you can Thats ur choice&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Me: U may be sorry now&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;John: U can let go of it all&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Me: But that doesn&amp;#39;t fix what ubdid U did*&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;John: What I did? Its all in ur head&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Me:  I will never forgive u&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;John: You painted this fucked up picture of me&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Me: Or alex Or gabriel I will not because theres no good in u We all see ourselves as saints and our enemies as devils&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;John: I&amp;#39;m not your enemy&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Me: To me ur just the shittyiest of shitty people U are John U are&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;John: Than thats a u problem&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Me: U were about to let me die After u promised to be with me Then u lie&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;John: First of all suicide is an option and I never advised you to do that&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Me: I told u And gabriel And alex Only u 3&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;John: What was I supposed to do?  Did you want me to call a hotline or som?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Me: U were supposed to be my friend Just be my friend But u didnt and u cant and u won&amp;#39;t&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;John: I wanted to be your friend, and I&amp;#39;m sorry that I decided to not even say anything That I took ur claims as an attention stunt&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Me: U say sorry now because I explained U arent Dont kid urself &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;John: Your in a dark dark place, and I feel very sorry for you, your broken and fucked up and all I can do is wish you the best Jay&lt;/p&gt;

,SuicideWatch,"I'm nearly 23 years old. My father abandoned our family when I was 14. He was my best friend at the time... I haven't seen him in 6 years. This void made me become extremely close to my few friends. My clinginess reached a point where they got fed up from me and my anxiety and paranoia, that I've now lost my closest friends. I used to reach out to them for help, but it reached a point where everything was on their shoulders and they couldn't handle it anymore, so they distanced themselves with time.  
I used to be more fit and more attractive, but my life has taken a downwards spiral. I've gained about 70 lbs and my self-consciousness eats me up on the inside. My anxiety is through the roof and I have no motivation to do anything anymore. I'm on anxiety meds but truly think I should be on anti-depressants. I am now failing out of school and I don't have the heart to tell my mother. It will break her, but also I know that once she finds out, my life will probably turn into more of a hell, as she's always had extremely high standards for me. 

I'm still a virgin. I've never had a girlfriend. I was seeing this girl when I was 17, but that was about it. And that was at my peak attractiveness. It is now laughable how unattractive I am. People will literally laugh at me because of my appearance. My self-confidence is inexistent. I get anxiety attacks when people just look at me because I think that they are judging me on how I look. I can't deal with this anymore.

I moved away from my hometown 3 years ago for university. I haven't made a single new friend. I live alone. I literally don't use my voice anymore because I have no one to talk to. It reaches the point where I talk to myself because I'm scared that if I go without talking for so long that I will lose my voice. The only time I used to use my voice was while playing video-games online, it was the only thing that brought me a bit of joy. But my console broke, and I can't afford to fix it.

I have no ambitions. I don't know what I want to do in life. Everyone around me seems to have it figured out. Meanwhile, I'm a loser that is eating his life away. The only future I envision having is honestly the one where I throw myself off of my apartment building. I think about just ending it all the time. 

I feel alone in this world, and I don't have the motivation nor the self-confidence to do anything about it.

I want to kill myself, I just want to fall asleep and never wake up.",t2_39m5cya3,False,,0,False,This is why I want to kill myself... Considering doing it tonight,[],r/SuicideWatch,False,0,,0,False,t3_fdo69f,False,dark,,public,2,0,{},,False,[],,False,False,,{},,False,2,,False,,False,,[],{},,True,,1583403418.0,text,0,,,text,self.SuicideWatch,False,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m nearly 23 years old. My father abandoned our family when I was 14. He was my best friend at the time... I haven&amp;#39;t seen him in 6 years. This void made me become extremely close to my few friends. My clinginess reached a point where they got fed up from me and my anxiety and paranoia, that I&amp;#39;ve now lost my closest friends. I used to reach out to them for help, but it reached a point where everything was on their shoulders and they couldn&amp;#39;t handle it anymore, so they distanced themselves with time.&lt;br/&gt;
I used to be more fit and more attractive, but my life has taken a downwards spiral. I&amp;#39;ve gained about 70 lbs and my self-consciousness eats me up on the inside. My anxiety is through the roof and I have no motivation to do anything anymore. I&amp;#39;m on anxiety meds but truly think I should be on anti-depressants. I am now failing out of school and I don&amp;#39;t have the heart to tell my mother. It will break her, but also I know that once she finds out, my life will probably turn into more of a hell, as she&amp;#39;s always had extremely high standards for me. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m still a virgin. I&amp;#39;ve never had a girlfriend. I was seeing this girl when I was 17, but that was about it. And that was at my peak attractiveness. It is now laughable how unattractive I am. People will literally laugh at me because of my appearance. My self-confidence is inexistent. I get anxiety attacks when people just look at me because I think that they are judging me on how I look. I can&amp;#39;t deal with this anymore.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I moved away from my hometown 3 years ago for university. I haven&amp;#39;t made a single new friend. I live alone. I literally don&amp;#39;t use my voice anymore because I have no one to talk to. It reaches the point where I talk to myself because I&amp;#39;m scared that if I go without talking for so long that I will lose my voice. The only time I used to use my voice was while playing video-games online, it was the only thing that brought me a bit of joy. But my console broke, and I can&amp;#39;t afford to fix it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have no ambitions. I don&amp;#39;t know what I want to do in life. Everyone around me seems to have it figured out. Meanwhile, I&amp;#39;m a loser that is eating his life away. The only future I envision having is honestly the one where I throw myself off of my apartment building. I think about just ending it all the time. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I feel alone in this world, and I don&amp;#39;t have the motivation nor the self-confidence to do anything about it. The only people that may care about me are the couple family members I have, but I have put them under so much shit for all of the stuff I&amp;#39;ve done in the past that they are fed up with me. I want to kill myself, I just want to fall asleep and never wake up.&lt;/p&gt;

I love someone dearly who has attempted suicide more than once and been hospitalized after their attempts. They also struggle with addiction.

I’ve also lost someone I love to suicide. 

They’ve called me, more than once, often drunk or high, sometimes not, telling me goodbye, this was the end, and this was their plan (I don’t know if specific phrases are allowed, so to generalize, the gist is I have all I need to kill myself readily accessible/I am in the location where I’m going to kill my self and when we hang up I’m going to do it) 

Sometimes, I’m close enough that I can physically go to be with them. Sometimes I’m not. 

Every time, I feel like their life is in my hands. That’s not a responsibility I feel like I can handle. If something were to happen to them, I’d feel entirely responsible.

,SuicideWatch,"Similar story here, OP. In my case my dad spent my childhood promising to *help* me pursue a science career if I moved in with him, along with many other exorbitant promises. He then coaxed me into signing my life savings over to him under the guise of him teaching me money management skills. Afterwards his personality instantly changed like he had been replaced with a body snatcher:

He started holding my money hostage to control me. He forced me into a flat earth fundamentalist church. He started incessantly discouraging my scientific interests. I was forbidden from me from even being seen with a girl since it might lead others to think we were sexually active. He threatened to cut me off if I ever associated with members of so many demographics that I was functionally unable to have friends. He would scream at me and belittle and humiliate me for hours every day. His church was so strict that I had to give up most of my hobbies for being ""sinful"". He tried to damage my relationships with all of my other family members. He would constantly follow me around and would incessantly act out for attention so much that I struggled to even attempt my schoolwork or even my remaining hobbies. I was quickly so psychologically broken that I started failing my classes despite growing up an honors student. 

A few years later, I took on a second major hoping to raise my GPA and just barely squeak into grad school. Dad took this to somehow mean that I was ""on the verge of graduating with two PhDs"". He completely flipped from incessantly discouraging me to exerting 24/7 pressure to graduate with those two PhDs *immediately*. I explained over and over that I wasn't getting two PhDs, but he wouldn't accept it. Despite my protests he spread word far and wide about my ""two PhDs"" and I gained a reputation as some kind of miracle prodigy that I could never actually live up to. By this point Dad was in the final stages of terminal heart problems and was so relentless in his pressure that I started going along with it because even after all his years of lies and abuse I didn't want to disappoint him on his death bed.

Years went by and things continued to get worse for me. I was overwhelmed with preemptive grief over dad's impending death every day. I went through a traumatic religious deconversion and lost my soul-sustaining (nonfundamentalist) faith in God. I started experiencing severe diabetes symptoms. I was struggling with the increased course load and failing to recover my grades as Dad continued to sink deeper and deeper into an obsession with those completely imaginary PhDs. One day dad started taking me to visit some old man from his crazy cult who was bedridden from his own terminal heart problems. 

More years went by and both dad and the old guy were both alive. That meant that Dad had been in the final stages of terminal illness for something like 6 years. I realized that he had been outrageously exaggerating his health problems and that I had spent the last several of them going along with his delusional nonsense

He completely flipped from incessantly discouraging me to exerting 24/7 pressure to graduate with those two PhDs &lt;em&gt;immediately&lt;/em&gt;. I explained over and over that I wasn&amp;#39;t getting two PhDs, but he wouldn&amp;#39;t accept it. Despite my protests he spread word far and wide about my &amp;quot;two PhDs&amp;quot; and I gained a reputation as some kind of miracle prodigy that I could never actually live up to. By this point Dad was in the final stages of terminal heart problems and was so relentless in his pressure that I started going along with it because even after all his years of lies and abuse I didn&amp;#39;t want to disappoint him on his death bed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Years went by and things continued to get worse for me. I was overwhelmed with preemptive grief over dad&amp;#39;s impending death every day. I went through a traumatic religious deconversion and lost my soul-sustaining (nonfundamentalist) faith in God. I started experiencing severe diabetes symptoms. I was struggling with the increased course load and failing to recover my grades as Dad continued to sink deeper and deeper into an obsession with those completely imaginary PhDs. One day dad started taking me to visit some old man from his crazy cult who was bedridden from his own terminal heart problems. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More years went by and both dad and the old guy were both alive. That meant that Dad had been in the final stages of terminal illness for something like 6 years. I realized that he had been outrageously exaggerating his health problems and that I had spent the last several of them going along with his delusional nonsense&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fuck it, I&amp;#39;m tired. It hurts so much. It hurts so much.&lt;/p&gt;

There have been elements of abuse in the past and I dont think I can fully trust anyone, so I have to do this or die or get a high paying job without a degree or hurting my back(I have a terrible back and neurological problems) I'll be left with something like stripping, or just suicide.

&amp;nbsp;

At this point, classes are getting more intense, I'm already behind in an online class that posted no deadlines, because I'm prioritizing a class in which I work around 30 hours/week to keep my quality high(I'm aiming for A's and this class is supposedly graded harshly-so far I have A's and 1 B on something I worked on for just 10 hours). Anyway, so I am behind in my online classes now, trying to make time to catch up, but seems impossible.  

&amp;nbsp;

My other in person class doesn't take as much time, I have a 4 hour studio and homework takes me maybe 1-5 hours usually. I have trouble managing time because I hardly see my SO, so when we do see each other, we stay up late and just play games. We havent had any intimacy in about a month, and otherwise it's like a 1-2x/month thing. He doesn't help me with the chores unless I ask a bunch of times even though i made a chore chart for us both to look at,on the fridge, and gave myself more things. He keeps promising he'll do chores,shower,brush his teeth, just basic things, and he doesn't. He actually said he'd do all the chores when I went back to school(like I'd done for him) and not to worry. I worried, but I left things for a bit and realized I was correct in being concerned after the house started looking trashed. If I talk to him he changes the topic or recites some meme. He kisses me maybe twice a day and is otherwise glued to his phone watching YouTube videos- he quit video games as they were time consuming but just switched to videos instead. He's so addicted to his phone that he got his by a bus last year, while I was passenger. He's usually on his phone while driving and there's nothing I can do. I dont drive because of my anxiety, and I dont have a working car. I am very stressed right now and feel totally alone. 
&amp;nbsp;

I literally dont have time to see a therapist. I dont even have time to see my doctors for checkups. All I do is work, at school,homework,and at home. I am painfully shy and awkward and have no friends. I've joined a few clubs to make friends but it seems impossible; people try to befriend me it seems, and I just don't know how to interact.  I had an amazing conversation with another top performer in my class with the difficult work and anticipated becoming friends- she tries, but I dont know how to reciprocate and I can tell that I make things uncomfortable because I react as if we never started forming a friendship, if that makes sense. 

&amp;nbsp;

In my other class there is one kid who has tried to befriend me. He has autism and comes across pretty brash. I try to remind myself that he has a condition and to not take things personally, but sometimes I can't help it and I feel terrible and other times he is just too close and I feel awkward. I think he seems genuinely friendly and most of the time I dont mind him, but I guess I'm just under so much stress at this point that everything is getting to me. The whole class is also pretty distracting, which again, is usually bearable but the stress is wearing me out and there's 0 things I can do to relieve it.

&amp;nbsp;

Yesterday I got a grade back from a quiz and just a friendly note to try to speak up more during critique(I'm a design student, so this is an art class). I made a mental note to make sure to speak up during critique last night, and then I panicked. First I panicked because I wanted to be done my painting beforehand- I hadn't planned properly and am always the slow one in everything, so I kept messing up and didn't finish in time. It seemed I was one of 2 others who hadn't finished so that made me feel a little better. Critique came and the aforementioned kid stood next to me as he always does, uncomfortably close, and then in front of me and I couldn't see the paintings. Panic increased and I didn't want to be rude so I didn't say anything. I planned for what shouldve been my painting for critique and was called out of order and further panicked. 
&amp;nbsp;

I have a disorder that causes dissociation under stress and I have social anxiety. So when I panic, my mind goes blank. This happened a few days ago; my dog is unfortunately aggressive with 1 dog in my neighborhood. She is a strong dog and fortunately until this point, it had only been my bf who had experienced this. She lunged at the dog and I wasnt strong enough to pull her back, I panicked,mind went blank, and I just stood there. In my mind, the only thing i could think was like, the idea or feeling of alarm, but I couldn't speak or move. The neighbor didn't seem to mind and gave the dogs treats, but I felt so terrible. I don't know how to fix this.

&amp;nbsp;

During the critique, my mind was blank and I didn't know what to say. I absorbed things others had said, but my mind flushed them out when I tried to speak. Speaking and thinking at the same time is difficult for me. I guess I'm just stupid. I usually think for a long time before I speak, and I can think and write, but I dont know how to think+speak quickly or at once. I just felt like crying and couldn't wait to just pack up and start on my drawing assignment(until I realized I'd forgotten my most important supplies).

&amp;nbsp;

I grew up with abusive parents. My dad was pretty absent, working a lot, but when he was home he was a complete ass. He would constantly provoke me. My older brother harshly picked on me. My mom did the most damage, somehow. I grew up thinking she was ""good cop"", she taught me to think that. She could do no wrong, she was perfect, she was always right. If she was upset with me, even if seemingly unreasonable, I did mental gymnastics with myself to justify it. Example: I didn't intervene in her argument with my dad over finances which 6 year old me didn't understand? I'm a bad person who doesn't love mom. 
Moms in the bathroom the 8th time this week with razor blades? I'd be her psychiatrist and beg her to come out,reason with her why she should. Eventually I realized I didn't have to say anything. Eventually still, I realized that I could probably leave because she would just come out soon anyway. I did once, around 6 or 7 and I guess she talked and I didn't respond, so she came literally running after me, cornered me, and yelled down at me for not loving her.
&amp;nbsp;
I have an eating disorder? 
I'm ""evil"", I'm a ""dirty slut"" even though I'm not allowed out of the house- this must be because of how I look or something I've done- am I that person? Mom says so, so i guess so. 
&amp;nbsp;
As a young child, I was mostly raised by my grandparents nextdoor and would sleep over at their house often. I'd cry myself to sleep every night because I thought my mom was mad at me. Every day, I'd be to blame for something. Once, I even got blamed for my dad losing $100. I don't even know why. My mom yelled from up at our back door to down at the yard at me, with the neighborhood kids all outside, telling me I'd better bring the $100 back right now. So then my friends assumed I was a thief(cause a 9 y/o who can't drive and never goes anywhere has a reason for money is definitely wont get caught with random money at some point 🙄). 

&amp;nbsp;

At some point, around 9, I started self harming because I didn't understand what I had apparently done. I was upset for always being such an apparent major cause of my mother's pain- the person I did love most in the world no matter what she thought.

&amp;nbsp;

My parents destroyed my education as an ongoing argument for the funsies I guess. I planned to graduate at 15 or 16 and GTFO. I was physically bullied at school to the point of having my arms near broken every day. I begged to be homeschooled- my plan was to be able to focus on my schooling without bullies and graduate early to get away from my family. I was in 2nd grade my first year homeschooling and skipped up to grade 5 work in everything but math, which I got up to maybe grade 3 which was equivalent to my current grade in public school work. My parents would argue about public and homeschooling and switch me back and forth at least once a school semester. So I'd be in public school in august for a few months, then homeschooled. Obviously this ruined my extra work I'd done and I became discouraged. In 7th grade, I began having a lot of trouble with math. My mom refused to help me, saying I had learning disability and just couldn't learn so to not do it(and then help my lovely, psychotic step sister instead). She'd do this to me at public school too, and I'd often go in humiliated having to explain that I couldn't finish my homework. 

&amp;nbsp;

At one point, I wasn't allowed outside(my grandparents had moved in) and due to that and all the stress, I embraced being reclusive. I told myself I wanted to be that way and whenever people would think it was odd, my mom would huff back at them before I could speak, saying that not everyone has to have friends.

&amp;nbsp;

And now I'm this. Looking back, I remember my dad telling me that my mom coddled me too much and kept me from other people, wanting me all to herself. At the time I thought it was ridiculous, but now I see he was right; she needed me to soothe her, to blame for everything, to be there in misery with her. 
&amp;nbsp;

I got older, decided that I wanted to try being social, so I'd say yes to every single opportunity. Every one. That was a terrible idea and I ended up being abused by a few predatory opportunists, which in turn caused me major anxiety, more than ever before, and I became more reclusive than ever before. I havent held a stable job in a while. Havent had friends since that time, about 10 years ago. I've been with my SO, who has been abusive off and on. Things were great for a few years until we moved out a few years ago, and now they've been very off and on. For a few years again, things have been pretty good as far as that goes, but obviously not having time and not feeling effort from the other person feels shitty too. 

&amp;nbsp;

A couple years ago I found myself in a terrible situation with him and decided my options were prostitution, stripping, drugs, or suicide. I mass applied to jobs but when I'd receive a response, I was never qualified for anything but retail which I've had bad experiences with and it doesn't pay enough. I stopped eating, became an alcoholic with the little funds I had, and attempted suicide somewhere near 3 times a week on average for a few months straight. I almost succeeded once and then my bf unexpectedly came home early and I was sent to the hospital. Things didn't get better when I got out, I threw away my antidepressants since my feelings felt inappropriate in relation to my thoughts and situation, and resumed weekly attempts. Otherwise I'd just lie in bed and try not to get up for fear of killing myself.

&amp;nbsp;

2017 and 2018 sucked. Last year got a little better and by the end of the year I decided to go back to school. I decided rather abruptly and didn't have time to seek diagnosis for learning disabilities, which I think I obviously have. I have a diagnosis of anxiety disorders and recurrent major depressive disorder but I've assumed I wouldn't receive any accommodations for those because.. what can be done?

&amp;nbsp;

Instead I've tried plowing through my feelings and intentionally making myself uncomfortable by joining clubs and going to campus in person, but I'm not adjusting as quickly as I'd hoped. And in the real world, I will have to talk, I will have to have social skills. No one cares about you in the real world. I'm old and have already exposed myself to that in the many job fields I've attempted, so I'm aware. 

&amp;nbsp;

I just feel like I'm a failure. And now I'm overloading myself and I dont want to back down, but idk how to deal with everything and get no help, and have nothing outside of school and working at home. I need a good balance, but I have literally no way of making that happen. I'm in a club that meets once a week, the paper which is 1x a month, and now a new club that no one showed up for, so I became club leader. This will force me into social situations, and I hope that I can do it. In my head I'm telling myself to just do it, so I try, and I talk, and garbage comes out. And I'm older than everyone else, so it's awkward. I'm not supposed to be so immature and stupid by social standards. 

&amp;nbsp;

I feel like I'm just not going to make it. I have straight A's but I feel like I don't deserve them. My art never looks good to me even after spending hours working. I need to make this work but I dont know how. I dont know how to change who I've been for 29 years, in an instant, but I desperately want to. I want to be different, I dont want to be who I am anymore. In the meantime, I'm trying to squeeze in time with my SO and getting very little sleep. Most of it is just time in the same room not even interacting or talking or anything and I feel really void of any affection and social interaction right now, as well as anything fun. I used to walk every day- it's something that lessens the frequency of nerve pain and I dont even have time for that. The weather has been shit anyway. I dont find gaming fun, I don't like to sit, but that's all I'm doing. I'm exhausted. 

&amp;nbsp;

I dont even know what I'm getting at anymore with this. I'm just frustrated with life. Everything is dull,I'm over stressed,lonely, and I honestly just hate myself. Everything about myself is awful, I really hate who I am. I became really sick in the first few weeks of school and have had bronchitis for about 3-4 weeks. It's getting better but I feel like that happening really fucked a lot up for me since I had no energy. I dont know how to manage everything or how to socialize. I feel like I should just kill myself but I dont know how to even do it properly in a way that wont be totally awful. I'm looking to get away from pain and if the last minutes of my life could at least be peaceful that would be, well, ideal.

She lunged at the dog and I wasnt strong enough to pull her back, I panicked,mind went blank, and I just stood there. In my mind, the only thing i could think was like, the idea or feeling of alarm, but I couldn&amp;#39;t speak or move. The neighbor didn&amp;#39;t seem to mind and gave the dogs treats, but I felt so terrible. I don&amp;#39;t know how to fix this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During the critique, my mind was blank and I didn&amp;#39;t know what to say. I absorbed things others had said, but my mind flushed them out when I tried to speak. Speaking and thinking at the same time is difficult for me. I guess I&amp;#39;m just stupid. I usually think for a long time before I speak, and I can think and write, but I dont know how to think+speak quickly or at once. I just felt like crying and couldn&amp;#39;t wait to just pack up and start on my drawing assignment(until I realized I&amp;#39;d forgotten my most important supplies).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I grew up with abusive parents. My dad was pretty absent, working a lot, but when he was home he was a complete ass. He would constantly provoke me. My older brother harshly picked on me. My mom did the most damage, somehow. I grew up thinking she was &amp;quot;good cop&amp;quot;, she taught me to think that. She could do no wrong, she was perfect, she was always right. If she was upset with me, even if seemingly unreasonable, I did mental gymnastics with myself to justify it. Example: I didn&amp;#39;t intervene in her argument with my dad over finances which 6 year old me didn&amp;#39;t understand? I&amp;#39;m a bad person who doesn&amp;#39;t love mom. 
Moms in the bathroom the 8th time this week with razor blades? I&amp;#39;d be her psychiatrist and beg her to come out,reason with her why she should. Eventually I realized I didn&amp;#39;t have to say anything. Eventually still, I realized that I could probably leave because she would just come out soon anyway. I did once, around 6 or 7 and I guess she talked and I didn&amp;#39;t respond, so she came literally running after me, cornered me, and yelled down at me for not loving her.
&amp;nbsp;
I have an eating disorder? 
I&amp;#39;m &amp;quot;evil&amp;quot;, I&amp;#39;m a &amp;quot;dirty slut&amp;quot; even though I&amp;#39;m not allowed out of the house- this must be because of how I look or something I&amp;#39;ve done- am I that person? Mom says so, so i guess so. 
&amp;nbsp;
As a young child, I was mostly raised by my grandparents nextdoor and would sleep over at their house often. I&amp;#39;d cry myself to sleep every night because I thought my mom was mad at me. Every day, I&amp;#39;d be to blame for something. Once, I even got blamed for my dad losing $100. I don&amp;#39;t even know why. My mom yelled from up at our back door to down at the yard at me, with the neighborhood kids all outside, telling me I&amp;#39;d better bring the $100 back right now. So then my friends assumed I was a thief(cause a 9 y/o who can&amp;#39;t drive and never goes anywhere has a reason for money is definitely wont get caught with random money at some point 🙄). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At some point, around 9, I started self harming because I didn&amp;#39;t understand what I had apparently done. I was upset for always being such an apparent major cause of my mother&amp;#39;s pain- the person I did love most in the world no matter what she thought.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My parents destroyed my education as an ongoing argument for the funsies I guess. I planned to graduate at 15 or 16 and GTFO. I was physically bullied at school to the point of having my arms near broken every day. I begged to be homeschooled- my plan was to be able to focus on my schooling without bullies and graduate early to get away from my family. I was in 2nd grade my first year homeschooling and skipped up to grade 5 work in everything but math, which I got up to maybe grade 3 which was equivalent to my current grade in public school work. My parents would argue about public and homeschooling and switch me back and forth at least once a school semester. So I&amp;#39;d be in public school in august for a few months, then homeschooled. Obviously this ruined my extra work I&amp;#39;d done and I became discouraged. In 7th grade, I began having a lot of trouble with math. My mom refused to help me, saying I had learning disability and just couldn&amp;#39;t learn so to not do it(and then help my lovely, psychotic step sister instead). She&amp;#39;d do this to me at public school too, and I&amp;#39;d often go in humiliated having to explain that I couldn&amp;#39;t finish my homework. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At one point, I wasn&amp;#39;t allowed outside(my grandparents had moved in) and due to that and all the stress, I embraced being reclusive. I told myself I wanted to be that way and whenever people would think it was odd, my mom would huff back at them before I could speak, saying that not everyone has to have friends.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And now I&amp;#39;m this. Looking back, I remember my dad telling me that my mom coddled me too much and kept me from other people, wanting me all to herself. At the time I thought it was ridiculous, but now I see he was right; she needed me to soothe her, to blame for everything, to be there in misery with her. 
&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I got older, decided that I wanted to try being social, so I&amp;#39;d say yes to every single opportunity. Every one. That was a terrible idea and I ended up being abused by a few predatory opportunists, which in turn caused me major anxiety, more than ever before, and I became more reclusive than ever before. I havent held a stable job in a while. Havent had friends since that time, about 10 years ago. I&amp;#39;ve been with my SO, who has been abusive off and on. Things were great for a few years until we moved out a few years ago, and now they&amp;#39;ve been very off and on. For a few years again, things have been pretty good as far as that goes, but obviously not having time and not feeling effort from the other person feels shitty too. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A couple years ago I found myself in a terrible situation with him and decided my options were prostitution, stripping, drugs, or suicide. I mass applied to jobs but when I&amp;#39;d receive a response, I was never qualified for anything but retail which I&amp;#39;ve had bad experiences with and it doesn&amp;#39;t pay enough. I stopped eating, became an alcoholic with the little funds I had, and attempted suicide somewhere near 3 times a week on average for a few months straight. I almost succeeded once and then my bf unexpectedly came home early and I was sent to the hospital. Things didn&amp;#39;t get better when I got out, I threw away my antidepressants since my feelings felt inappropriate in relation to my thoughts and situation, and resumed weekly attempts. Otherwise I&amp;#39;d just lie in bed and try not to get up for fear of killing myself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2017 and 2018 sucked. Last year got a little better and by the end of the year I decided to go back to school. I decided rather abruptly and didn&amp;#39;t have time to seek diagnosis for learning disabilities, which I think I obviously have. I have a diagnosis of anxiety disorders and recurrent major depressive disorder but I&amp;#39;ve assumed I wouldn&amp;#39;t receive any accommodations for those because.. what can be done?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Instead I&amp;#39;ve tried plowing through my feelings and intentionally making myself uncomfortable by joining clubs and going to campus in person, but I&amp;#39;m not adjusting as quickly as I&amp;#39;d hoped. And in the real world, I will have to talk, I will have to have social skills. No one cares about you in the real world. I&amp;#39;m old and have already exposed myself to that in the many job fields I&amp;#39;ve attempted, so I&amp;#39;m aware. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I just feel like I&amp;#39;m a failure. And now I&amp;#39;m overloading myself and I dont want to back down, but idk how to deal with everything and get no help, and have nothing outside of school and working at home. I need a good balance, but I have literally no way of making that happen. I&amp;#39;m in a club that meets once a week, the paper which is 1x a month, and now a new club that no one showed up for, so I became club leader. This will force me into social situations, and I hope that I can do it. In my head I&amp;#39;m telling myself to just do it, so I try, and I talk, and garbage comes out. And I&amp;#39;m older than everyone else, so it&amp;#39;s awkward. I&amp;#39;m not supposed to be so immature and stupid by social standards. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I feel like I&amp;#39;m just not going to make it. I have straight A&amp;#39;s but I feel like I don&amp;#39;t deserve them. My art never looks good to me even after spending hours working. I need to make this work but I dont know how. I dont know how to change who I&amp;#39;ve been for 29 years, in an instant, but I desperately want to. I want to be different, I dont want to be who I am anymore. In the meantime, I&amp;#39;m trying to squeeze in time with my SO and getting very little sleep. Most of it is just time in the same room not even interacting or talking or anything and I feel really void of any affection and social interaction right now, as well as anything fun. I used to walk every day- it&amp;#39;s something that lessens the frequency of nerve pain and I dont even have time for that. The weather has been shit anyway. I dont find gaming fun, I don&amp;#39;t like to sit, but that&amp;#39;s all I&amp;#39;m doing. I&amp;#39;m exhausted. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I dont even know what I&amp;#39;m getting at anymore with this. I&amp;#39;m just frustrated with life. Everything is dull,I&amp;#39;m over stressed,lonely, and I honestly just hate myself. Everything about myself is awful, I really hate who I am. I became really sick in the first few weeks of school and have had bronchitis for about 3-4 weeks. It&amp;#39;s getting better but I feel like that happening really fucked a lot up for me since I had no energy. I dont know how to manage everything or how to socialize. I feel like I should just kill myself but I dont know how to even do it properly in a way that wont be totally awful. I&amp;#39;m looking to get away from pain and if the last minutes of my life could at least be peaceful that would be, well, ideal. I really wish assisted suicide for chronically suicidal people was a thing sometimes.&lt;/p&gt;

,SuicideWatch,"So I've been scrolling down this page for a while now and I'm amazed by how much people feel the same way as I have for a while now. It doesn't make me feel any better but actually more determined to take my life knowing people live the rest of their life like this. 

I'm 16 years old I left school at 15 quit college at 16 and have no qualifications to rely on. I'm extremely socially awkward and possibly have deppresion I don't know. See the thing is I also have a extreme fear of doctors and just having people examine me in general and this has been taking more of an effect on me than normal.

Around December last year I took acid for the first time. I don't remember a lot about that night as I entered an incredibly deep bad trip after my friend was kicked out of the house leaving me alone  on my first time. As I said I can't remember a lot about that night but  2 main factors stuck with me 1. My balls felt HEAVY real heavy 2. I thought I killed myself on multiple occasions that night. I kept seeing images of a weapon infront of me each time different each time more deadly. Everyone time believing they were real I tried to use them to end my life. And it felt like I would wake up everytime alive and I would cry. 

Reading back on this probably should have mentioned before I was already suicidal as shit before taking oh well.

Anyway couple months progress I'm doing ok and I'm lying in bed smoking a joint when that sane feeling of heaviness occurred in my balls not as strong this time but still there. After a couple weeks of consistent around night time feelings of heaviness occurred I decided to Google (yeah ik) my issue.

To my absolute fucking horror I discovered I have something called a vardicole or something like that I don't want to go back and check as I'm extremely 0aranoid of reading something I don't want to.

Now before anything gets typed I want to say that it is 100 percent that condition (whatever the name may be) as the symptoms aren't exactly common among other conditions. 

As I said in extremely scared of hospitals and getting examined so something around that area has an extreme effect on me even thinking about getting it checked.

I've been doing good for a while now but I can't get the thoughts out of my head and I can feel myself spiralling until those final moments where I can find eternal peace. 

So this is what I ask of you reading this if you would help me. I'm terrified of searching what will happen to me if I don't get surgery but I also kind of want to know so I'm basing this heavily on trust if you were to do a tiny bit of research on the condition and only leave a positive comment ABSOLUTELY NOTHING NEGATIVE ABOUT CONDITION PLEASE. Like if it will damage me do not tell me even if it can kill please don't tell me. But if you find anything that will be reassuring please let me know. Because I'm not getting surgery so please please don't tell me anything bad about it I am genuinely terrified to post this in case people just say shit anyway

3.) College just makes me very depressed I feel like I can’t succeed in anything and that I’m wasting money. 
4.) The factor that people hate each other for no reason. (Politics, Race, Sexuality etc.)
Someone please help me I also take depression meds and talk to my doctor about how they don’t work and none of the counseling or therapy I’ve had helps&lt;/p&gt;

I don’t even have my meda anymore even though i doubt they would help. I am really thinking about overdosing again but idk if it would work because the other times i tried it didn’t work either. I just hate my life so much and no it doesn’t t better eventually, i’ve been telling myself that forever but whenever it gets a bit better, it gets a lot worse immediately after. I just can’t do it anymore&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Edit: this is a throwaway account so the people i know on here don’t know it’s me&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Edit 2: i just realised my life literally has no meaning anymore, i have no goals, i am unhappy, i have nothing i enjoy and i just wanna die, i am literally just staying alive for other people&lt;/p&gt;

,SuicideWatch,"I have nothing but negative thoughts all the time, I can remember when it started but it has gotten so bad I tend to cry myself to sleep if I even can sleep. I don't know who to talk to and don't really have anyone to talk to so I just want to dump everything here and maybe get some guidance before I do something to make the pain go away. I never see my parents due to my mom and step dad being too busy with work and running a business and my dad is probably somewhere rotting in Arizona. My sister is deployed in the navy and the other ran away a few years ago and haven't heard from her, and my older brother is a drug addict that cut ties with us a long time ago. 

I don't want to message a suicide hotline out of fear they will send an ambulance or force me into a hospital forcing bills on me that I can not afford, and I have no one close to talk to about it. My situation is, growing up my parents both lived in different bad areas with little money. I was never smart or talented at anything besides having an over active imagination. I always had a learning issue both with paying attention and remembering information regardless of how hard I tried. Didn't have a lot of friends and ended up dropping out of high school. About 3 years ago I went back and got my Adult Diploma with the hopes it would be enough to get me on my feet. I'm now almost 26 and just a few months ago after I saw someone about my mental health I found out I have ADD. So some things where answered there, but it didn't help much. 

The small amount of friends that I have, have become aware of my increasing depressed emotions and have tried to help but for the most part, they seem to pay no mind to it. I've working dead end jobs for most of my adult life until recently when I took a boot camp course in the Information Technology field. I then interned for 5 weeks and after got a position working for a small company as an IT help desk technician under a 3 month to perm contract. Or that's what they told me during the interview. I never did anything IT related and the contract was constantly extend by 3 months until my 9th month there. In that time, I've worked for some bad companies, but I have never worked somewhere that treated there (specifically the US employees) so poorly. They then after promising to increase my pay hired me on full time as salary, and cut my pay thinking I wouldn't notice. I then secretly started looking for new positions starting last July until November of last year when I was tired of they way they have treated me for over a year and without thinking, just left, even though I have monthly bills. 

On top of the learning problems, I also have extreme anger problems and am very VERY impatient. As far as work goes, I have applied to countless IT positions since last July, with professional help updating resumes and cover letters, and re learning (trying to) as much IT knowledge as I can after using pretty much none of it at my last job and forgetting almost all of it, but I've gotten nothing. I have had 2 companies interview me and reject me after the 2nd or 3rd interview, and all of the other countless companies I've applied to have either flat out rejected me or have not said anything. I have next to nothing left with money and if I don't find something soon, I will lose everything and I can only imagine how bad my credit will be and the law suits to follow. Other than job things, I have never been in a real relationship, I never see my family even though I literally live with my mom and step dad, I almost never see my friends, I have an extreme hate for people I'm assuming due to everything I've had to go through over the years, and every day I spend hours trying to teach myself new things and applying for any position available that could possible help me with my situation, but since the last interview rejection and the constant no reply and email rejections, I can't anymore. 

I've tried so hard to make things better for myself, seeking medical help, close support from family and friends, and will power, but it's always one step forward and then being launched back. I'm tired of starting over, I'm tired of only knowing rejection and being ignored not just from jobs but from everything. I have become so angry and hate filled that I can't see happiness in anything. I used to love movies and video games and can't find joy in those. The only piece of escape I have day to day is music, because it almost thinks for me. I'm listening to it but I feel like it's also listening to me, feeling my constant pain and emotional wreck. Everyone says it will get better, but I've been at this for so long and it only keeps getting worse. I have put the effort in but it's like some deity is purposefully trying to prevent me from being happy or making myself successful, and over the past few weeks, I can't stop thinking of killing myself. Making this awful pain go away and not feeling anything anymore. The only thing that holds me back is the thought of what comes after. Possible non existence which I can't even comprehend. Just not knowing is the only thing holding me back, but even that fear is starting to go away and taking an early exit seems more and more like the best option.

I apologize for the extremely long post, maybe just a way to leave a small mark on existence to make myself feel a little better. I don't seem myself feeling any better even if my hard work eventually gets me anywhere, a family, a job that actually pays enough for me to live on my own, not constantly worrying if I have enough for food and water or if I have to cut that out to make my payments. It's hard to feel happy or accomplished when all you know is failure and loss. There is more but I feel like I've said enough if anyone even reads this.

,SuicideWatch,"I’m having doubts about wanting to keep going. I just turned 25, I’m a girl from the US who is disabled (I have depression, BPD, anxiety, ADD and I have bad tremors as a result of these issues) and my parents treat me like I’m a little girl. I have not worked a proper job very much in my life and I’m a little immature for my age. 

Basically, where I am now, I feel mentally and physically unwell to work - the tremors go in and out and I collapse of exhaustion at least twice a month from them. My parents, my mum especially- are pressuring me to work, she gives me jobs I know I wouldn’t be able to handle and I apply to them to make her happy, though I never hear back. She is a social worker and when I say I’m too unwell to work she goes *”I’ve worked with people with Down’s syndrome, who were severely disabled, they had jobs.”* or *”I worked with a schizophrenic woman once, that’s worse than what you have, and she held down a 9 to 5 job.”* and so fourth. I think I should be on disability but my mum sees that as “giving up” and says that they won’t accept me because I “haven’t showed signs of trying” IE my small work history - the majority of money I’ve made over the years is from my music, but that comes few and far between.
Because I don’t have a job, my mum makes it my “job” in the house to be the only person who ever cleans our cats’ litter box, and when my tremors are going this is bad because I can’t hold the bag straight and I get litter and cat droppings everywhere, but she’s so insistent on sticking it to me that I’m not working that this doesn’t matter. 
I Have two girlfriends, my parents only know I’m dating one of them. One lives in Canada, I have wanted to run away there but my mum said if I even tried to visit her she would get Canadian police to come get me since I’m mentally unwell (my Canadian girlfriend also struggles with that and my parents like her but says she’s a “basket case” and that I shouldn’t  date her) but I  kinda don’t have a passport anyway.

My other girlfriend lives in the Midwest US and my mum says if I moved there I’d never contact the family ever again even though I told her I would, and that I would become ungrateful towards my girlfriend and get an “attitude” with her - my parents say I have a short temper but I’m quite mellow, it’s just that years of verbal abuse from my father - who to his credit is finally doing something about this - has gotten me very damaged.

,SuicideWatch,"I have a beautiful wife and 2 year old son. A great job. Had a good childhood. But I’ve been dealing with depression for years. I’m extremely unhappy. I find it exhausting having to interact with people. I hate basically everything about myself and even more so because on paper I have no reason to be unhappy. I’m tired. I think about killing myself a lot but feel extremely guilty about leaving my wife and child. I had a bit of a breakdown last year and told my wife I wanted to die and now she is constantly worried about me. I can see how stressful it is for her.

Most tragic thing that keeps bothering me on daily basis is that few months ago me and my exgirlfiend were still in a happy relationship. I saw myself sharing a future with her. I might have committed too much in the relationship, because it was something I always relied on. We had this weird phase of not talking much before breaking up. She constantly said she was busy with school work, family and hobbies. I believed her. She is a very work active person. One day, about few weeks ago she called me and said she thinks she is gay. I was heartbroken obviously. I still am. She has been seeing this girl a lot too. I cant stop thinking about the ''what ifs''.  What if she was secretly cheating on me? What if she never even loved me? What if she dated me out of pity for 2 whole years? I can barely sleep at night thinking about this.

Not only am I going through a rough heartbreak, I am also struggling with quite severe loneliness. It is hard for me to admit, because I enjoy being alone, but it does make sense that I am seriously lonely. Few months ago I stopped going to school and after consulting with teachers we decided that it is the best for me to do school work from home. I never leave the house to go see friends.

There really hasn't been a day that has gone by where I don't think about killing myself, negative thoughts about myself, just bursting into tears alone in my room or just in public.

The pain that I am feeling is completely unbearable, I'm just so tired of even living and moving forward in this life when I just don't think worth it. My whole life I just have been faced with pain and pain and pain again and I just keep trying and I'm just so tired. I'm tired of this life. Tired of the pain and just tired with myself.

I have come to the realization that no matter what I do, no matter how hard I try, or how hard I try to become someone else. I just will never be good enough, that has always been what my life has been about. I don't even know who I am anymore, I look in the mirror and I just don't recognize who I am anymore let alone know who I am anymore. Sounds weird, I know. It's just I was never happy with who I was as a person and that always fucked me up then I try being other people and that always fucked me up so I just never win. It's just so fucking disheartening and gruesome to just always be put back in this hellish place of just never being enough, uglyness, trying so hard and getting fucked and this whole stupid ass existence.

I just don't see a future anymore. I don't want to see tomorrow anymore. I'm constantly wishing for death. Hoping I get run over by a car, get in an accident, OD on anything. Just something that will take this pain away.

I have been feeling this way for years and years and I just never seem to get a break, not even for a single moment. I am always brought back here. This is all I never know. I don't deserve love or happiness or even a glimpse of joy. I'm always there for others and I try my best to be supportive to show my love and care but when it come's to me I just don't get it.

I'm ready to go. I say that every day and yet I'm still here.... I don't know why that is though. But at the same time I just feel like i'm one step closer to pushing the trigger and ending it all.

I just can’t take it anymore i feel so worthless, I’m turning 18 this year and i think i can no longer go on like this i’ve wanted to die since i was 11. why is life so painful every day is a constantly struggle for me and i can’t even find motivation to keep going on. I cant even picture myself as an adult, i see nothing. These are all just words i cant even put together properly without autocorrect cause i’m crying too much, i just want to feel okay. How does being loved feel like? I’ve only felt it once with someone who changed their mind and started caring about somebody else in that particular way and broke off all contact with me. I’m so tired of people giving me “tough love” and saying my decisions are selfish, i know i am, it’s just making it worst.

,SuicideWatch,"I'm 28m, I moved back in with my parents when my house was sold out from under me.  I've been slowly deteriorating.  I've considered suicide since I was in middleschool.  And attempted sometimes halfheartedly, a handful of times.

&amp;#x200B;

I feel empty.  Like I don't belong.  I have been single for the last 6 years.  Not counting short relationships.  I haven't gone to college.  I have no desire to continue living.

&amp;#x200B;

When I was younger suicide was a strong but fleeting feeling.  It would hit me like a train but if I held on for long enough it would disappear like a light being switched off.  As I grow older it seems that those feelings that before were quick, are no constant.  Suicide is almost always on my mind.  And my determination to succeed seems to have strengthened.  


I have very little to complain about in life.  I have a job, I'm saving money.  I have some fantastic friends, and I live in a beautiful part of the world.  


I am alone though.  Every attempt I've made at having a relationship with a woman has failed.  Not always because of me.  But the feeling of being empty and alone is unbearable.  Partnership is hardwired into our dna and I seem to have been born into the perfect brain for avoiding it.

&amp;#x200B;

I just don't know what to do.  I want to end it.  I'm worried what it might do to my parents.  They are already on the  edge of a divorce that I believe has been coming since I was very young.  They have already shown themselves to be fairly incapable when it comes to helping me with my mental issues.  They knew I had ADD as a child but did nothing about it.  Hoping it would go away.  They've taken me to therapy for my depression, but I find it difficult to be honest about my feelings when I'm face to face with someone.  Because the few times I have been, it has lead to a response consisting of distance, and alienation, not compassion or empathy.  And even more often the simple words ""suck it up"".

&amp;#x200B;

I'm fairly sure I'll die by suicide.  Likely within the next few years.  My only goal is to try and patch up my relationships with family and loved ones so that  I can send myself off with the least amount of guilt possible.  I don't want to tear peoples lives apart.  I just wish I had never been born.  I don't feel lovable.  I don't feel as if I can really trust anyone.

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I feel empty.  Like I don&amp;#39;t belong.  I have been single for the last 6 years.  Not counting short relationships.  I haven&amp;#39;t gone to college.  I have no desire to continue living.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I was younger suicide was a strong but fleeting feeling.  It would hit me like a train but if I held on for long enough it would disappear like a light being switched off.

Because Yes, lets put posters to the suicide hotline a bit everywhere, look, we're only helping!

The suicide hotline! yes ! of course! why didn't I think of that?

All those things are there to make other people happy and fool them into thinking ""They're doing a great job helping!""  
You're really not.

How about this one? Force them to seek counselling  
Ah yes! Because talking about how I feel is going to make my problems go away! Of course  
Well, you'll get tools to /cope/ with those things, see -  
Oh! but it won't resolve any of the underlying issues, I see, you're only treating the symptoms of flesh eating  disease.

Institutionalisation?  
Well, how about fuck you Sheryl. Because isolating me even more really is going to help.  
But YOU can rest assured that /you did everything you could/! Look! the problem is no longer visible to you!
So therefore it must be working!   
Pat yourself on the shoulder, you did a great job!   
That person surely isn't going to fold into themselves even more than they already have
as they just sit around looking at blank walls, waiting for there next therapy session with doctors that are too rushed  
or overworked to care or do any good.  
It's like facing the corner for ""adults"". Think nice and hard about what you did! See you in three weeks!  

Well, how about numbing him AND therapy?   
Listen Maribeth, why do you think that's going to work? Because there's an entire industry around it?   
That must mean it HAS to be successful! Everyone! Everytime! Guaranteed!  
Surely it can ONLY /help/ those poor depressed souls, because the good doctor and the books say that it works
Surely their one follow-up call to re-make an appointment will change everything when they failed to show up  
Well, they didn't want to be here, on to someone that actually WANTS to be helped  
And the cycle... continues  

Surely taking pills to numb me to force me to sit in emotional comatose will   
Cure me of my autoimmune disease that will end me prematurally anyways  
Find me nice stable jobs that can work around my frequent and random stays at the hospital  
Stop jobs from firing me for invalid reasons because of it  
And extinguish an innumerable amount of very real fires in my life that set me down this path in the first place

holding on with all their might despite the weight trying to sink ever deeper  
And the mightiest of tugs, going through that hill  
Holding on, as hard as they can, as they careen down the quantum waterfall in a burst of energy

,SuicideWatch,"I have been diagnosed with major depression and anxiety years ago. Hi, I'm a 41 year old male with a good job, make good money, why should I be hurting? Depression, anxiety and suicide runs in my family. I have been committed to a 72 hour hold twice for being suicidal and planning my suicide. I do self harm. I think about suicide weekly, sometimes daily. I don't want medication but I self medicate with alcohol, work obsession or high risk sports. I'm embarrassed because I can't fit in with life, I'm broken with no fix. I suffer in silence as I don't want to bother my family, friends and girlfriend. I have planned my suicide many times, even tonight. Yes, I have written many suicide notes as well.

If I tell someone, they lock me up without shoelaces. This is not what I need, this causes me to hide it even more. I'm broken with no fix. I already go through cycles of being numb, angry, and sad. I don't want to feel numb from medication (I've been there before, what is the purpose.). I don't trust anyone to talk about this with, they respond with ways that make me hide my what I truly feel.

I want this pain to stop, the pain I've been feeling for years. Why am I broken? Besides not waking up, I don't know what else is the answer. I understand why my family member committed suicide, I get it, it isn't selfish, it is to stop the pain that many can't understand.

I don't know what to do. Do I end it, hide in silence and keep everyone happy, or say something and be even more miserable and in turn become more numb? Who really cares? I know alcohol doesn't help, but it helps me sleep, or if I don't drink here I am wide awake trying to make my brain quiet. I do high risk sports, secretly hoping that I will die.

I spent last night at the emergency room alone, I didn't contact my family, friends and erased a message for my girlfriend (I wasn't sure if it was a heart attack and didn't want to die alone but didn't want to bother anyone). My girlfriend saw some erased messages, so I told my girlfriend that it was some chest pain I wanted to make sure wasn't anything, I never told my family or friends and never will.

I don't know what to do, I need this to stop. This is my cycle, I'm numb or angry at everyone and push everyone way. If I wake up tomorrow, I will think whoever wrote this is an idiot and stupid, numb and ignorant to the pain I feel. Cycle repeats.

,SuicideWatch,"Hey Reddit. I’ve been debating posting on here for a while but I’m having more suicidal thoughts than ever before and I just need to get this all of my chest. I’m 32, male. I have an amazing girlfriend who is way out of my league and a fun job I enjoy and yet, here I am. 

Despite having some really good parts of my life, I’m slammed by thoughts of being worthless and just living a pointless existence. I’m in debt up to my eyeballs and my credit is trashed. I feel like despite getting a $15,000 raise at work, I’m still nowhere near where I want to be at this point in my life. I feel like I have no tangible future and am just waiting to die one day. In the past 4 years I’ve lost my father and my grandmother, two of the most influential people in my life. I’m in the process of moving but am having a difficult time finding good apartments because of my credit so Ive been forced to stay with my mom until I’m settled. I travel for my job and my car is falling apart but I don’t have good replacement options again because of the credit issue. I’m ridden with anxiety about everything and fear of future issues prevents me from enjoying the now. To top it all off, I was visiting my girlfriend this weekend who lives a few hours away from me and I severely inured my knee and I can’t walk. I have to find a surgeon and probably have an operation and she wants to take care of me hand and foot but it just makes me feel like I’m a giant burden. She’s so amazing and I feel like I don’t offer anything financially and am just a 32 dependent who, as of right now can barely make it to the bathroom because of this damn leg. 

I am an atheist. I don’t believe in any form of an afterlife as I just can’t accept something with no evidence. I firmly believe in my heart that my grandmother and father are gone. Aside from their graves nothing remains of them and they are not in another realm enjoying themselves. All that exists for then is the black void of nothingness. And despite so many rays of sunshine in my dark life, I feel so envious of them. To not have to feel this anxiety and pain anymore is such an appealing feeling to me. This world is such a terrible place where ignorance and hate have run so rampant and people take such joy in hurting their fellow man. What future can society have with a foundation like this? I find myself thinking about ending everything on a near daily basis. I see lots of redditors posting here about how they are excited for some kind of afterlife because they can’t accept that this is the best we can do. But for me, an absence of anything would be as good as the existence of a heaven. 

I feel better having laid all this out in text but I still find myself objectively weighing the pros and cons of ending my life. So I don’t know what I was hoping for by posting this.

&lt;p&gt;I feel better having laid all this out in text but I still find myself objectively weighing the pros and cons of ending my life. So I don’t know what I was hoping for by posting this. Maybe I need someone to talk me off the ledge... who knows. But in all honestly, leaping from the ledge looks better and bettter with each passing minute...&lt;/p&gt;

,SuicideWatch,"In October, I was assaulted by my then ex-boyfriend. Even though we had broken up in August,  I had reached out to him because he was one of the few people who knew that it was the year anniversary of the first time I was assaulted. And then he raped me. 

Since then, nothing has been good for me. I’ve had to withdraw from the semester because I’ve been too depressed to go to any classes. My relationships are falling apart because I’m not acting like myself anymore and no one wants to be around me. Or maybe I just want to be alone, I don’t know. I don’t sleep at night because I don’t feel safe in my own bed after what happened. And I feel like there’s no one I can talk to about anything because they’re all sick of hearing about it. Even the people I know I can trust aren’t options. If I told my mom or dad, they’d make me move back home, and that would just make things so much worse. My closest friends would try to push me to get hospitalized, which my family can’t afford. I stopped seeing my therapist because I felt like whenever I tried to open up emotionally, she would change the subject. I don’t know what to do or who to talk to anymore. 

I’ve wanted to kill myself before, and I’ve actually had several suicide attempts. Something about this time feels different. I know what I would do, and I’m not sure if I’m more afraid that it would actually work this time, or afraid of the slight possibility I could still survive.

Even though we had broken up in August,  I had reached out to him because he was one of the few people who knew that it was the year anniversary of the first time I was assaulted. And then he raped me. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since then, nothing has been good for me. I’ve had to withdraw from the semester because I’ve been too depressed to go to any classes. My relationships are falling apart because I’m not acting like myself anymore and no one wants to be around me. Or maybe I just want to be alone, I don’t know. I don’t sleep at night because I don’t feel safe in my own bed after what happened. And I feel like there’s no one I can talk to about anything because they’re all sick of hearing about it. Even the people I know I can trust aren’t options. If I told my mom or dad, they’d make me move back home, and that would just make things so much worse. My closest friends would try to push me to get hospitalized, which my family can’t afford. I stopped seeing my therapist because I felt like whenever I tried to open up emotionally, she would change the subject. I don’t know what to do or who to talk to anymore. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve wanted to kill myself before, and I’ve actually had several suicide attempts. Something about this time feels different. I know what I would do, and I’m not sure if I’m more afraid that it would actually work this time, or afraid of the slight possibility I could still survive. I know I don’t want to die, really, and that I just want the pain to stop.

,SuicideWatch,"I mean yes never feeling happiness, always feeling tired, and all that other shit that comes with depression would've contributed to this, but I think I'm just using depression as an excuse to hide the fact that I'm a terrible person.

I've had depression since at least the age of 10. I'm 17 now and until about a year or two ago my depression was never a huge problem. I was passing school, I had friends and I had hobbies. But one day after my suicide attempt I got a random boost in motivation, and I felt happiness for the first time in years. Feeling happiness only made me realize how miserable I am all the time, which led to me figuring out that I have depression.

Ever since I became aware of this, I started doing things like, failing school, ghosting friends, and dropping out of hobbies. Whenever I smile or laugh, I hide it and try my best to make myself sad.

I feel like I'm just putting on a play for myself to hide the fact that I'm just a selfish ass, who does nothing but play videogames all day.

,SuicideWatch,"on the morning of February 16 2020 i took my cat to the emergency vet to have her checked out. she was extremely skinny and was not moving and hadnt eaten or used the bathroom in 2 days. she barely wanted to be around anyone and her muscules were so weak she couldnt even use her back legs or stand. she would just drag herself to where she wanted to go then lay down exhausted. i thought she was going to die the night before but miraculously she survived but was still extremely weak and exhausted looking.

i put her in her pet cage and drove to the emergency vet. the vet examined her and immediately became accusatory and critical of me and how my kitty got into the position that she was in, asking me every question under the sun what did i give her to eat? whats her past medical history? and maybe about 40 other questions.  even calling my cat a train wreck. she was in horrible condition and he kept telling me things such as ""well if you wouldve taken her to your regular vet and had checkups sooner, all of this couldve been prevented"" ""you should've given her her medicine. hyperthyroidism is manageable and bc you didnt do this and that your cat is in the condition that shes in""   which just made me feel so damn guilty. i wanted to take her away right then and there. he then tells me that he couldnt feel her liver and that she only had 25% of her kidneys working and that she was extremely dehydrated.

he mentioned giving her medicine and iv drips and changing her diet but because of the state she was in, he said it wouldn't do much at all at this point because her kidneys would eventually fail. so then he suggests euthanasia. and my heart dropped like a rock. i didnt want to do it. i wanted to give her the medicine i was hell bent on it. ill pay it now, i dont care what the price is ill pay it now! but he kept pushing me and my sister to sign up for a credit plan to pay for it because he simply ""didnt want to be the bank"" he even said that we could give her all of the medicine and change her diet etc and theres a possibility that it still wont work at all because of how debilitated she was. 

eventually our family made the decision to have her put to sleep on the same day as the visit. we had a previous cat who passed away due to kidney failure and we didnt want her to go through the same thing. we all snuggled her, kissed her and pet her until she breathed her final breath on the table. it was heart wrenching. we didnt want to bring her home because we all live with out 80 year old grandmother who prior to having her put to sleep, my grandmother would see her dragging her legs and see how weak and exhausted she looked and would start crying and saying how she didnt want to see the cat suffer like that anymore.  we didnt want to bring her home because we didnt want anything to happen to grandma so  we had everything done in one day and it all happened so fast. im still torn about it. i feel like i can go back in time and pull her away from the table, and bring her to present day. 

i miss you so much misty,  my little baby. it felt like we all yanked you out of this world too soon and thats what drives me crazy. the regular vet i tookher to long ago when we first found out about it told us all that she had hyperthyroidism. all 3 of us were in charge of making sure she got her medicine until she finished it, and then it dwindled down to just me having the responsibility. i was in a very stressed out mindset between my shit job with no set hours,  and  taking care of my grandmother who has dementia.we have to make sure she dosent wander outside or anything. and had completely forgotten/ was counting on other family members to give her her medicine because i was not home. i had forgotten that she even took  medicine at all because she was doing so well. she was eating, and playing until about last year when i went to have her ears checked. thats when they reminded me. and it all went downhill. 

so again i gave her her medicine and she  finished it. only to find out this year she would have to be put to sleep. i never intended to hurt you misty, i never wanted you to get so sick. every morning i cry my eyes out wishing you were here with me on my bed or licking my hand or even meowing that cute little ""hello"" meow you used to do. every day i think about the what ifs and the if onlys. i cant even smell or look at certain things anymore, i cant smile or be happy anymore without my baby. 
i bought a box cutter last week because i was seriously contemplating ending my own life because of the horrible guilt. i feel like i murdered that cat. i feel like i purposefully let her get sick and die . i felt like she didnt need to be euthanized. it was my responsibility to make sure you got your medicine and i fucked up so bad. i dont want to live anymore feeling like this. im so sorry my sweet baby kitty.   how can i help my grandmother if i failed to help you? i feel like im the only one in the world dealing with this situation. i  know im not, but i just want to fucking die. i hate existing. everyday i wake up im reminded that my cat is gone. my best friend, my baby is dead and i caused it and i want to throw up. i hate living i want to die and just not feel anything im so sorry misty im so sorry",t2_5u72eglh,False,,0,False,2-16-2020,[],r/SuicideWatch,False,0,,0,False,t3_fd25b3,False,dark,,public,7,0,{},2a7b5518-8e45-11e5-a506-0ed10b342609,False,[],,False,False,,{},,False,7,,False,,1583283438.0,modmsg,[],{},,True,,1583300866.0,text,0,,,text,self.SuicideWatch,False,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;on the morning of February 16 2020 i took my cat to the emergency vet to have her checked out. she was extremely skinny and was not moving and hadnt eaten or used the bathroom in 2 days. she barely wanted to be around anyone and her muscules were so weak she couldnt even use her back legs or stand. she would just drag herself to where she wanted to go then lay down exhausted. i thought she was going to die the night before but miraculously she survived but was still extremely weak and exhausted looking.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;so again i gave her her medicine and she  finished it. only to find out this year she would have to be put to sleep. i never intended to hurt you misty, i never wanted you to get so sick. every morning i cry my eyes out wishing you were here with me on my bed or licking my hand or even meowing that cute little &amp;quot;hello&amp;quot; meow you used to do. every day i think about the what ifs and the if onlys. i cant even smell or look at certain things anymore, i cant smile or be happy anymore without my baby. 
i bought a box cutter last week because i was seriously contemplating ending my own life because of the horrible guilt. i feel like i murdered that cat. i feel like i purposefully let her get sick and die . i felt like she didnt need to be euthanized. it was my responsibility to make sure you got your medicine and i fucked up so bad. i dont want to live anymore feeling like this. im so sorry my sweet baby kitty.   how can i help my grandmother if i failed to help you? i feel like im the only one in the world dealing with this situation. i  know im not, but i just want to fucking die. i hate existing. everyday i wake up im reminded that my cat is gone. my best friend, my baby is dead and i caused it and i want to throw up. i hate living i want to die and just not feel anything im so sorry misty im so sorry&lt;/p&gt;

Obviously this is not the kind of attitude that anyone would want to put up with so I should leave to avoid pissing anyone else off even though I am absolutely right. I like to tell myself that having a better attitude means accepting a wrong position for the sake of getting along with everyone else walking off the cliff.

What a stupid, stupid fate. Well there is a third option, I could kill myself.

You're not going to make me feel any better by reminding me my country, my tax dollars contribute significantly to their peril by bombing many of those people into ruins for the sake of politicians and bureaucrats who have literally become Twitter trolls. It's not funny, I mean it. 

I want to kill myself. I have had it in my mind for a long time but there was something spiritually holding me here. I wonder if that has passed. I don't see anymore goal posts.

For the first time EVER I am going to speak to someone tomorrow about my suicidal ideation, which has plagued me for 10 years. 

I'm currently at uni, and booked an appointment with a student support officer from my school. She's not a counsellor, but can deal with academic issues (which I'm having because of the big sad), and refer students onto mental health services.

I'm absolutely shit scared. I've never really spoken to anyone about how I feel, only a couple of times drunkenly to a few friends (who've never brought it up again). I just feel like it's time because things have gotten worse recently, and I'll be graduating this summer which is terrifying. 

I'm not really sure where to start with the meeting, or about what I should say? I've never met her before, I just emailed to book a meeting.

Let me know if this is the wrong sub. I'm basically just wanting to know how to start the conversation and how much detail to go into.

I can't blame her really.

My father's gf, whom he was with at the time of his passing and for the previous 15 years or so, has already moved on and started dating a guy that I don't think dad would approve of, either.

I feel incredibly alone now, he was my go-to person whenever I had a problem. I left my job to take some time off after he passed. I&amp;#39;ve left two more jobs since then, I just can&amp;#39;t handle any of it any more. My gf, who I&amp;#39;ve been staying with, wants me to leave so she can &amp;quot;find herself.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I can&amp;#39;t blame her really.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My father&amp;#39;s gf, whom he was with at the time of his passing and for the previous 15 years or so, has already moved on and started dating a guy that I don&amp;#39;t think dad would approve of, either.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#39;t know who to turn to or what to do. I have a little bit of money saved up so I&amp;#39;m not in immediate danger, and I think I&amp;#39;ve worked it out with my gf to stay here until I find a job? I just don&amp;#39;t hold out a ton of hope. Whenever I think of getting another job, most likely in a field I hate anyway (recruiting), I just think &amp;quot;what&amp;#39;s the point?&amp;quot; Like I really don&amp;#39;t have a ton to live for at this juncture. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#39;t want it to be this way and I just can&amp;#39;t seem to figure a way out of it that would give me a good quality of life. It all just feels pointless.&lt;/p&gt;

,SuicideWatch,"My first post ever on reddit. Im feeling so low right now, been crying all night, and I just want to get better, but nothing seems to work. During Christmas vacation, I realised my partner had been cheating on me, the night I founded out, he went to that girl house and had intercourse with her. He still came back to my place after and told me everything the next day. I completely lost it, It was the first time someone cheated on me. I felt betrayed, and couldnt wrap my head around it. My reaction was to drink as much alcool, smoke cigarette until I could forget what happen.. unfortunately that wasnt enough I was still feeling so much pain. I than decides to take a half empty bottle of xanax with a bottle of antidepressant. Just to wash the pain away, just like that I was doing my first suicide attempt.  20 minutes after I realised what I had done and called emergency, an ambulance came over and I spent 24 hours at psychiatry aisle. I started seeing a psychiatrist after that, and was diagnosed for borderline personality.

&lt;p&gt;That being said, I’m not going to avoid saying something to my therapist because I think he’ll send me to a psych ward. The best chance I have to get better through meds and therapy is to be honest with what’s going on, and I’m completely fine with that. I don’t really have anything going on in my life I wouldn’t mind sacrificing a week for. Hell, I’m well prepared to sacrifice my own life in order to stop the pain. I’ve been to a psych ward before, and it’s kind of nice since it’s a way to kind of die a temporary death and be away from everything else in my life. It’s not as good as death though, since I’ll still be fucked up in the head and as long as I’m fucked up I’ll suffer, but it’s better than suffering and still having to do shit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anywho, if the psychiatry route doesn’t work I can always kill myself, but it seems stupid not to take advantage of psychiatry to the fullest while I can, and that means telling my therapist enough where I could be hospitalized.&lt;/p&gt;

,SuicideWatch,"M/16, currently going through depression and can't talk to anyone. I've been visiting a psychotherapist for about 2 years and a psychiatrist for several weeks but just decided to stop going there like 6 months ago. I've been diagnosed with social anxiety and have depression but never actually talked about that with anyone, not even with my parents or the therapists. My everyday life goes like this: wake up, survive 7 hours at school, come home, play video games for rest of the day since I don't have anything better to do, cry into sleep, repeat. In school I barely speak to anyone even though I am going in the same class for over 5 years now. Only have 1-2 friends but they mostly only see me as the last choice everytime and only want to meet up when no one else has time. Recently we got someone new in the class and it seems like he had more social contact with the everyone else in the past 3 days than me in the last 5 years. Everyone think's i am introverted and it's kinda true, but only because I get rejected by everyone I even try to talk to and get excluded from everything. When people throw parties, I never get invited but people they barely talk to get invited. My grades are horrible and I am about to get off the school and don't even know what I want to become, since i just stopped caring after I noticed that everyone ignores me and no matter how hard I try to build up a new friendship / contact, I get rejected. I am the kind of person to look at my phone and than ask someone what time it is just so I have somewhat of a social interaction lmao. My parents only see my grades but don't care about my feelings. Because of this happening over many years (basically my whole life) I began to hide behind a emotionless mask. I am not able to express my feelings. nothing. The only thing i can do is laugh (because of something funny, not because i am actually happy) or hate on something. Even if anyone would make me happy, e.g. inviting me to a party, I couldn't show it and still act bored / emotionless because I am too afraid what people would think when I suddenly change and behave like everyone else. I also don't know anymore how to feel empathy. Like i would really like to and empathize with someone but no matter how hard I try it just doesn't work. When someone is sad I can say to myself ""this person is sad"" and feel bad about it, but I cannot comprehend it. I also feel absolutely worthless. For example I don't even say hi/goodbye to most people since i think i am not worth their time. When I meet someone from school outside accidentally, I walk pass them and they walk past me just because I don't want the other person to feel awkward. I know they don't like me and their day is probably ruined just by seeing me so i don't try to force the contact. At this point in my life i noticed that people are just assholes not caring about anyone. Everyone has their perfect life and ignores me so trying further wouldn't change anything. I honestly don't know what to do anymore. In the past i began to think more often about how it would be if just killed myself. I am not really thinking about doing it, but honestly I couldn't care less if I just got hit by a but. I feel like visiting the psychiatrist / therapist wouldn't change anything since I am not being honest to them anyways and don't know how I could be. Anyone good experiences with psychiatrist?

,SuicideWatch,"I've been realizing some damn hard truths about myself. I've never been happy, ever since I was a little kid I felt like I was ""bad"". You know how children play ""house"" and it can be used in therapy to evaluate their outlook and issues? When I was a kid, I would play ""house"" with my fingers: there was the mom, dad, brother, and sister (me, the pinky finger). Each time, everyone would gang up on and beat up the sister. I just remembered that I used to ""play"" that game the other day - I don't think I have any real excuse for that, I was anxious as hell from a young age and irritable as fuck, but what kind of kid thinks of that shit? I was messed up back then.


I've talked to professionals. They seem to think that this is more than anxiety and depression. They say that I've faced a lot of trauma in my life. I suppose it makes sense. My parents were heavily abused during their childhoods, my mom even tried to kill herself as a young kid. My dad was an abusive alcoholic for most of my childhood. He and my mom would fight a lot - they would swear at each other, he would hit and throw things at her, she would scream at him and they would usually tell each other to go to Hell or drop dead. My dad was verbally abusive, and I remember he would hit my brother too. I presume he hit me, but I don't remember. All I remember is that when I was a teenager, he got so angry at me that he held me down on the couch. I was so detached, all I thought was how he was so angry he was about to drool on me, and how it was gross. I love my parents, despite their flaws. I just don't like them. We fight all the time. When I was younger, I remember that often when I got into a row with one parent, the other would get involved and then they would fight with each other. They would say horrible things like what I said above. They would say awful things to me too, like how once I was mad and my mom said I should look in the mirror to see how ugly I look. She would tell me to ""get out of her sight"" a lot. I get called a bitch at times. I'm told I treat them horrible, and I hate myself even more when they say that. Ugh. On the note of trauma, I realized earlier this year that I was repeatedly raped (oral, not vaginal) by my ex over the course of a year or so. That's also been tough to process.

It's fucked because I know my parents love me. They read to me as a child, they taught me to be independent. They just want me to be happy. But there's just always been something missing, I guess.

I realized that I may be in a chronic state of mild dissociation. I often feel detached from my body, my emotions, my environment, other people. I feel like I'm in a fog. My limbs aren't quite attached to my body, I feel floaty or dizzy. Weak and shaky. At times I dissociate harder, and I go totally numb. Can't move. Can't talk. Things look smaller, I float above or behind my body. My vision gets weird. It's scary yet comfortable because I'm aware that I'm further detached from myself and in a limbo for an hour. It fades and I get a headache, my body hurts, and I'm exhausted. Then it's back to reality, and I feel even more off for the rest of the day. I've noticed I also mildly dissociate when I try to sleep. My head is disconnected from my body, my limbs feel large or disconnect from my body. It's incredibly disturbing and I don't know why it happens. I never even realized I apparently dissociate until I started thinking about my childhood. Experienced some crazy depersonalization and derealization. When it happened, I realized that it was *very* familiar and I remembered doing it a lot as a kid. That realization fucked me up.


What really makes me feel crazy is the apparent somatic symptoms. I developed chronic visual snow and headaches as a teenager. I also started getting ocular migraines. Numerous tests and exams showed that all is well - it's just stress. My mouth has been hurting for the past year, as well. I even got an extra wisdom tooth removed, thinking that was the source of the pain. Nope. The pain persists, and is very noticeable when I'm stressed. Xrays and exams show that things are fine. I feel like a damn hypochondriac or like I'm malingering...but this is all very real to me.


I feel weak a lot. I am also dizzy, or like my brain is rotting, or stuffed with cotton/fog. My head is never ""clear"". I can't focus on much. Working is difficult. I can't truly interact with friends or family anymore. My weight has been all over. Due to horrible anxiety, I had lost a third of my body weight in 9 months. When I fell into this double depression, I lost 14 pounds in 2 weeks. Then someone I care about confronted me about the seriousness of it all. I tried to maintain my weight, and it worked for a month. Then I had a little breakdown and lost 7 pounds in 5 days. Started an antidepressant and became apathetic as hell - had an aborted suicide attempt and binge ate like crazy even though I wasn't hungry. I was like ""fuck it I deserve to gain weight and look disgusting"". I've gained 10 pounds in a week. I hate myself so much.


The more I realize, the more I hate myself. I've tried six or seven antidepressants, I've tried therapy a few times and am trying again. On another med right now. It all feels so damn hopeless. I've wanted to die since I was 13, and every day is just full of more pain and despair. 


People tell me not to give up on myself, but it gets more and more tempting as time goes on. Ever since I was 15, I always had a strong feeling I would die by suicide. I figured I wouldn't kill myself until I was 27 or 28, but things are becoming more disasterous. I just wish I had the courage to end this suffering soon.

,SuicideWatch,"Hi there, I don’t know if this will help you at all, but if it helps even one person, that’s enough for me. A bit of back ground information, I am a 22 year old that has been suffering from severe depression for the past year, with suicidal thoughts everyday of every hour. I felt like I was already dead cause no one seemed to notice me and I was slowly wasting away from the inside out. I also began to hear voices that would constantly berate me and tell me to kill myself, and after this, I sought help from my GP and was put onto anti-depressants (Sertraline) which did absolutely nothing. They didn’t make it worse, but they certainly didn’t make it better.

I was then put onto another anti-depressant (Mirtazapine) which I started taking at the beginning of February 2020, which seemed to help. I had the energy to finally get out of bed, take a shower and leave the house. But a couple of weeks ago, I noticed that although I had the energy to get up and go about my daily life, I was still thinking about killing myself everyday, but this time it was different as I had the energy and motivation to actually come up with a detailed plan and go through with it; and this scared me so much as I have never felt an urge to kill myself as much as I have in the last couple of weeks. 

So yesterday, I had a lot to deal with. My partner has been very sick with an unknown illness for nearly a year, so his parents rushed him to hospital. I was an absolute mess as I have been really struggling to 
silence the suicidal thoughts, whilst also fulfilling my duty as a carer for my partner. I had a mental breakdown after they took him to the hospital as the voices wouldn’t stop. I actually began shouting back at them, but after a few minutes sobbing on the bathroom floor, I became completely numb and decided to follow through with my plan. 

I grabbed my supplies, which involved a dog lead, but I had made sure to buy this one especially for this occasion as it perfectly fit around my neck and had a sturdy metal clip which I could attach to the banister which would hold my weight. I was ready to do it, I was ready to go, and I put the collar around my neck and began to push my neck down into the collar to cut off the blood supply to the main artery in my neck, I heard this would only take a minute or so to make me unconscious, and the whole time I was holding my dog close to my chest cause I was so scared, but I wanted to die so badly. As I could feel myself going, I stopped. And I don’t know what stopped me, but part of me thought that it wasn’t my time to go. So I ended up picking up the phone and calling someone, who managed to calm me down and helped me look at everything from a different perspective. 

I know a lot of people will say that it’s selfish for feeling suicidal or committing suicide due to the hurt it would cause to family/friends etc but from what I felt yesterday, none of that mattered. I truly believed that I wanted to die, and if I hadn’t have stopped myself when I had, I would probably be dead now. 

But this morning, my partner finally got an official diagnosis of what has been making him so ill. I am currently sat in the hospital waiting for him to come out of surgery, and I have been told by the doctors that he is going to live a very healthy, normal life after this operation. If I had have killed myself yesterday afternoon, I would never have gotten to find out that my partner was going to be okay. I would never get to marry him in April. I would never get to see him healthy and happy again. All of these things I would have never known if I was dead now. I can now look forward to being able to spend time with my partner who can now start to enjoy his life again, and I can try and enjoy mine as much as I can knowing that he will be around for a long time. 

What I’m trying to get at after my long ass story, is that if there is any sort of hope you can cling onto, whether thats a friend, a pet, something you’ve got planned in the near future, or even just the feeling of the sun on your skin. Anything to get you through each day. You never have know when your life could take a turn for the best, or if something amazing will happen; and all of these things you will never get to experience if you end it all now.

A bit of back ground information, I am a 22 year old that has been suffering from severe depression for the past year, with suicidal thoughts everyday of every hour. I felt like I was already dead cause no one seemed to notice me and I was slowly wasting away from the inside out. I also began to hear voices that would constantly berate me and tell me to kill myself, and after this, I sought help from my GP and was put onto anti-depressants (Sertraline) which did absolutely nothing. They didn’t make it worse, but they certainly didn’t make it better.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was then put onto another anti-depressant (Mirtazapine) which I started taking at the beginning of February 2020, which seemed to help. I had the energy to finally get out of bed, take a shower and leave the house. But a couple of weeks ago, I noticed that although I had the energy to get up and go about my daily life, I was still thinking about killing myself everyday, but this time it was different as I had the energy and motivation to actually come up with a detailed plan and go through with it; and this scared me so much as I have never felt an urge to kill myself as much as I have in the last couple of weeks. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So yesterday, I had a lot to deal with. My partner has been very sick with an unknown illness for nearly a year, so his parents rushed him to hospital. I was an absolute mess as I have been really struggling to 
silence the suicidal thoughts, whilst also fulfilling my duty as a carer for my partner. I had a mental breakdown after they took him to the hospital as the voices wouldn’t stop. I actually began shouting back at them, but after a few minutes sobbing on the bathroom floor, I became completely numb and decided to follow through with my plan. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I grabbed my supplies, which involved a dog lead, but I had made sure to buy this one especially for this occasion as it perfectly fit around my neck and had a sturdy metal clip which I could attach to the banister which would hold my weight. I was ready to do it, I was ready to go, and I put the collar around my neck and began to push my neck down into the collar to cut off the blood supply to the main artery in my neck, I heard this would only take a minute or so to make me unconscious, and the whole time I was holding my dog close to my chest cause I was so scared, but I wanted to die so badly. As I could feel myself going, I stopped. And I don’t know what stopped me, but part of me thought that it wasn’t my time to go. So I ended up picking up the phone and calling someone, who managed to calm me down and helped me look at everything from a different perspective. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I know a lot of people will say that it’s selfish for feeling suicidal or committing suicide due to the hurt it would cause to family/friends etc but from what I felt yesterday, none of that mattered. I truly believed that I wanted to die, and if I hadn’t have stopped myself when I had, I would probably be dead now. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But this morning, my partner finally got an official diagnosis of what has been making him so ill. I am currently sat in the hospital waiting for him to come out of surgery, and I have been told by the doctors that he is going to live a very healthy, normal life after this operation. If I had have killed myself yesterday afternoon, I would never have gotten to find out that my partner was going to be okay. I would never get to marry him in April. I would never get to see him healthy and happy again. All of these things I would have never known if I was dead now. I can now look forward to being able to spend time with my partner who can now start to enjoy his life again, and I can try and enjoy mine as much as I can knowing that he will be around for a long time. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What I’m trying to get at after my long ass story, is that if there is any sort of hope you can cling onto, whether thats a friend, a pet, something you’ve got planned in the near future, or even just the feeling of the sun on your skin. Anything to get you through each day. You never have know when your life could take a turn for the best, or if something amazing will happen; and all of these things you will never get to experience if you end it all now. I’m not here to say that you shouldn’t do it, because at the end of the day, I’m just some stranger on the internet that you don’t know. But what I do know is that things can always get better. Always. But you never know when; and you’ll never know if you’re not here.&lt;/p&gt;

I've been depressed for so fucking long it hurts to think about. At 13, 16, 19 everyone says it'll get better. I'm 23 and nothing's gotten any better.

I had a 3 year relationship and she threw me to the curb. I had a 2 year relationship following (after a break from  the 1st, we only dated a year but were close/fuck buddies for a year leading to it) and we broke up tonight, fun fact we still live together until july. My depression doesn't stem from relationships, there's a plethora of things contributing to it. I think I'm out of my depth on this one. We were fuck buddies because I didn't want another relationship. I didn't want to give someone a chance to hurt me again. 

She was moving for school and I couldn't bare the thought of losing her so I asked her to date and we planned and did move in together.
I've punched myself in the face because it's less damaging then cutting myself. I think at this point if I self harm it'll be the end. I promised myself that long ago though I didn't follow through the last time I started cutting myself. This time I think I would, one  pump of adrenaline is all it would take then I wouldn't be hurt anymore. 

I left all my friends for her, I moved an hour away for her. I dont see a point in living, I dont see a point in eating or sleeping. 

I dont know what I'm expecting fro. This honestly, I have noone but my sister and I hate being a burden on her (though tonight she may have kept me here). I know how I'd do it, it would be a 10 minute trip to get what I need. I dont want to but I have nothing and noone. No friends, out.of my family only my nana and sister talk to me. I've texted my dad yesterday and today about a car issue and that's the most we've talked in 2 days than I can remember. Usually it's around 1 a month, sometimes more sometimes less.

I'm a burden on everyone. I think the world would be a better place. All I can think about is putting a knife against my throat and givin' er. 

Relationships didn't cause this, certainly attributed. No friends, no family, noone to hurt if I die. I dont know what I was hoping to accomplish with this post but I think its pushed me farther towards doing it.

When I was a kid, I was pretty much normal and had my group of friends but I used to be very shy and faced a lot of verbal abuse at that time but kept quite and thought it was a normal and ok thing, it didn't affect me though very much because of that. However in middle school, I've experienced trauma that changed me forever and left a very deep scar on me emotionally that took me years to overcome because no one tried to help, those who see me went through it and those who I spoke to about it didn't try to help. For years I had trust issues and was paranoid most of the time, it was my first experience of feeling alone and that no one understands me, and slowly I started to drift away and shut myself out, I just wanted to be alone and because of that I started to lose friends but I didn't care at that time, I thought I was doing the right thing by avoiding as much social interaction as possible. I guess in a way I was trying to protect myself.

The years after that, I've tried to regain my social life back and make friends again, I tried everything that I can from trying to act as a happy and funny person cause no one wants to see the real me, my depressing and sad self who wants to make friends with such a person? and when it actually works out, I thought I was doing the right thing but it ends up making me more depressed cause it takes me a lot of effort to be ""that person"" and I really didn't felt like I'm making any deep connection with anyone so I was like screw it, I'll just be myself by which I mean that I will not try anything to be forcefully liked by others and I thought since I'm into so many things, I will probably find someone who is into one of these things and be friends with but that didn't work out either. I kinda became that extra friend in a group that her existence or not didn't make any difference or that friend who you come to when your other friends are not around or that person you hang out not because you enjoy their company but you just don't want to be sitting alone. That messed me up in my senior year of high school, I felt like shit and I spent most of the time during the break in the toilet cause I rather that than feeling like shit when I am with others. And just to be clear, they are not awful people and they didn't say anything bad to me, it's just I've been friends with them for so long and whether at that time when I was trying to be the funny and happy person or myself, either way, I never felt I belong or that anyone cared, I felt I was just someone they knew and sure why not they can call a ""friend"".

In college though is where my struggle peaked, all those friendships that I made in high school are slowly disappearing everyone was moving on with their lives and I guess that means leaving unwanted relationships behind but regardless I did what I thought was right and did my part. I've reached out to them but it always ends up a one-sided relationship with everyone apparently and no one will reach out to me if I don't so I stopped. There was this one person I was close to during my school years and I tried to be the friend she can rely on in time of needs and depend on, I wanted to be always there for her but she never makes time for me but somehow she can with others so I tried to put ""our friendship"" to the test and just respond coldly to her messages just to see if she will ask what's wrong, I want her to notice that there was a problem and see if she gonna care about our friendship but she ends up unfollowing me in social media and blocked me out of her life that simply even though she perfectly knows me too well and knows that this is not my kind of behavior.

I had no problem talking with strangers, I can open a conversation and interact with anyone easily so trying to get to know people in college was not difficult except I don't think anyone wanted to be my friend, I just remain their classmate. I end up making just one friend in college, we had a lot in common and I really believed it could work out but it took a lot of ignoring of her frustrating attitude which sometimes makes me wonder if she will bother to hold on to me if I ever show my frustration. At some point, I've gone through a deep depression that made me very suicidal and thought there was no future for me but I was trying to hold on to hope and as much I want to act tough and act like I can handle this I couldn't, I really just need someone to talk to and so far as you can see I had no one except this college friend and I didn't know how it will go but thought let's give it a try so I opened up to her and after when I was done, the conversation didn't last for 2 minutes and I was so crushed because sure maybe she was not the perfect person to open up to but at that time I didn't have any option and I just really needed someone in my life to talk to. I really thought I'm gonna do it on that day cause I really lost hope.

As of now, it feels like I'm back at the starting point. I probably sound very awfully pathetic person or stupid to you. Every time when I'm not able to maintain any relationship in my life, I asked myself what's wrong with me? what have I done wrong in my life? I realized after a while that I try to fix things so hard in my life that I end up breaking it or damaging it but I always thought I was doing the right thing and doing my part by reaching out or helping out but somehow it doesn't make things better. It always seems that I'm the one making the effort and if you didn't notice, throughout those stages of my life that I mentioned no one tried to be my friend or wanted to but I've always seemed to be the one who wants to be someone's friend. Right now, I'm very much confused about what exactly I'm supposed to do. I just don't understand why I'm struggling so much to find somewhere I belong, I feel very much rejected no matter what I do. If I make an effort or not I end up alone either way. Everyone in my life seems to give up on me and no one bothers to hold on to me. I just don't know if I'm supposed to give up and just accept the fact that maybe this is how things supposed to be in my life.

I tried not to bore you guys with the details and complicate stuff, I hope my situation was made clear and it wasn't confusing. I just really need some advice cause I don't think I'm going to find a good one from my mind.

,SuicideWatch,"Hi, I'm 15 years old. Currently been pulled out of school,due to many reasons, which is why I'm here so that I can clear my mind of any other thoughts that may lead me to things that I might regret later on. I'd like to share first my story so that no one would come at me.(ex. You're just 15, its just a phase. Pls stop doing this to get attention.etc) when I was very young I didn't really paid any attention whenever my father and mother would fought or when my sister( the 2nd oldest) would always ignore or would get pissed at me, because I thought that it was the norm. But things got worse when the whole family fought because of the sh*tty things my father had done and it all started because of me drinking a godd*mn cola, it went like this: ""who drank the cola?"" My father asked I was very scared so I didn't replied he asked that again and again until my mother told my father off, until they just started to shout at each other which forced my eldest sister to butt in, and the whole thing went to what my father did, such as adultery and abuse. So it lead to my father pushing my mother, which pushed my sisters to fight my father, physically. I couldn't do anything but it really shocked me, and blamed myself for it. After the whole ordeal, it took 5 months to mend back the family. I thought finally, but I still had other problemsto face. I know that its stereotypical of me to say this but my asian parents(filipino) would always forced me to study when I never wanted any of this, I just wanted to play with other kids with no care in the world but I couldn't. My mothers way of teaching really left a toll on me cuz she would just hit me whenever I get the wrong answer or if I couldn't reply with the correct answer. I've always been the 2nd honor roll, but when she said this to me on the way back home ""pls don't drop your grades it would be really embarassing to my friends if you did"" that was jusy painful for me. others may think that I'm overreacting it was still really painful, tho I still couldn't speak my mind, I continued still, I was getting bullied as well for no reason. Years went by I was already in my first year of highschool in a prestige academy. I made friends, been respected, and I had little bumps in my grades but I still felt really great. Then one day one of my friends who is a guy told me to hang out with him, I couldn't tell that he had malicious intents. I was just really stupid. He cornered me ""can i touch your boobs?"" He said, I was shocked and refused but he was really strong and managed to touched me and resorted to attempted rape, afte I broke free, crying and running in the same day. I couldn't tell anyone nor my parent. So I just cried the whole night and proceeded to go to school and bearing to be with him in the same class. I had finally mustered up the courage to tell the guidance councelor, and due to that he got expelled and words got out because of the things he did and so I got harassed even more with the guys but I couldn't do anything and told myself to bear with it. I now entered my 2nd year of highschool which started the changes with me I became more irritated, a hot mess. I've been disrespectful to my mom, the reason we fight every morning. And another problem rosed up. A mistress of my father contacted me, I knew that she was just messing with me but I felt so angry. So I told my guidance counselor because I didn't know what to do anymore, so she told my mom and filed a case to my dads mistress, but the case got dropped because they said the account iwas fake when clearly it wasn't, I know I'm no professional but it was pretty obvious that it wasn't fake. I got even more mad because my mom didn't mind and told me it must be  Gods plan (I'm christian but I'm not really on how my mother believes)now things really went downhill for me.I couldn't eat, I couldn't think of happy thoughts, I  would just think of nothing, or everything is just useless even humanity, and that I wished I could just sleep and die from it. Things got even worse because my sister(the 2nd eldest), whenever I tell her shes wrong she would get mad at me,whenever I got mad at her she would get made at me, even tho she was in the wrong, but she was too prideful and wouldn't say sorry but I still did anyway. When things got even more hectic I started to hurt myself, my mom knew and told me angrily that I did it because of the internet. I couldn't take it anymore everything that I do is wrong,  its like I'm the misfortune. I wanted to kill myself, which is why I went to the guidance counselor, and told my mom everything, so she pulled me out of school, and appointed me to a psychiatrist but the medicines was too much for me, in short it was painful, and it makes me go insane for some reason, and even messed with my diet(made me eat more). So my mom stopped me from drinking the pills, but the withdrawal was sh*tty too. I still get mad at everything and I really want to kill myself.

i’m not the best worker. i’m incredibly lazy. not because i choose to have fun, but because i don’t feel good enough. my motivation to do anything is at a 0. another factor of why is i never know what i want to do. my upbringing wasn’t great and i was always constantly thrown off course from the things i really wanted to do to cater to people who didn’t care to see me happy. now i’m kinda doing my own shit without being asked, but it took me almost a year to learn how to think for myself. all thanks to my current partner though.

i’m starting to lose hope though. although i do have people i care for, i’m afraid of telling them how i feel beyond just “i’m depressed.” i know it makes the people around me really sad and sometimes suicidal themselves. so i stay quiet of the actual extent of how bad it can be. and because of my job, its hard to make friends. i can’t even tell people about what i do. do you know how lonely it gets? having to bottle everything up but too afraid to tell people how its just eating me up slowly. i was doing well for a second with my job and then last week, i spent the whole time all burnt out, crying nonstop just by myself. i but because of my condition and how it’s affecting me, i’m losing the one person who was able to get me to be productive and ignore my feelings. people are gonna comment and say “don’t ignore your feelings,” but i’m tired of having it impede my progress. and i know if they leave, i’ll go back to how i was; not doing anything and just laying all curled up in a ball just waiting for death to come naturally.

when I don't feel sad I become very thankful and when I try to express to God thanks for what he has given me, I feel guilty for spending my time self harming or being self destructive. I feel I'll never be able to truly convey how thankful I am for what he's given me and I'm back to square one, just wishing I was never born so I wouldn't have these thoughts and emotions.

I want him and need him here. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m already suicidal myself outside of this situation. I&amp;#39;m being selfish, but I don&amp;#39;t know how I&amp;#39;ll survive this. I can&amp;#39;t see a future without him, and I know there will be a hole in my heart for the rest of my life that I&amp;#39;m not ready for.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He&amp;#39;s in a bad situation and I can&amp;#39;t fix any of it. He&amp;#39;s says he&amp;#39;s ready to go. I know my feelings just put more stress on him, so I try to avoid talking about them as much as I&amp;#39;d like to. We&amp;#39;re long distance so I can&amp;#39;t even touch him. He&amp;#39;s been pushing me away for awhile now and it hurts so much. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m also struggling morally with allowing him to go through with it. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I won&amp;#39;t have anyone to lean on because you can&amp;#39;t talk to people about allowing someone to suicide. I think my one friend who knows about the situation will think I&amp;#39;m a bad person for not getting the authorities involved. &lt;/p&gt;

I returned to the UK after living abroad 5 months ago and things seemed promising at first however things went downhill pretty quickly. Finding a job has been a nightmare - i have decent experience and have had a lot of interviews but everywhere either ghosts me or rejects me. I get rejected a lot because I ""dont show I want the job enough"" but years of BPD and depression mean I find it incredibly hard to show my emotions. One company rejected me for this reason after 4 rounds of interviews!

On top of that, I was with a gambling addict a few years ago who made my life hell and created all kinds of debt for me (signing up to websites with my details, getting loans out in my name). Completely my fault for sticking with him so long but he has left me with £12,000 approx worth of debt so of course I am being chased on those debts too. I am also not entitled to any benefits. 

So finally I have ran out of money and am 2 months behind on rent, I let my rental company know today and was pretty honest about my circumstances (I said it was because of redundancy as it's less embarrassing). We agreed I will move out this week, not that I was expecting any sympathy but the lady at the rental company was a dick.

2 days ago, i was out on my porch, writing a suicide note. seemingly, getting the last rays of sunshine i would ever feel. I was content with that. Then, I heard my phone ringing. Who the hell is calling me on my last day here. 

My best friends twin sister had been diagnosed with Leukemia. Think about your BEST friend, and how their pain, is often yours, as well. I mean, why wasn't I already on my way to grab my car keys and see him and his family? 

After a few grief-stricken hours spent with them, I headed back home. Then, I realized; for a whole two hours, did I really just forget about fucking killing myself?

The one thing that took me out of my thoughts of death were simply thoughts about someone else. And it helped me realize why I ended things with heroine, and not with my life. 

I'm not one to know whether it is healthy or not to love someone more than you love yourself. All I know, is that a phone call from my best friend stopped me from killing myself. The circumstances of why he called me reminded me of the importance of me still being alive. Anyone who has experienced something like this, I encourage you to not see these instances as coincidences, but as testaments to the fact that you are meant to still be alive.

I’m only making myself feel worse because I have so many things to do and I’m not doing any of them because I’m lazy and want to lie in bed all day. Then the stress of it all just builds up and the stress paralyzes me into inaction even more and then more stress piles up and so on

I’m digging myself a hole, I’m making myself worse off and ruining my own life

And at the end of the day it’s up to me to fix myself. It’s up to me to get things done and to get my life in order, to make myself happy again

But I know for a fact I can’t do that. I’m too lazy, too tired, can’t focus on anything or anyone other than myself. I’m pathetic 

I’ll never be able to find the will to fix myself so why am I even still here? Just to stay miserable until I inevitably kill myself down the road because I’m incapable of helping myself

Nothing will ever be able to fix me. It’s all up to me. It’s up to me and that’s scary because I’ll never be able to help myself. I can’t, I know for a fact I can’t and I won’t

My mom had BPD, and schizophrenia. My sister is 10. I think this will ruin their life. But we aren't close emotionally. They might also be better without me.

I'm stuck.

I'm scared of all the suffering there are in the world. I've seen street dogs die because of road accident, and there's no one to even take care of the dead body. His hide was there at the road.

,SuicideWatch,"I'm 22 years old. And unlike most of the people here, I truly deserve to kill myself.

I've been verbally and physically abusive to everyone around me since I could talk. 

So far as humans go. I bullied kids when I was a kid. Lots of kids. I was never nice to anyone. I was mean to my parents. I hit. I beat up one of my friends. As an adult, I've been physically and verbally abusive to my mom. I've left her with black eyes. And my stepdad. I've told them both to kill themselves a million times. I've said some truly awful things. Not just to them. I lost a friend after I verbally abused her, too. And I've treated my best friend horribly.

Worse than that, the animals. Both of the first cats I ever had ran away, so I must have done something to them. The third, I chased her around and sprayed her with water and hit her. For years. She was traumatized. She hated me. She'd always scratch me up and I deserved it. The fifth cat ran away, I don't know what I did. The sixth cat I don't remember if I was mean or nice but I gave her to some old ladies because we had to move. I hope they loved her. My seventh cat is my current cat. I got her right before I turned twelve. I used to put a laundry basket over her and shake it while she screamed. She was just a little kitten. I stopped doing that at some point because my mom talked to me. But I hit her. Sometimes multiple times. This cat isn't traumatized mostly. She cuddles me every fucking night that I let her. But...

Then there's my dogs. I beat the shit out of my older dog, multiple times when I was an older teen. I beat him with shoes because he chewed them. He was just sad I had to go to school and I beat him. My younger dog I beat the shit out of once (maybe, technically, twice? same day in a short time period), ever. 1,264 days ago. I was so gutted about how badly I hurt him-- he was bruised under his fur and upset for days-- I swore never to beat any animal ever again, and I haven't. But I still hit them. I'm ""extremely abusive"". That's how my grandma describes me. My fucking grandma. (The dogs aren't traumatized at all anymore, but...)

I also ripped off a lizard's tail...and killed a lizard...but those were accidents. 

On top of all that, it's quite possible I'm a pedophile. When I was 14, I chased an 11 year old girl around trying to kiss her. (I succeeded. This happened 2x.) And when I was 19, I read 2 fanfiction about a sexual relationship between a 16 year old and a 12 year old. And I had dreams for years about rape? Of children? I mean, I also have OCD and it could just be that. But one day I abruptly decided that That Wasn't Going To Happen Anymore, and now it happens much less. It's unpleasant. 

I don't want to be like this. I don't want to be abusive to anyone. I was never abused. I recently started therapy (again). I'm on medication (Paxil). I think about the abuse all the time. It's probably 80% of my thoughts. I am trying to not do these things. To never be verbally or physically abusive again. I love my family and my pets and they have never deserved this. But I will never be able to undo the things that I have done. Even if I try to make amends. Even if I'm forgiven, which I am. I am a bad person, and thanks to what I've done, I will always be.

I deserve every ounce of guilt I've felt these past 1,264 days that I've known I've abusive. These past years where I didn't try to change until now.

,SuicideWatch,"I'm 22. I grew up in an emotionally, verbally, and occasionally physically abusive home. My dad became an alcoholic as a result of the abuse from my mom. I became the unwilling referee and parental therapist as a preteen and eventual side punching bag as a teen. My mom has tried to kill me a few times now - some before I was 18, some after, and also kidnapped me as a child after she and my dad had a fight. I spent all of my adolescence waiting for a chance to get out. CPS came twice but nothing ever helped. I got into a dream school and everything as a senior, but that got ripped away too. Mom refused to sign off on loans - which I could not get without a co-signer. There went my escape. 

They divorced. I became the physical punching bag for my mom. I cut my hair off to prevent her from grabbing it. My dad got worse. I tried to kill myself a few times, all of which failed for some reason or another. Got 51/50'd. My mom proceeded to use that as a threat from then on of where she could send me if I didn't behave. I stayed with my dad after that, and cut her off. Still was depressed as fuck though. Only person I could talk to about any of it was my grandma. One night talked to her and my aunt (who's racist and hates me) happened to also be there. She took the phone and screamed at me. Told me never to call my grandma again, told me to stop making up shit about my family and stop talking suicide to an elder. My grandma could handle it, she used to feel that way too - it's why I could talk to her about it. 

Fast forward a little bit and my dad (just after we finally patched our relationship and things looked better) suddenly died from his drinking problem. I had to go back to my mom because no other relative was an option. My mom immediately took it out on me, and I became terrified to even wake up. She tried to smother me to death, tried to choke me out with an aux cord, tried to shove me down the stairs, tried to push me out of a moving vehicle, etc. Yet every time blamed me. It was the worst year of my life, or so I thought. At least I had my grandma. She was depressed too, over losing her son, and because she was being abused by her daughter (the racist aunt). I was trying to help but it always got covered up somehow. Then exactly one year later, my grandma suddenly died. But she left me half her estate to protect myself, because she wanted me to move out and live near her. She was the only person left that wanted to help me. 

But then my aunt (the one from before) got hissy about the fact that her mom and I were closer than they ever were, and she lawyered up. She refused to give me a key, refused to give me the items my grandma specifically wanted me to have (because no proof), and informed me of the sale well after it happened while I was out of state. She also kept going through my mom, which was idiotic - as my parents divorced and I was an adult. I asked her about it, she dodged, so I wrote a letter. She never contacted me again for months, so I had to get an attorney (that I can't afford tbh) and we've been back and forth on that since. Now she's threatening to file the taxes under my name without my permission without my SSN so the IRS comes after me. All this over fucking recipe cards and a desk!  

I always think about wanting to end it, end the pain, end the inevitable suffering that always comes, but I can't. I can't leave my cats.

&amp;#x200B;

So today, my boss of a year told me she's relocating me. She said it's because of my body odor. She talked to me in January about it and I told her I'm doing my best. She told me today I was doing better but today it's been ""the worse it's been since then.""

I'm absolutely devastated. I have depression and schizophrenia, but I still brush my hair, brush my teeth, use deodorant, and body spray. I don't shower often because I have bad memories of when I was younger, I had severe eczema, and my skin would burn and peel when water touched it. I'm terrified of showers now. 

I know I have a responsibility to take care of myself, but it's so hard when I'm TRYING but no one seems to care that I'm trying. I also know my boss has been stressed lately, but I feel like she forgot what I told her in January and is snapping at me.

She also just sent me an email.

"" In January we had conversation about hygiene one that I had been reluctant to have.  From that conversation I believed that you would rectify the situation. Over the the past few weeks hygiene has become an issue again.

I am not sure if I am able to assist you in figuring out how to go about resolving the problem. What I am sure of is that you are a great member of the team and I want you to continue to work in the office.""

I'm not even sure I want to be here anymore. I was feeling really good about myself today. I changed clothes, used deodorant and body spray, and brushed my hair for the first time in days. I'm also getting my first car tomorrow. I thought that I could have a week where I actually felt hopeful.

I know I'm overreacting, but I just feel horrible about myself. I called my dad crying and he told me it was my fault and that he isn't trying to ""hurt me"". I told him ""I shouldn't have even called anyone."" and hung up. 

I'm just really tired and considering overdosing when I clock out of work today. I have plenty of Zoloft, plenty of BuSpar, and one dose of hydrocodone. I just regret being here because I have my dog here with me on campus. I asked my dad to come and pick me up and he acted like I was asking him to move a mountain for me. Even though I pay for gas and food and bills. So I told him to wait until tomorrow, I just wouldn't go to work tomorrow.

I just really want to die because I feel so awful about myself. I feel like I'm not worthy of love. I feel like I'm not worthy of respect. I'm exhausted. I feel that it would be better if I was dead, so my boss wouldn't have to deal with me.",t2_13yytu,False,,0,False,I'm pretty sure I'm just overreacting,[],r/SuicideWatch,False,0,,0,False,t3_fd1mrm,False,dark,,public,1,0,{},,False,[],,False,False,,{},,False,1,,False,,False,,[],{},,True,,1583298840.0,text,0,,,text,self.SuicideWatch,False,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hi everyone.

,SuicideWatch,"hi, id like some advice if that’s possible. i suffer from extreme anxiety due to environmental and emotional stressors. this makes it extremely difficult to physically sit down and complete schoolwork before the deadline. i also miss a lot of classes because i am scared of confrontation.

just yesterday i submitted a late essay assigned a few weeks back that was half assed and didn’t even meet the page number requirements. this just perpetuates the existing anxiety because now i have to face the teacher tomorrow morning and possibly be questioned about my quality of work. i have a 504 plan but the thought of asking for extensions or additional help makes me feel pathetic.

anxiety + depression + an untreated eating disorder has caused my grades to falter ever since the start of last year . i am a senior in high school and am deathly afraid of being deferred from the colleges that i have been accepted to. the fact that i can’t keep up with high school work suggests that ill fail at college too

i’ve started becoming suicidal due to this. body dysmorphia makes it difficult just to step outside of my house. i have no friends, i am lonely and comfort myself with food, which i usually throw up after. the only people willing to listen to me are adults who are paid to do so

i fear that other people view me as undisciplined and lazy, or just plain stupid. there is no evidence against these perspectives as i keep all of my mental struggles hidden. in reality i am investing all of my energy just to haul my ass out of bed in the morning and get through the day. my mom works long shifts to sustain me but i as her child have nothing to offer in return- no friends or partners to introduce her to, no academic success or improvement, etc. on top of that she has to schedule all of my psych and therapy appointments which is difficult for her as a parent. she’d be better off if i weren’t here to burden her. 

i have a bunch of upcoming psych appointments and have my fingers crossed to be prescribed medicine. maybe i’d sulk less on some zoloft? but i know this isn’t a way out at least not a permanent one.

&lt;p&gt;i fear that other people view me as undisciplined and lazy, or just plain stupid. there is no evidence against these perspectives as i keep all of my mental struggles hidden. in reality i am investing all of my energy just to haul my ass out of bed in the morning and get through the day. my mom works long shifts to sustain me but i as her child have nothing to offer in return- no friends or partners to introduce her to, no academic success or improvement, etc. on top of that she has to schedule all of my psych and therapy appointments which is difficult for her as a parent. she’d be better off if i weren’t here to burden her. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;i have a bunch of upcoming psych appointments and have my fingers crossed to be prescribed medicine. maybe i’d sulk less on some zoloft? but i know this isn’t a way out at least not a permanent one. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;i am tired and want it all to end. i know better than to end my life over a situation i’ll be out of in a few months but i can’t stand the thought of dealing with this any longer.&lt;/p&gt;

,SuicideWatch,"I don't really know what im expecting of righting this but at this point i'm willing to do anything to stop this unbearable pain of existing.

I'm gonna give you a brief overview over my entire life and what exactly it is right now that lead me to the decision that my life is not worth living anymore.

Elementary School was hell. Had a teacher that sat me behind a bookshelf from which i wasnt even able to see the blackboard or participate in class because i was ""distracing"" the other children. The teacher videotaped me ""misbehaving"" in class to ridicule my parents and parentsmeetings. I was a smart kid. I was able to write and do basic math before i went to school. I was bored. When i was finished with my stuff I walked through the room and helped the children that were struggling. I dont see any misbehaving in that but maybe im wrong. Final report card was straight A's. Teacher still recommended that i go to a school for idiots. In my country this recommendation is on the report card. When i applied at ""normal"" schools not a single one wanted to teach me because of that recommendation which was just straigh up bullshit. In the end i found a school that saw my potential and didnt care about the recommendation. So i was able to get a decent education.

While all of that was happening home was hell. My dad was violent and abusive and my mother never intervened when he punched me in the face etc. i dont know if she did not care or if she was afraid. it doesnt matter to me. I felt and still feel abandoned. 

From age 9-12 my older brother was raping me over and over. Not like once a  month or something. EVERY SINGLE DAY. sometimes even multiple times. But who should i have asked for help? my father that is violent me? my mother that doesnt do shit? He even invited his friends to watch and spit on me.

With 14 i had the realization that i wasnt normal anymore. I wasnt talking alot. I stopped enjoying literally anything. Thats also when i started to cut myself.

Fast forward to me being 19. I finished school. Got my highschool diploma eventhough i was suffering from severe depression as i found out later. I also had 1 friend. Lets call her L. I got a job over 100 miles away from my parents. I moved out. Lived there in terrible conditions since i made almost no money. But i think i felt better. Im not sure since i was stoned most of the time. After 3 years living away from my parents L tried to commit suicide. I blame myself but i dont want to get into detail of why that is. She survived. I was there for her. I took all my years vacation to be there for her. 

6 Months later i live with my parents again since i was breaking down and wasnt able to take care of myself anymore. i admit myself to a mental hospital because i was highly suicidal and L urged me to do it. After i admitted myself L blocked me on all social media up to this day. This was 3 years ago. I stayed 3 months in the hospital and learned alot. I learned that i suffer from depression, paranoia, narcissm, have borderline personality disorder and have symptoms that might be a psychosis but no one can confirm or deny this. I was talking about all the stuff that happened to me. But i learned nothing to cope with that stuff. Or accept it. Or stop thinking about it constantly. 

Basically i was worse than before. Everything was fresh in my mind. But no one taught me how to deal with that stuff. But hospital said i was ""healed"".

I moved out from my parents again and got a job in a callcenter since that was the only thing available in my hometown. I got minimum wage, had to have crazy amounts of knowledge, had extreme stats i had to reach or i was laid off and i hated every second. I was sick alot. Like ALOT. Every 2-3 weeks i had something. From colds, flu, migrane etc.

I stayed for a whole year. Eventho i was sick often i had exceptional stats. 99% customer satisfaction with extremely low talk time etc. Then i quit. I couldnt take it anymore. The constant pressure. Knowing that i will never be promoted no matter how good i am. Constant stuggle with money. I was miserable.

So i went into a different mental hospital. Did dialectic behavioural therapy instead of trauma therapy. Learned to use skills. Which is basically just finding something to occupy your brain so you stop thinking your sick sad thoughts. Does it solve anything? No, not at all. Do i feel better? No.

In therapy i found a girlfriend. She is perfect. She talks with me. She is understanding. But im struggling so hard since i have this paranoia that literally any person on this planet is just trying to hurt me. I trust her. I know that my thoughts are not real. But it hurts so fucking much. Just a few days ago she got her period. Almost 2 weeks earlier than expected. My thought process to this situation was. ""Well she was partying with her friends last weekend. She probably fucked a dude there, got Plan-B and one the side effects is that your period might come earlier or later than expected."" Like what the hell? How do you even come up with something like that? I feels like i just want to hurt myself. I should be happy. She is doing everything she can. And i cant appreciate it since my mind is just thinking up storys to hurt me. This literally makes me feel like im insane. Why would i do that to me?

Now im unemployed. Get my money from health insurance. Well for the next week that is. My psychiatrist told me that he wont be writing me sick any longer. He gave me no reason why he wont continue since he is 100% aware of my mental state. That means i dont get any money from my health insurance anymore since they think im healthy. Which means i have to get money from the state for being umemployed. Getting money from the state in my country means that you are required to apply for jobs. For ANY job that the state choses for you. If you dont apply (and show up to interviews or decline a job offer) they wont give you money. Like literally 0.

I cant work. I cant even apply for a job. Im not even able to keep my small flat clean or keep care of myself.

I’ve been fighting my whole life to survive. I was severely abused and neglected as a child. My childhood was a constant battle, being beaten, starved, mentally abused and broken down. 
As a teen I was sexually assaulted at 14 by step brother then my “best friend” at 15. Still being mentally abused by my mother. Which led to a suicide attempt at 16, I took a bottle of Xanax and oxy. Sadly, I was found woke up in the hospital having a tube being shoved down my throat and the taste of charcoal. Soon after I got in a relationship with a man who cut me off from my friends and family. Beat me and made to tell me how worthless I am on a daily basis. Got away at 18 almost 19. Which involved him stalking me and terrorizing me. Ive been struggling with a eating disorder that whole time. At 19 met my soon to be ex husband he was never abusive just clueless, everything I did was never good enough. Never validated my feelings. I had 5 children from 21-29. I left my husband at 30, got in a relationship with another man. Who ended up abusing me. He raped me, beat me, and mentally abused me. He also introduced me to drugs. Now I’ve been struggling with addiction, and an eating disorder. I left him 4 months in that was last year. Pressed charges, my soon to be ex husband has given me a place to stay because he needs the nanny. But his mom is moving in.

Grades are fucking reverse skyrocketing. I CAN'T get myself to sit down and study shit. I'm probably going to fail music, even although I have been taught music in a music school for about 7 years.

And I've also had quite a high number of suicidal thoughts lately. Mostly think of how could I do it...
Think of hanging myself, OD to death, find a gun somewhere (not common at all in my country) and blow my head off, cut myself, tie a rope around my neck and stretch it so hard I die, sealing my swimming pool while turning on the water for it to slowly rise and drown me, put a toaster with me in the bath....

Religion,  Neuroticism , introversion, possible aspergers etc. It is not a simple problem.

I'm a guy. Today is my bday.I bought a can of chlorinated brake cleaner and want to hit it with a welder. That is pretty much what they used in WWI to wipe out the trenches. You smell a fresh cut lawn and a day later you are in a great place. I don't care if I suffer a bit but it is a 100% kill rate. Every single day is suffering for me.

No, I'm not some 19 yo writing this. They have their whole life ahead of them.

Now, it is not like I went out without a fight. In the last few years I watched every self help video. Most were aimed at young guys probably.

I bought clothes.

I have cool hobbies. I work on cars. I fix houses. I like to cook.

I work out. I run and rollerblade - 25 miles is not a problem - I don't even get out of breath. I'm still skinny though and built almost like a teenager. I tried to build muscle but I can't. Men my age look ""substantial."" My neighbor is my age EASILY twice my size. I look at men and I see their wrists and bones, I'm built like a woman. There is something unfixably wrong with me.

I feel like I'm dead and invisible to women. People my age are married with kids and enjoying life. I die inside when I see couples. I missed out on so much in life.  No one even wishes me happy birthday. It is hard to understand what truly being alone is like. It is like death in a way.

I'll never have kids or a family at this point. I just don't want to be the creepy old single man.

I have a computer company and make mid 6 figures, but it brings me zero joy. I'm not trying to brag, and I know other people struggle financially and feel bad but would you want to sit ALONE in front of 4 monitors for 12 hrs a day to make this money? I don't hate the work but why do it if I have no one to share it with?? I feel so alone, like I'm working from hell. I guess people benefit from my work indirectly thru the taxes I pay and the welfare and SNAP they get.

I also feel very alone, and I don't mean the sense of friendships. I'm talking about romantic relationships. I've had about 4 or 5 concussions, and I say that because I know I've definitely had some that weren't diagnosed as I used to box. It's just really hard for me to say what I want to say. I fumble my words a lot, and I noticed that after my most recent concussion about a month ago.

For example, one thing I said that I regret was calling a girl a ""dyke"" because she said something rude to me. What I said was so uncalled for, especially since I knew she was bisexual. I feel like trash because I don't say things like this (homophobic) all the time per-say, but that is just an example of how offensive and unregulated the stuff that comes out of my mouth on the daily.

I constantly have to be high on marijuana most of the time to keep my mood up and I don't want to be like that. The weed just makes things worse for me when I'm not high because I get even more irritable then I was before I smoked and I go through bad anxiety and psychosis episodes.

I also feel like a failure. I am in my senior year of high school and I feel hopeless. My grades are all F's and I don't know what to do anymore. I plan on going to trade school after this year but I probably won't follow through on that because I never follow through on anything I want to do,  as my anxiety prevents me from doing lots of stuff.

I think about suicide but the thought scares me and it's just and endless cycle of just that and it sends me down a dark hole in my thoughts. I feel hopeless like nothing can help me anymore.

Also, I don't want to sound pathetic but its what I am. I told the girl I like that I liked her. She said doesn't reciprocate those feelings but it hurt when she said she liked me 2 years prior. It especially hurt because I liked her back then as well. Once again my anxiety prevents me from being happy and thats all I want, is too be happy again.

,SuicideWatch,"I'm 9 years post the hospitalizations/drug guinea pig era and all the bullshit that comes from not having enough money or insurance to afford professionals that won't prescribe you Jesus or tell you withdrawals don't exist and it's purely psychological. Like, to summarize. I'm 24 now and have managed a normal and social life at school and my restaurant jobs when almost 10 years ago just the thought of leaving my house would give me severe panic attacks. Took a long ass time to fix. I got fit and cute and all that and did the [meetup.com](https://meetup.com) things and socialized with errybody like I learned on the internet and stuff.

A year and a half ago my father suddenly gave me a deadline to leave our apartment. Then pushed it earlier and changed the locks while I was crashing somewhere else. He eventually confessed he's uncomfortable having me in his home because of what I went through and just can't have me around anymore. It's insanely fucked up to have that thrown in your face and then some. ""Our"" became his and everything else his wife's.

When I became homeless periodically this past year, none of my friends or family and family friends helped me when I asked or begged. My relatives cut contact again and most of my friends and people I knew never got back to me while others awkwardly explained how we can't be friends anymore. Even people who knew me personally and what I had gone through just stopped responding to me. In person it was this strange distance from them like I'm a stranger to them. I guess reality started unfolding when things got real. You see your true friends when your heart really needs them.

Unfortunately I had a mental break at work during all this and panicked the fuck out into a depression storm and smashed a glass to use on myself in the back of my restaurant. Everyone was supportive that night and my manager got me in contact with the company's employee support fund stuff to put together money for a deposit for a place and anxiety accommodations at work. The next shifts everybody working there behaved as if I wasn't in the same room and would avoid interacting with me. I was fired a few days later and HR did absolutely nothing. I loved that place and made good money but fucked it up in a snap.

I've been homeless on and off and I couldn't get into any shelters with welfare vouchers or go on SNAP/Section 8, etc because I'm one of those DACA people. The good shelters were always full and the social workers would tell me if I know somewhere I can sleep safe, it's better to do that than the overpopulated homeless shelters here in the NY/NJ metro area. So I'd hide in people's backyards and in abandoned buildings in richer towns at night and hang around parks/libraries during the day. My dad offered to pay rent for my own place for now after he found me sleeping in his garage in 15 degree weather thank fuck for that.

Dozens of online job apps and irl job apps done and still nothing. Then the thoughts come over and over and I don't know what to do. Prozac makes me act on the thoughts while no prozac makes me tolerate them in a panic. I stay off it and just tolerate panicking and crying it away. I can't afford school and my own place while working full-time and don't have enough money to renew my DACA. Future is fucked up. The one support I got doesn't wanna talk to me and pays to keep me away. Oof. My mind calmed down after turning this into a vent..

&lt;p&gt;When I became homeless periodically this past year, none of my friends or family and family friends helped me when I asked or begged. My relatives cut contact again and most of my friends and people I knew never got back to me while others awkwardly explained how we can&amp;#39;t be friends anymore. Even people who knew me personally and what I had gone through just stopped responding to me. In person it was this strange distance from them like I&amp;#39;m a stranger to them. I guess reality started unfolding when things got real. You see your true friends when your heart really needs them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately I had a mental break at work during all this and panicked the fuck out into a depression storm and smashed a glass to use on myself in the back of my restaurant. Everyone was supportive that night and my manager got me in contact with the company&amp;#39;s employee support fund stuff to put together money for a deposit for a place and anxiety accommodations at work. The next shifts everybody working there behaved as if I wasn&amp;#39;t in the same room and would avoid interacting with me. I was fired a few days later and HR did absolutely nothing. I loved that place and made good money but fucked it up in a snap.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve been homeless on and off and I couldn&amp;#39;t get into any shelters with welfare vouchers or go on SNAP/Section 8, etc because I&amp;#39;m one of those DACA people. The good shelters were always full and the social workers would tell me if I know somewhere I can sleep safe, it&amp;#39;s better to do that than the overpopulated homeless shelters here in the NY/NJ metro area. So I&amp;#39;d hide in people&amp;#39;s backyards and in abandoned buildings in richer towns at night and hang around parks/libraries during the day. My dad offered to pay rent for my own place for now after he found me sleeping in his garage in 15 degree weather thank fuck for that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dozens of online job apps and irl job apps done and still nothing. Then the thoughts come over and over and I don&amp;#39;t know what to do. Prozac makes me act on the thoughts while no prozac makes me tolerate them in a panic. I stay off it and just tolerate panicking and crying it away. I can&amp;#39;t afford school and my own place while working full-time and don&amp;#39;t have enough money to renew my DACA. Future is fucked up. The one support I got doesn&amp;#39;t wanna talk to me and pays to keep me away. Oof. My mind calmed down after turning this into a vent..  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;TL;DR: Went from mental health recovery and becoming a new person to homeless hot mess without access to welfare or family support.&lt;/p&gt;

,SuicideWatch,"My mom is my biggest supporter but also the most sensitive and emotional person there is. When I want her to cheer me up, she starts crying too because she’s so empathetic and it ends up being me who has to cheer HER up. She doesn’t mean to, it just happens. I love her to death but her emotions often comes first. Which makes me not wanna talk to her about my health at all.

I turned 16 yesterday, but I feel like my life is going by way too fast. I’m gay, have no friends and all I do is lie in bed and cry. 

Because I’m gay, I’ll never experience the feeling of having a teenage romance. I’ll never get asked to prom. I’ll never glance at a guy in my class and get a smile or a glance back. I’d say I’m fairly handsome to my knowledge and I try to care for others so it’s not that I’m undateable. It’s just that “everybody’s straight until proven gay”, if you know what I mean.

I just wanna live in a world where I can ask for a guys number without him being weirded out because “he’s not a homo”.

My life is going by way too fast. I’m afraid I’ll be alone forever. I’m impatient. I know I’m only 16. But I’m already so tired of this life. I’m missing out on so much the other straight kids my age are doing. I wanna live their simple life, but obviously I can’t. 

I’m just so tired of everything. I want it to end. I want to believe that I’ll be reborn as a straight guy or girl. To fall in love and having a chance with them. I want to live that life. I want to live an easy life with the only struggle being that the screen on my phone has a crack. I don’t believe in it, I just wish that’s what happens when you die.

But I can’t take my life. I could never do that to my mom. As I said: she’s emotional. She would be heartbroken. She’s been depressed before and I’m certain she would grow into old habits if I were to disappear. 

Sometimes I just wish she would die so I could take my life without hurting her. It’s awful and I’m ashamed to be writing this. I just want everything to end. I want everything to end with my mom.

I regret my entire life and I know when I take my last breath no matter if it’s by my own hand or not I’ll regret my life. What’s stopping me now is I know if I did it it would probably kill my dad and I don’t want that. I have a daughter too but I feel like she would be better without me because why would you want to have a mom like me? I’m just a doormat for everyone and I go where people tell me. Whenever I ask for help I get it thrown back in my face so what’s the point anymore. I don’t sacrifice enough they say even though I don’t have a life anymore I don’t even have room to breathe I love her but is it selfish too selfish to wish I hd jsut a few hours a week to do something productive for myself. Just get rid of the noise and let me breathe again Why can’t I? I’ve already asked for help but no no it’s just me. It’s all my fault. It’s my fault for not making time for myself but no one seems to understand no matter how much I explain or how much I ask for help. I’m breaking down why doesn’t anyone understand that Doormat doormat even when I stand up for myself to try and not be a doormat the shit gets stomped even deeper into every fiber of my being it feels like agony agony agony. I regret everything I’m fucking miserable miserable miserable. I wish I never existed I wish I never made these ties life is awful, why would anyone ever do this to a sentient creature. Life is so fuckkng  horrible. It’s been so long now I’ve been living like this and it’s agony what a terrible mother I am can’t sacrifice enough, just wish I never existed and I never knew anyone and no one ever knew me&lt;/p&gt;
