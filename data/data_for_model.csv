"Our most-broken and least-understood rules is ""helpers may not invite private contact as a first resort"", so we've made a new wiki to explain it","We understand that most people who reply immediately to an OP with an invitation to talk privately  mean only to help, but this type of response usually leads to either disappointment or disaster.  it usually works out quite differently here than when you say ""PM me anytime"" in a casual social context.  

We have huge admiration and appreciation for the goodwill and good citizenship of so many of you who support others here and flag inappropriate content - even more so because we know that so many of you are struggling yourselves.  We're hard at work behind the scenes on more information and resources to make it easier to give and get quality help here - this is just a small start.  

Our new wiki page explains in detail why it's much better to respond in public comments, at least until you've gotten to know someone.  It will be maintained at /r/depression/wiki/private_contact, and the full text of the current version is below.

*****

###Summary###

**Anyone who, while acting as a helper, invites or accepts private contact (I.e. PMs, chat, or any kind of offsite communication) early in the conversion is showing either bad intentions or bad judgement.  Either way, it's unwise to trust them.** 


""PM me anytime"" seems like a kind and generous offer. And it might be perfectly well-meaning, but, unless and until a solid rapport has been established, it's just not a wise idea.  Here are some points to consider before you offer or accept an invitation to communicate privately.

* **By posting supportive replies publicly, you'll help more people than just the OP. If your responses are of good quality, you'll educate and inspire other helpers.** [The 1-9-90 rule](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1%25_rule_(Internet_culture\)) applies here as much as it does anywhere else on the internet.  

* People who are struggling with serious mental-health issues often (justifiably) have a low tolerance for disappointment and a high-level of ever-changing emotional need. **Unless the helper is able to make a 100% commitment to be there for them in every way, for as long as necessary, offering a personal inbox as a resource is likely to do more harm than good.** This is why mental-health crisis-line responders usually don't give their names and callers aren't allowed to request specific responders.  It's much healthier and safer for the callers to develop a relationship with the agency as a whole.  Analogously, it's much safer and healthier for our OPs to develop a relationship with the community as a whole.  Even trained responders are generally not allowed to work high-intensity situations alone.  It's partly about availability, but it's mostly about wider perspective and preventing compassion fatigue. 

* **If a helper gets in over their head with someone whose mental-health issues (including suicidality, which is often comorbid with depression) escalate, in a PM conversation it's much harder for others, including the /r/depression and /r/SuicideWatch moderators to help**.  (Contrary to common assumptions, moderators can't see or police PMs.)  

* In our observation over many years, the people who say ""PM me"" the most are consistently the ones with the least understanding of mental-health issues and mental-health support. We all have gaps in our knowledge and in our ability to communicate effectively.  Community input mitigates these limitations. **There's no reason why someone who's truly here to help would want to hide their responses from community scrutiny**.  If helpers are concerned about their own privacy, keep in mind that self-disclosure, when used supportively, is more about the feelings than the details, and that we have no problem here with the use of alt/throwaway accounts, and have no restrictions on account age or karma.  

*  We all know the internet is used by some people to exploit or abuse others.  These people *do* want to hide their deceptive and manipulative responses from everyone except their victims. There are many of them who specifically target those who are vulnerable because of mental-health issues. **If a helper invites an OP to talk privately and gives them a good, supportive experience, they've primed that person to be more vulnerable to abusers.** This sort of cognitive priming tends to be particularly effective when someone's in a state of mental-health crisis, when people rely more on heuristics than critical reasoning.

* If OPs want to talk privately, posting on a wide-open anonymous forum like reddit might not be the best option. Although we don't recommend it, we do allow OPs to request private contact when asking for support. If you want to do this, please keep your expectations realistic, and to have a careful look at the history of anyone who offers to PM before opening up to them.",SQLwitch,133,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/doqwow/our_mostbroken_and_leastunderstood_rules_is/,understand people reply immediately op invitation talk privately mean help type

"I hate it so much when you try and express your feelings to your parents, but they turn it around and compare your suffering with theirs.","I've been feeling really depressed and lonely lately from my job, I'm a full time late night janitor for a courthouse just 10 miles away from my hometown. Working there has been pretty easy, but I wound up feeling super lonely a lot considering I don't really get to talk to my friends or hang out with them much.

So just today I came home late as usual, and I have a little interaction with my mom after she made a joke to me that I took pretty personal and felts like was more of an insult rather than a sense of humor. I told her that I didn't really want to joke around like that, but she refused to listen and told me to just go away then. Despite attempting to change the topic and explain why I haven't been feeling so high, all she kept doing was telling what a great mom she is for raising me and my brother while struggling to make ends meet and keep the house. What an ungrateful little bastard I am for not appreciating her hard work and sacrifices. 

At that moment I was legitimately about to begin to cry. But rather instead of pausing and trying to reverse the damages, all my mom did was host a little parental style of the oppression Olympics and proclaim her amount of tears and cries over the course of three weeks. I got out just before my first tear would legitimately run down my cheek. 

And even before I went to bed, she goes on about how her life is more worse than ours than ours, then escalates into a more ""This is why you'd make a terrible mistake getting behind the wheel"" considering I had practice driving this morning. Unaware that she had just lite the fuse to trigger the firework, but she didn't seem to care. 

Thanks for reading, I hope you feel better soon and find the key to unlocking your next set of happiness. Along with having a parent who doesn't make your suffering all about them and why you shouldn't be depressed.",TheNewKiller69,8,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/fedwbi/i_hate_it_so_much_when_you_try_and_express_your/,feeling really depressed lonely lately job full time late night janitor courthouse 10 mile away hometown working ha pretty easy wound feeling super lonely lot considering really get talk friend hang much today came home late usual little interaction mom made joke took pretty personal felt like wa insult rather sense humor told really want joke around like refused listen told go away despite attempting change topic explain feeling high kept wa telling great mom raising brother struggling make end meet keep house ungrateful little bastard appreciating hard work sacrifice moment wa legitimately begin cry rather instead pausing trying reverse damage mom wa host little parental style oppression olympics proclaim amount tear cry course three week got first tear would legitimately run cheek even went bed go life worse escalates make terrible mistake getting behind wheel considering practice driving morning unaware lite fuse trigger firework seem care thanks reading hope feel better soon find key unlocking next set happiness along parent make suffering depressed,hate much try express feeling parent turn around compare suffering,new killer 69,1866,137,new killer 69 feeling really depressed lonely lately job full time late night janitor courthouse 10 mile away hometown working ha pretty easy wound feeling super lonely lot considering really get talk friend hang much today came home late usual little interaction mom made joke took pretty personal felt like wa insult rather sense humor told really want joke around like refused listen told go away despite attempting change topic explain feeling high kept wa telling great mom raising brother struggling make end meet keep house ungrateful little bastard appreciating hard work sacrifice moment wa legitimately begin cry rather instead pausing trying reverse damage mom wa host little parental style oppression olympics proclaim amount tear cry course three week got first tear would legitimately run cheek even went bed go life worse escalates make terrible mistake getting behind wheel considering practice driving morning unaware lite fuse trigger firework seem care thanks reading hope feel better soon find key unlocking next set happiness along parent make suffering depressed hate much try express feeling parent turn around compare suffering

This world has no place for people like me.,"A bit of context. I'm an American. I'm black. I'm big. I'm ugly. And I'm autistic. I work as an aircraft mechanic.

The more I go through every day, the less I see the point of continuing with this life. No one who's gotten to know me as a person wants anything to do with me. People make fun of my quirks all the time - they think they're being funny, but they're being obnoxious. Besides that, the only friends I still have are the ones in high school, who are now so far away. My father, the man who cared about me more than anyone else did, passed away a few years ago from sudden heart and kidney failure, while I was waiting on a connecting flight to visit him.

Besides that, people will only connect with me as much as they need to. I clearly have problems that I do not know how to address. No amount of therapy has fixed those issues.

People cross the street when they see me on the sidewalk. Society here in general doesn't like people like me, with so many people supporting an openly racist president as we regress. I know that I won't ever be able to rely on the cops for anything, because I'm likely to get shot before they figure out what the issue is. I've been racially profiled many times when I lived in New York City. I happened to be stopped for every ""random"" drug search whenever I took the Staten Island ferry while carrying a backpack.

That being the case, the only value of any sort I can provide to society is in the job I do. I'm also doing vocational training for a higher qualification, but every day I'm questioning more and more why I care. More money isn't going to fix me as a person.

The truth is, I'm a mistake. I learned a few years ago that I was adopted at birth. Probably before my new parents knew I would be as difficult as I was. I should've been aborted or left to die.

The prognosis for our world grows more dire every day due to global warming facilitated by old people who don't give a shit about us. There is no reason to believe things will get better - people reject science more and more, and we are going backwards.

Before long, I will have a gun. It will allow me to protect myself where I know law enforcement won't. But it'll also give me the power to choose when I want to die. That, at the very least, will give me peace of mind - knowing I have a way out whenever I need it.

I'm not some ""starving kid in Africa"" or whatever other bullshit people push to those who are discontented, but I have still been dealt a pretty shitty hand in life. I see no reason to keep bothering with it when so many things are wrong with me, and our future will only get worse.",InsertANameHeree,2,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/fegd6t/this_world_has_no_place_for_people_like_me/,bit context american black big ugly autistic work aircraft mechanic go every day le see point continuing life one gotten know person want anything people make fun quirk time think funny obnoxious besides friend still one high school far away father man cared anyone else passed away year ago sudden heart kidney failure wa waiting connecting flight visit besides people connect much need clearly problem know address amount therapy ha fixed issue people cross street see sidewalk society general like people like many people supporting openly racist president regress know ever able rely cop anything likely get shot figure issue racially profiled many time lived new york city happened stopped every random drug search whenever took staten island ferry carrying backpack case value sort provide society job also vocational training higher qualification every day questioning care money going fix person truth mistake learned year ago wa adopted birth probably new parent knew would difficult wa aborted left die prognosis world grows dire every day due global warming facilitated old people give shit u reason believe thing get better people reject science going backwards long gun allow protect know law enforcement also give power choose want die least give peace mind knowing way whenever need starving kid africa whatever bullshit people push discontented still dealt pretty shitty hand life see reason keep bothering many thing wrong future get worse,world ha place people like,insert name e,2622,43,insert name e bit context american black big ugly autistic work aircraft mechanic go every day le see point continuing life one gotten know person want anything people make fun quirk time think funny obnoxious besides friend still one high school far away father man cared anyone else passed away year ago sudden heart kidney failure wa waiting connecting flight visit besides people connect much need clearly problem know address amount therapy ha fixed issue people cross street see sidewalk society general like people like many people supporting openly racist president regress know ever able rely cop anything likely get shot figure issue racially profiled many time lived new york city happened stopped every random drug search whenever took staten island ferry carrying backpack case value sort provide society job also vocational training higher qualification every day questioning care money going fix person truth mistake learned year ago wa adopted birth probably new parent knew would difficult wa aborted left die prognosis world grows dire every day due global warming facilitated old people give shit u reason believe thing get better people reject science going backwards long gun allow protect know law enforcement also give power choose want die least give peace mind knowing way whenever need starving kid africa whatever bullshit people push discontented still dealt pretty shitty hand life see reason keep bothering many thing wrong future get worse world ha place people like
I’m not even worthy of being counted during attendance.,"I go to a small school, normally no more than 20 students are in a classroom, yet my teachers don’t even realize I’m in their class most of the time. I have amazing teachers, and they always want to help students learn, but I’m always forgotten about. I’m not slow enough to need special help, I’m not smart enough to need no help though. I’m pretty quiet, and I almost always get interrupted by loud people. If I actually work up the nerve to ask a question in my asshole-filled classes, the teacher gets distracted by two idiots trying to kill each other and forgets about me. 

I know I probably sound like a spoiled child that just wants attention, but I don’t.

"8 years ago, I posted here, wanting to die. My life is so much better now.","When I was 15-16 years old, I posted here in my darkest moments. I couldn't see any reason to keep living. I thought I was nothing special and the next 8 years seemed like an endless slog. You can look through my post history if you want. 

Since then, I graduated college and graduate school. I have traveled the world. I swam with bioluminescent algae in Indonesia. I've hiked among alpacas in Peru. I learned to speak Spanish fluently and connected with people around the world and in my own country, who speak Spanish too. I've published my writing i  multiple publications. I have fallen in love and had my heart broken several times. I realized I'm gay, came out, and I'm with the most amazing woman. I have a career that I love where I help people every day. I can honestly say that depression may be a lifelong struggle for me, but it is possible to recover and develop tools to cope with it. Every day is a manageable challenge now. Every day I am grateful to just be alive. I am SO GLAD that I didn't kill myself 8 years ago. I never would have known how beautiful my life could become.

Can I leave some baggage here,"Im not sure if this is the place to post this but here we go. Apologies in advance this is going to be all over the place, im on mobile and im lost. Not real names, this is a throw away etc etc etc.
Okay so im 22 M I guess I've been dealing with depression for about 8 years. I have anxiety , I'm self conscious and I like to believe im more fucked up than I actually am and if it's okay here I'd like to get it off my chest and talk about my life and where I am now to no one in particular.
I was never the popular kid. I was known but never popular. I was the kid that got picked last for sports or games, never got to play soccer with the other kids because I wasnt good enough, wasnt included in tag or hide and go seek, but I pressed on not knowing what the other kids were bullying me. I got to play lego or slap jack, tic tac toe, you name it, I played by myself. I had about 3 or 4 friends for most of primary school (kindergarten-grade 3). Not knowing how to interact with the other kids I was lonely. I didnt realize I was lonely as it was well normal for me. The world was out to get me and I let it, I had no voice. I didnt know how to stand up to myself for fear of hurting the other person for telling them how I felt. I was never taught how to show emotions or how to use them. Interpret them. I know what they look like and how they feel but showing them? Using them? You'd have better luck getting a volcano to spew water. But this is how I was brought up and its what I knew. Life for me was like looking through beer goggles for everyone else it was distorted and I had a fake image of what it was. Because of this I matured faster in other aspects of life. I grasped adult concepts earlier than most and grew into them. Into worrying about what others think of me, always comparing myself to EVERYONE else, not just the best or the people above me but everyone. I felt like everyone hated me and thought I was some annoying kid so I shut myself off from the world. That's the first few years of life. I ran around as a ""happy"" lonely kid. As I grew up and was about 10 or 11 I learned to read people and guess what they were feeling/thinking, how their day was going n shit. I learned to feed off of everyone's emotions around me rather than feeling my own. I essentially shut off my own emotions without realizing it and now I'm struggling with fixing it. I fed off of the kids that were happy and replicated their happiness as my own, I imitated them and copied them to feel included. I grew up like this trying to fill that big empty lonely hole I felt, i buried it deep down and (as a green swamp friend of mine once said) I became an onion, I made layers to try to hide it but nothing seemed to work. (Sorry this post has kinda became a pity party it was not my Intention, fuck it let's continue) the next couple years of my life pretty much continued on like this, building my wall of fake emotions to ""protect"" everyone else from my greatest enemy... myself, I didnt trust myself to not fuck up, didnt trust myself to really connect with anyone. I lied to everyone around me and pushed anyone away that tried to get close or learn who really was on the inside. It was repulsive and wrong but I didnt know that. I would say this is when I got my first taste of depression around the age of 12. Grades 5-7 I was the class runt/Guinne pig/doormat, I was the kid being bullied. The other kids unanimously decided I was the kid they picked on. Fucking private religious bullshit school did nothing to prevent what they were doing to me nor did they seem to care hell even the TEACHERS  would pick on me. So I accepted ""who I was"" and that was the school fuck up. I tried to take their name tag and wear it with pride. Yea it worked for a bit as armor. I made myself insensitive to the bullying for the first little bit. But grade 6 is when the smack down really started to happen and I became... the germ. These kids had gotten the idea to give me the permanent cheese touch or the germ as they liked to call it. This was the tipping point for me. All my so called classmates and friends I had suddenly turned on me and I was alone. Truly alone, left half dead for the vultures to pick at. I broke. I broke into so many little pieces, all those people I grew up around people I trusted turned. I couldn't touch anyone with out them screaming ""DONT TOUCH ME GERM"" ""GREAT THANKS NOW I HAVE TO WASH MYSELF"" and other hurtful shit like that. They couldn't even sit in a chair I had used without washing it and sanitizing it. Okay I say I was alone but I had 2 friends, payton and dane, they tried to help they tried everything they could but the other kids wouldn't back down. Half way thru the school year I attempted suicide. I had the steak knife pointed at my heart and started pushing, I drew a little blood but it hurt to much so I stuck around. I had only told dane and he kept it quite for a while like I asked him to but one day he told me that he had to tell the teacher, it wasnt something he liked knowing and didnt like how close I was to not being here. So he told that I wasnt feeling good in my head, that I was going thru some tough times due to the class and what they were doing. This teacher had 0 clue that it was happening and immediately went to the principal. Brought me with her and told me to tell her what was going on. I played dumb for so long hoping that it would just end. I didnt want to deal with it but they persisted and eventually brought dane in and asked him what was up. After he started to say something I broke, I told them almost everything. About me wanting to die, not wanting to live and how I wished everyone else would die first. I didnt tell them how i had attempted suicide. My worst fears had come true, I spoke up and now everyone hated me. They couldn't bully me but did they hate me. After the whole class got a ripped a new ass hole for pushing a kid to suicidal thoughts (yes I told them I had thoughts, no I didnt tell them I tried) I came back into the class room and I'm greeted with silence and stone cold eyes staring back at me. The first thing this kid told me (who I thought was one of the people that I had as an acquaintance) ""You know OP fuck you, you go and cry to the principal that we dont treat you nicely well guess what? You want us to treat you with dignity and respect well how about trying to treat us that way? Next time think before you speak"". I can't tell you how much this affected me. That kid got sent home for the rest of the week. This is supposed to be where that part of the story ends right? No those fuckers came back the next and kept calling me the germ, kept bullying me and bullied me harder than before. Grade 7 was a repeat of grade 6. Aging more and more I hid more and more of my emotions and just kept feeding off others and relying on them for how to react in different situations. Elementary school behind me and moving to middle school I made new friends, a new chapter in life. Friendsthat didnt judge, one guy even had the same name as me ""mysteriouslyreddited"". I started to notice girls at this point too. Two girls in particular, quinn and Anna. Quinn is a couple years younger than I had been babysat by my mother and I by her mother, they switched out as they both worked. And she, well Quinn's amazing, pretty no beautiful, shes got these eyes that just, her hair... wow. And her smile (._. ) just everything. She was my first crush although quickly forgotten (we went to different schools. You know out of sight out of mind. K not like that but I hadn't seen her in a while). Anna on the other had, well I can describe her similarly, but things were different with anna. They were. Easier??? Its. Well she was the girl I fell head over heels for and she knew it. We talked for hours upon hours but it was never meant to be. I continued on the same way I did in elementary school, by wearing armor and growing my onion. Anna and I stayed close for a couple years me being wrapped around her finger while she went after other guys. I got her a couple boyfriends reluctantly, I Introduced her to a couple guys I knew she was crushing on and I enjoyed watching her be with them (as i look back i was feeding off of her boyfriends emotions and mixed them with my own. Bad idea 0/10 would recommend.) And well this went as well as you may guess, it went great. WRONG. I was confused and shut off, shut down and shot down. I don't remember what started a fight between us but it went on for months. It became personal for the both of us. I told her not to come to my funeral she told me to fuck off and go die, words were said damage was done and I thought I was okay with it. I learned quickly that I in fact was not okay and my fight with her had broken my armour and I was bare, everything was out and we both fell into depression because of what we did to each other. I was having more and more suicidal thoughts. I had spiraled to my lowest point that I've ever been, self harm, alchohol, skipping school, it was the worst part of my life. Highschool is the hardest for everyone isnt it?? Its not oof my bad. I was skipping school, fighting with my mothers husband, smoking pot and drinking waaaaay to much booze. The fall out of not having anna in my life was ruining me, yes I felt for her and yes i wanted her back in my life but the hatred for her at the same time was almost outweighing the good I felt for her. I cut everyday for over 2 years. I didnt know what to do, the pain felt good and brought me out of my head and prevented me about thinking about anything as long as the blade was on me. My entire depressive episode was brought on because I couldn't stand up for myself or tell myself it's okay or when to stop. I lost myself, lost my armor, lost everything. Or at least I thought I lost everything when in reality I was only just discovering life. I became cold and truly shut off my emotions and didnt even feed off others. I became a robot. I woke up late went to school skipped all my classes, went home played COD or skyrim and went to bed. Rinse repeat and that's how I lived from day to day, month to month, for a couple years. I still haven't reconnected with anna (anna if you end up reading this im sorry for the bad memories. I like to think that we still have some love left for each other but i know that's false). As I lived like this my family life started to become stretched and strained. Being brought up as a christian I was told to believe in god, that hes the answer to all and just ask him for help. I called bullshit and that if he truly cared that none of us would suffer, if we suffer then why the fuck did jesus die on the cross for us? My grandparents and mother didnt take kindly to these words and how dare I speak about god in that manor. After mass one sunday i would have been like 15 we were at the grandparents and the topic of vacations came up and how I hadn't been on one in years and I'd like to go when peeps went down to visit cousins from another town a days drive away. It was spring break and they were leaving next weekend. I inquired if I could go with them and because of my grades I was told no. I told them if they let me go I'd pick up the pace in school and i would try, but only if they let me go. Well my attitude needed to be fixed because the next thing I know my mother is yelling at me and telling me how entitled I am and that Id be lucky to consider even going. Me being the teen I was I yelled back. Fuck yous were exchanged. My grandfather had enough and tried to manhandle me, no fucking chance gramps not in my current state. We had a fist fight that ended up with him having broken glasses, he litterally ripped my shirt off me, ripped my necklace off and threw me into a door and him thrown onto the floor. He got up and started to yell ""get the fuck out of here, you can come back when your damn well ready to apologize until then get out!!!!"". I replied with ""well then I guess it wasnt nice knowing you. When you're ready to get your grandson back track me down and tell me how sorry you are"" and left without looking back. He did track me down the next day and told me he was sorry about how he reacted and stepping so far out of line. That night after we made up and got a blizzard I went home to find my mother's husband fuming because of how I talked to my mother which cause a fight with him. That was the night I lost my home, my family, he had disowned me and cast me out like garbage. Even tho that was one of my lowest points I didnt see it as a loss. Yea i was fucked but i was also free to do what I want when I want. So I started working on myself. I moved to a new city enrolled in a new school and started fresh. While I did climb out of my depressing hole I have yet to beat depression. I got a great girlfriend and living large now adays . Started some anti depressants, counseling and what not. Well now Im gonna skip ahead to why I wanted to get some baggage off my back. A few weeks ago I went out to the bar with some friends and I ran into none other than quinn. I'd had some pregame drinks, had some drinks while I was there. I didnt eat anything that day, was already dehydrated and alcohol should not be consumed like that while on meds. So I was already drunk, feeling great, I'd seen quinn once and didnt know what to say so I just smiled and ""ignored"" her. Well let me tell you it was so fucking hard to ignore her. I mean if you were me you'd find it impossible to. So I did what any drunk man does, i had a shot and approached her, asked if I could buy her a drink and  From what I remember we hit it off. I had a blast but tbh I was not looking for anything in her I just remembe how I used to feel but more Importantly j remembered all the fun times we use to have growing up and all the memories with her over the years. I was.. no i am lonely and she seemed to just kinda be there. So we were talking, and I looked at her and time just seemed to stop. We talked but I don't remember what it was about. At one point I asked if I could kiss her. My self conscience was screaming at me telling me this was not okay but the alchohol was in too deep. There is so much that I wish I could remember about that night but I cant. I dont know what happened what I said or did. This is the hardest I've had to fight this depression in a long time and this time I'm worried that I won't be able to win. I don't recognize who I am anymore. I dont like this person I've become. I love my GF but I feel like I'm going to drag her down and make her depressed like me. I feel like I'm not good enough for her and I'm hurting her by being with her. I cant stop thinking about quinn but I think I fucked up even trying to be friends with her. There was a small spark there but nothing major besides I dont want there to be a spark right now, I've talked to my GF and she knows I have feelings for another. It was hard to deal with at first but after we talked about it she knows that im struggling with my feelings and that I'm not looking for a way to leave her. I've been on the verge of relapsing and going back to self harm. Im not crossing that line because when I do there's no turning back. Im tired of being depressed and I want out but he hardest part is figuring out who i am and if I can keep all my current bridges or if I have to go out and build new bridges. Im gonna keep trudging on and finding my way thru this fucked up place we call earth. Again im sorry this was so long and all over the place, if you read it thanks for listening, if you skip over this story thanks for not wasting your time (that came out wrong but ov well). I'm not looking for help I just need to talk to someone. I am doing okay I just had so much pent up I needed a release.

Letter from my girlfriend,"&amp;#x200B;

My girlfriend wrote me this letter and agreed to share it here... 

&amp;#x200B;

Letter to my depressed lover.

I see you. I know you’re in there. The man who loved and sought joy, the man who felt

deserving of happiness. He is blindfolded, held hostage, cold and chained in a windowless

basement, by a tyrant who thrives off suffering. At times it feels like there is no hope, at

times it feels like there is no escape. You are weakened, the exhaustion has taken over your

body, your mind and your soul, you question whether you’ll ever be strong enough to fight

this mighty tyrant, to escape from his grip, out of the darkness. Will you ever be able to feel

the sun stroking your skin again? Will you ever see the light again? Will you ever feel love

again?

Why are you here? How did you get here? You never asked for this, no one would.

A tyrant is an illegitimate ruler who controls through oppression. Tyranny is not fair, it is not

understanding, and it is cruel. The tyrant wants to weaken you until you have no choice but

to succumb, he will brainwash you until you come to terms with his reign, until you are no

longer a threat to him. The tyrant wants you to think that he is too strong to ever beat, too

mighty to outthink, too present to escape.

But let me tell you something about Tyrants. Anger, hate, always stems from fear, and pain.

Behind every tyrant is a hurt child. Behind every tyrant is a voice that was once unheard, a

heart that was once broken, eyes that were once blinded. The tyrant doesn’t want you to

see the light, because the light was once taken from him, he doesn’t want you to know love,

because love was once taken from him, and he wants you to hurt, because he hurts.

But how can tyranny be defeated? When tyranny is defeated by force, it often just paves

the way for another form of tyranny. You don’t want to kill your tyrant, you’ll be left with

blood on your hands and trauma in your soul, if you kill you’ll have to hide, and what is the

point of fighting your way out of the darkness, just to make your way into another form of

darkness?

No. Your tyrant won’t be defeated by force. He will be defeated by love, and I know that

your love is strong enough to turn him around.

The man that I love finds joy in the little things, the touch of the grass against his feet, the

sight of birds in the trees, the sound of a stick falling on icy water. The man that I love is

surprising, he is unapologetically original, passionate, and doted of a natural humour. The

man that I love is caring and has an emotional intelligence that can make anyone around

him feel seen, heard, and loved. The man that I love is wise, he can offer advice that you

never knew you needed, and he can be the ray of sunshine in anyone’s day. The man that I

love will lighten up entire rooms and soothe even your deepest worries with care and

attention. The man that I love, can love so strongly, so unconditionally, so powerfully, that

he can make anyone’s darkness fade away. So, if anyone is going to bring this tyrant down,

it will be the man that I love.

Love can make your tyrant feel seen, it can make him feel comfortable enough to talk,

comfortable enough to tell you about what pain led him to tyranny. When faced with love,

with a powerful, unconditional love, and an acceptance that is free of all judgment, your

&amp;#x200B;

tyrant will be able to start facing up to his actions, he will be able to start realising that all

along he was causing you to suffer for reasons that had nothing to do with you, they were

never your fault, he was only causing you to suffer, because he was suffering. When that

realisation will spring upon him, he will remove your blindfold and you will see that you are

facing yourself. But don’t worry, it’s just a mask the tyrant originally wore to trouble you, he

won’t wish to do that anymore though, he’ll unchain you and remove his mask, and you will

realise that all along, your tyrant was only a child. Suddenly the anger you felt towards your

tyrant will vanish, because you are a man who is fair, just and loving, you are a man who

doesn’t believe in punishment nor revenge, you are a man who can forgive. You are a man

who can recognise when a child simply needs to be held, loved and nurtured.

So you will take the child’s hand. At first, he will be fearful, he has been hurt before, who’s

to say that you won’t hurt him? But you will give him your word, you will promise him that

he is safe with you, and deep in your heart, you will know that you are telling the truth. The

child will weep in your arms, and you will hold him tighter, you will tell him that he is loved,

he is heard, he is seen, and that from this moment forward, he will never be alone.

You will come out of the basement with the child, hand in hand. And although at first it will

feel like a relief, it won’t be easy. You haven’t seen the sun in so long, its light will feel

blinding and uncomfortable, your body will still feel weak, and as you’ll barely feel able to

look after yourself, you’ll start to wonder how you could possibly look after this child? But

you will surprise yourself. Through the small pleasures you once enjoyed, such as feeling the

cool grass underneath your feet, you will find strength. Enough strength to lift yourself up,

carry the child, and start walking. It will be challenging, and you’ll worry that each step

might be your last step, you’ll worry that you might fall and never find the strength to get

back up, but you’ll keep putting a foot in front of the other, until it starts to feel natural.

Eventually you’ll look up and realise that the sun isn’t as blinding as it was when you first

came out, you’ll see a path, and you’ll know how to get home.

On your way home, you will worry that bringing this child back might be too much of a

burden for me. What if I don’t want him? What if I don’t love him? After all he was once a

tyrant, how could I love him? And what if I don’t even love you anymore? You’ve been gone

for so long, what if I’ve stopped waiting? What if I’ve given up? What if I’ve found someone

else? What if I just end up hurting you and the child more than you’ve both already been

hurt?

But all this time, I’ve been waiting for you. I’ve been worrying, I’ve been crying, you

disappeared so suddenly I never understood what had happened. I made it my mission to

find you, I was up day and night trying to save you, I called on you a thousand times, I

searched for clues in every corner, I even tried to negotiate with your tyrant, but to no avail,

it only angered him more. I tried to get help, but no one could help me, and in the end, I was

left weakened. That’s when I realised that I was exhausting myself, and I wasn’t helping you.

So I did the only thing I could do. I stopped trying to save you and trusted that you would be

able to save yourself, and as I waited for you to do that, I held our space, I nourished our

space so that you could come back to a loving and nurturing home, one where you could

one day feel whole again and heal.

&amp;#x200B;

When you come home, I will welcome your little boy with open arms, and love him, just as I

learned to love the little girl who once held me hostage in a basement. The truth is I already

know your little boy, I’ve seen him in your shadows, and I’ve already grown to love him. You

also know my little girl, she has been living in our home throughout our entire relationship.

She has loved you as much as I have, and although at first she was afraid of you, she was

afraid that you would hurt her, she grew to love you, and she learned to trust you. When

you were gone for so long, she began to worry, she worried that perhaps you would never

come back, she worried that perhaps you didn’t want to come back to us, perhaps you

wanted another home, a different home, perhaps you had stopped loving us.

But I reassured her, and I told her about the love that we shared, the hours and days we

spent looking into each other’s eyes, as time stood still and the world around us vanished,

and we questioned, every day, how we could be so lucky. Our love is the truest love I’ve

ever known, our love is the deepest love I’ve ever known, and I know that a love like ours,

never just goes away.

One day my little girl will meet your little boy, and they will love each other as much as we

love each other, the four of us will build a home so whole, that all our fears will be replaced

by trust, our anger will be replaced by love, and tyranny will be nothing but a distant

memory.

This isn’t going to happen overnight, we don’t want you to exhaust yourself trying to come

home, we don’t want you to run and fall, we want you to make wise and calculated steps, so

that you can slowly but surely come back to us.

If I could, I would be in the basement with you, but you don’t want me there, and if I force

myself into the basement, my little girl will turn into a tyrant again and our home will

collapse. So although I’m not in the darkness with you, know that I can still see you, and I

am still here, holding our fort, waiting for you to find the strength to love your tyrant

unconditionally, so that you can bring him home for us to nurture and heal him, so that he

can learn to fearlessly trust both of us.",psst_shhh,3,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/fectqt/letter_from_my_girlfriend/,amp x200b girlfriend wrote letter agreed share amp x200b letter

Kids and depression/ Mental Illness,"I am desperate for advice on how to explain to my 11 year old son what depression is. I actually have bipolar disorder but don't even know where I'd start with that one. My son gets very angry with me. He thinks I choose to be/feel this way and says ""just stop being sad be happy how easy is that?!"" I know I cannot be upset with him for not understanding, but I'm also extremely frustrated about it. He says it's embarrassing to have a mom with depression. That just hurts me even more. 

He went from having a happy, energetic, spunky, fun, thrill seeking, supportive mom to one who lays in bed all the time, is constantly fatigued, has migraines constantly, no patience, never wants to do anything, cries a lot, etc. I feel like he's grieving me. I grieve myself, so I can understand. But he cannot. He thinks I'm just being selfish, lazy, mean, etc. 

I looked on Google for some ideas but didn't find anything that I felt like going with. I've tried many times to explain it from my perspective, but he just cannot comprehend what I'm saying.

It was one of the main ways I interacted with my friends as well. After that they decided that my phone was distracting me so it was confiscated as soon as I got home from school. Then they decided to take my door off the hinges to look in on me more. The worst part is i don't even know why they are doing all of this. My grades were good, A's and B's and in 6 AP classes while working 20 hours a week and maintaining a social life. Everything was going so good. Now I get home and feel empty and alone.

"I was told it gets better, 10 years later and it just got numb.","So first of all, I don't know if this is a rule or not, but I've never been to a doctor's and actually got confirmed to have depression, I have anxiety issues and likely agoraphobia, I haven't left the house for 4 years, even then it only lasted a month, since before that I hadn't left the house in 5 years. Even before that, I didn't receive a high school education as I spent it all, you guessed it, in my house.

There was a small portion in my life where I actually had friends, 10 years ago, I was active, ""fun"", enjoying my life fairly well but occasionally I was still in the dumps. Most of my friends seemed to be the same way so we talked about it a lot. Of course my friend at the time tried to encourage me, tell me it gets better and kept an eye on me to make sure I was coming out of my shell so to say.

So of course I fucked that up, I made a small mistake, said sorry, they forgave me and I punished myself by not allowing myself to see my friends. Still haven't seen them to this day, besides one, my so. Somehow, they have infinite patience and can put up with all my shit.

I punished myself a lot, I'd cut myself, I'd punch and slam myself, destroy my own possessions. My so tried their best and it sort of fizzled out. These days I don't get the will to do so anymore.

Ever since then, nothing, for a whole 10 years, most of it I didn't even spend time with my mother and younger sister. Maybe I was still punishing myself. I had few hobbies or even things to do, though I didn't fully enjoy any of it, I was starting to feel pretty emotionless.
Towards the end I actually started reconnecting with my mother and finally learning stuff and just starting to connect with my sister.

It was going fairly well for me, I was starting to look at the bright side, I still never left my house but it was starting to feel comfortable instead of a prison.

But then my sister did something unspeakable, something I don't think I could ever forgive, but my mother did, instantly. I was hurt, angry and it pulled me straight back. Ever since I've been weird around my sister, finding it almost impossible to connect and angry at my mother.

So now, I just feel numb, I really don't know what to do, I've been trying to forgive and forget but it's impossible. I've been trying to go outside but I almost have panic attacks just thinking about it sometimes. I'm back to the prison with nothing to do but wait.

Why do I still have a feeling like I’m doing everything wrong?,"These are just random things because I guess I need a hug. 


I’ve been feeling so lonely lately. I can’t do even basic stuff, like I need to motivate myself to take a shower or find reasons to eat something. I’m finally taking some medication. I still struggle with finding a job, but it’s okay I guess, kinda regret wasting all my money and not saving more. That’s like a coping mechanism. I starve myself and then feel sick again. I can’t motivate myself to workout because I don’t have any limits and I either don’t do anything or workout till I’m exhausted. I either cry a lot because of everything or feel nothing at all. I have like two friends now and my boyfriend. I appreciate them the most. But I really hate myself for not being able to have phone calls with my boyfriend(we’re in a long distance rn). I really love him and I want to change it but I can’t make myself do that?? Like he knows about my issues and he’s very patient and supportive but I have a feeling like I’m bothering him al the tome and making him feel sad because calling someone you love is like the very basic thing that can make you feel closer to each other. But that’s not the point of my post, I have no idea if it even makes sense. 



I’m so tired, I’m not feeling broken, I’m not having desire to end my life because I know that it’s just temporary and I’ll be fine. But I’m feeling extremely not motivated at all, I’m sad and I hate myself for not being productive. I’m afraid to lose my boyfriend or my friends and I hate being that annoying person who always asks “you don’t regret our relationship”. I’m tired and I have no idea what to do. I’ve been feeling so sad lately and very stressed and I can’t sleep and I have headaches all the time. I just want to cry and to get a hug maybe.

May take college medical withdrawal but I'll be broke? Long read,"I'm at a cross roads. Yesterday, I had a mid term and showed up 50 minutes late. I had actually gotten up that morning to go and take it (my mom took the car extra early and came back late even though I told her that I needed to be at school). Unfortunately this didnt help the fact that I havent been attending school or doing the hwks and labs. My programming professor understood and gave me the slip to go back to do the labs and hwks that I missed. Though again, yesterday I was told that I'm approaching the deadline for this consideration very close and was suggested to take a medical withdrawal by my professor. This year just isnt my year. I feel withdrawn from everything and just cant bring myself to hold onto the shread of stability. Me missing my classes is also something I told my therapist and psychiatrist about. 

My professor wants to hold a meeting with me and my academic advisor to see if there is a way to avoid medical withdrawal and catch up on assignments. I appreciated the consideration until early today, when I realized that I most likely wont be attending lab today either. I cant keep doing this. This is the second time I've taken this class and its gotten admittedly worse. The first time was alright but this time...is terrible. I dont have a support group like last time and I dont have a team. My first time, I was turning in assignments but the lack on my part was not studying for the midterm but I still had a long stride of actually passing then. I feel so uncomfortable in class, I feel like a foreigner.  I get sad because it's  as if I have no idea what's going on around me and it makes me so sad. 

I have a sibling who faced this problem when she tried attending college. She got depressed, started sleeping in and never leaving for school. I dont know why we cant stay in college and actually graduate but it seems like a curse. 


If I leave school, I'm faced with having to leave my school job. If I lose my school job, I wont have any funds. My mother will be leaving me in our hometown and I wont be able to get help from her like I need . I know that if i withdraw, i wont be able to withdraw from one class, I'd have to leave all of them. I didnt have the best if luck from finding work without school ties. So, I'm scared to leave school. I'm diagnosed with depression and GAD. I'd be anxiety ridden and depressed knowing that I'll be holding my grad year back and I wont be able to conjure up funds. 

I wanted to love school. I know I can love learning but I cant seem to love that or anything else right now. I was supposed to be graduating this year but I souldnt be anyway due to needing more classes to complete. I had planned on passing this semester and taking up extra summer classes go shorten time but ...that's all gone. 

I dont know what to do. Should I schedule this meeting in hope of finding options where I dont withdraw and end up pissing away at the possible opportunities? Or just withdrawal, be possibly homeless and come back to school when I'm better? Its hard making a living without a college degree and im worried. I want to stop the self sabotage of depression  but it's as if I can't.


I don't want to leave my home. I want to stay home all the time . I told my counselor this and it's as if she doesnt really get it. She makes it seem as if it's an easy fix and then I wont do it again. I hate the therapists I've had because they are very ineffective. I had one who turned out to be a child psychiatrist and she was a thousand times better but for some reason I cant see her in our facility any longer.",ErrorMyUser,1,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/feeojq/may_take_college_medical_withdrawal_but_ill_be/,cross road yesterday mid term showed 50 minute late actually gotten morning go take mom took car extra early came back late even though told needed school unfortunately didnt help fact havent attending school hwks lab programming professor understood gave slip go back lab hwks missed though yesterday wa told approaching deadline consideration close wa suggested take medical withdrawal professor year isnt year feel withdrawn everything cant bring hold onto shread stability missing class also something told therapist psychiatrist professor want hold meeting academic advisor see way avoid medical withdrawal catch assignment appreciated consideration early today realized likely wont attending lab today either cant keep second time taken class gotten admittedly worse first time wa alright time terrible dont support group like last time dont team first time wa turning assignment lack part wa studying midterm still long stride actually passing feel uncomfortable class feel like foreigner get sad idea going around make sad sibling faced problem tried attending college got depressed started sleeping never leaving school dont know cant stay college actually graduate seems like curse leave school faced leave school job lose school job wont fund mother leaving hometown wont able get help like need know withdraw wont able withdraw one class leave didnt best luck finding work without school tie scared leave school diagnosed depression gad anxiety ridden depressed knowing holding grad year back wont able conjure fund wanted love school know love learning cant seem love anything else right wa supposed graduating year souldnt anyway due needing class complete planned passing semester taking extra summer class go shorten time gone dont know schedule meeting hope finding option dont withdraw end pissing away possible opportunity withdrawal possibly homeless come back school better hard making living without college degree im worried want stop self sabotage depression want leave home want stay home time told counselor doesnt really get make seem easy fix wont hate therapist ineffective one turned child psychiatrist wa thousand time better reason cant see facility longer,may take college medical withdrawal broke long read,error user,3591,64,error user cross road yesterday mid term showed 50 minute late actually gotten morning go take mom took car extra early came back late even though told needed school unfortunately didnt help fact havent attending school hwks lab programming professor understood gave slip go back lab hwks missed though yesterday wa told approaching deadline consideration close wa suggested take medical withdrawal professor year isnt year feel withdrawn everything cant bring hold onto shread stability missing class also something told therapist psychiatrist professor want hold meeting academic advisor see way avoid medical withdrawal catch assignment appreciated consideration early today realized likely wont attending lab today either cant keep second time taken class gotten admittedly worse first time wa alright time terrible dont support group like last time dont team first time wa turning assignment lack part wa studying midterm still long stride actually passing feel uncomfortable class feel like foreigner get sad idea going around make sad sibling faced problem tried attending college got depressed started sleeping never leaving school dont know cant stay college actually graduate seems like curse leave school faced leave school job lose school job wont fund mother leaving hometown wont able get help like need know withdraw wont able withdraw one class leave didnt best luck finding work without school tie scared leave school diagnosed depression gad anxiety ridden depressed knowing holding grad year back wont able conjure fund wanted love school know love learning cant seem love anything else right wa supposed graduating year souldnt anyway due needing class complete planned passing semester taking extra summer class go shorten time gone dont know schedule meeting hope finding option dont withdraw end pissing away possible opportunity withdrawal possibly homeless come back school better hard making living without college degree im worried want stop self sabotage depression want leave home want stay home time told counselor doesnt really get make seem easy fix wont hate therapist ineffective one turned child psychiatrist wa thousand time better reason cant see facility longer may take college medical withdrawal broke long read

Passively suicidal,"So I think about death all the time and regularly think about situations where I get hit by like a bus or have terminal cancer, it's so bizarre. Because I'm not actually a risk to myself,  I'm not in any way planning any attempt but as I fall asleep it seems like I'm always thinking about how an exit wound would look at the back of my head.  


I call passive suicidality 'living in the Grey'. It's an inbetween state,  smack bang in the middle of loving life and hating it.  It's so strange because health professionals are always asking if I'm having 'dark thoughts' and it's like,  well,  what really *is* a dark thought? When it comes down to it,  it's the behaviour, the intention, not the thoughts,  that are the true issue.  

Death is always on my mind.  Not just my own,  but anyone and everyone.  I think constantly about different situations where people in my life die tragically,  and how I would grieve.  Would I crumple into a depressed mess or rise to the occasion and be strong for the rest of my family?  Who would care if I died?  So many questions all the time.

They know the crushing, suicidal feeling it is if you're ever told that you can't pass, and they simply don't want me to get pushed over the edge and end it, they're only being nice. 

Haven't gotten a job, haven't even gotten a license, and haven't done anything school related much either. I just sit on my ass and play video games, watch youtube, anime, listen to music, I just do my hobbies, I think about getting off my ass and getting my life back on track but the lack of motivation I have is weighing me down like an anvil tied to my ankles. I just feel no need to...

I'm a joke, and one with a mediocre punchline too. Somebody respectable would have done SOMETHING by now, I've been emotionally abused by my stepfather for a few years but I got over it, so I really can't use that reason or excuse. I could have had a job, had a license and be in college right now, but I can't. Because I lack any motivation, because I don't want my license to say ""male"" or my dead name, because I don't want to be discriminated or humiliated at any public workplaces for being trans, maybe if I wasn't such a lazy pussy, I could have gotten somewhere. 

But nah, I haven't, and it's all because of laziness, lack of motivation, and fear. 6 months to recover? Fair enough, a year? Maybe if it's that serious, but 2 years? Sigh... If there is one word anyone can describe me as, it would be; a failure.

Nearly a year into my gender transition: What I've learned. MtF,"I thought I escaped the depression. From the first dose of my Spiro and Estrogen I felt a huge weight off of my shoulders. It was time to be myself and thrive. I enjoyed it. I no longer needed to hide. After a couple of months I thought I'd try dating. Of course, I expected the hate messages. I expected the slurs. What I never expected was the amount of men that maintained interest after I disclosed that I'm transgender. What I soon found was a pattern. A pattern I could not escape. It was in this moment I realized what being a living fetish is like. 

For the past nine months I've been nothing more to men than a source for pictures and a discreet fun time. I still fall for the player saying he wants something more than hooking up just to be used, ghosted, and hit up when he is drunk and horny. The first few times hurt my ego but I recovered. Having the same story for nine months straight makes me question if this is all that life has for me. 

I want nothing more than to just connect with someone. Talk with a guy about life and get to know each other. But. The only attention I ever get are if I post naughty pics or nudes. Once I show and indication that I'm human they ghost. I've made a few trans friends and the story is the same. Doesn't matter how pretty. How much they pass. We're just a fetish and nothing more. It makes sense why they're all either depressed or escorts. 

I've fought the desire to end it completely so I no longer have to deal with the loneliness. It's a crippling loneliness.

I did something I wish I didn’t [Trigger Warning] [self harm],"I bought a bottle of wine on my way home from work lastnight. Drinking alone is never good for me but I felt like I really needed to drink. Anyway 2 glasses in I’m trying to find somebody to hang out with, texting all my friends that are nearby and everyone was busy. I felt so lonely, painfully lonely, and I started hating on myself. I’ve learned to really love myself the past few years but lastnight my dark side emerged and I wanted to hurt myself. I took a knife to my leg and just started cutting, something I haven’t done since high school. When I was finished I just looked at it and knew it was a mistake, now I’m going to have to hide it till it heals. No sex, no beach/pool trips, no shorts (the weather is always warm where I live so even though it’s winter these things are still an option for me) ...

my mom just gave up on me,"Since I was young, my mom was the only person who took care of me because my dad left when I was a baby. However, during the summer before freshman year, my parents agreed to move in together and share an apartment so that I could have both of my parents. My dad made a clear that he changed for the better and he wasn't gonna be a deadbeat anymore. This arrangement only lasted for about a year and a half, however, because my dad recently moved out two weeks ago.

My dad leaving again hurt a lot because I felt like I didn't build enough of a relationship with him. I never really got to the point where I could tell him personal stuff, especially how I feel about him and his decision to leave again. It's just been adding on stress and anxiety.

Yesterday, the straw that broke the camels back erupted at school, and I ended up in a violent altercation with another student. I pushed him into the wall, and his head started to bleed. A lot. I immediately went to apologize, and he said there was no hard feelings.

I was suspended for five days, and my mom was furious after she found out. Over the last two days, she's been repeatedly telling me that she's given up on me and my dreams. She says the only place I'll ever end up is prison, and I'll never be shit. So now she's giving me to my dad because she just can't handle me anymore and all I do is make her suffer.",NinjaSnadger360,0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/fef07m/my_mom_just_gave_up_on_me/,since wa young mom wa person took care dad left wa baby however summer freshman year parent agreed move together share apartment could parent dad made clear changed better gonna deadbeat anymore arrangement lasted year half however dad recently moved two week ago dad leaving hurt lot felt like build enough relationship never really got point could tell personal stuff especially feel decision leave adding stress anxiety yesterday straw broke camel back erupted school ended violent altercation another student pushed wall head started bleed lot immediately went apologize said wa hard feeling wa suspended five day mom wa furious found last two day repeatedly telling given dream say place ever end prison never shit giving dad handle anymore make suffer,mom gave,ninja nad ger 360,1375,25,ninja nad ger 360 since wa young mom wa person took care dad left wa baby however summer freshman year parent agreed move together share apartment could parent dad made clear changed better gonna deadbeat anymore arrangement lasted year half however dad recently moved two week ago dad leaving hurt lot felt like build enough relationship never really got point could tell personal stuff especially feel decision leave adding stress anxiety yesterday straw broke camel back erupted school ended violent altercation another student pushed wall head started bleed lot immediately went apologize said wa hard feeling wa suspended five day mom wa furious found last two day repeatedly telling given dream say place ever end prison never shit giving dad handle anymore make suffer mom gave

goodnight,"I want to live. I'm a little, cheerful girl. I love music. Whenever I'm about to go to sleep, I take my pink mp3 player to my bed and listen to my favorite songs for hours while imagining myself as a skydiver, princess or a superhero! As I dive into the blue sky I scream so loud that my throat hurts. Maybe if I'm loud enough I won't be able to hear my mother's epileptic seizure as the nice paramedic asks me what I've been reading and if school is going good. I try to ignore my grandma crying while my grandfather just looks away from what is happening. School is going good, I'm really enjoying my art classes. The teacher says that I have some potential and that I'm a pleasure to have in class. Maybe because I rarely talk. I like when my teacher praises me, it makes me feel like I'm special - I think as I sit on my bed, with one of my CDs playing in the background.

I'm in middle school. I live in the city now. My school is bigger, more modern and it even has a cafeteria. It's always crowded yet somehow empty at the same time. I no longer have art classes. My teachers say that I'm smart but kind of lazy. All of the girls are so pretty. My cheeks are chubbier than theirs, my legs are thicker and my belly is sticking out. I skip my lunch. Looking at pictures of gorgeous and thin girls on the internet makes me feel full. I hate PE classes. I'm the only girl that can't play volleyball. I hit the ball really hard and now my hoodie is stained red. It hurts but I pretend nothing has happened. Nobody notices. 

High school is scary. Boys don't really like me. Maybe because of the way I dress or because I cut my hair very short. Starving becomes binging. I really hate my thighs. I'm the class clown. I skip school every day for a week. I overdose on medication several times. One time I almost fall down the stairs and pass out in my bathtub after overdosing on some pills. I try to kill myself. When in the ER one of my teachers is there. She looks at me. I can barely stay awake. One of the nurses tells me that I'm selfish. After coming back from hospital my teachers say that I'm the laziest student they've ever had. My mother forces me to lie so they won't put me in a psychiatric facility. I go to the psychiatrist once and never go back. Now my grandma sleeps in my room and they look through my stuff every day. I have to ask to go to the bathroom. My mom makes me stay in the guest room with only a bed, a desk and my textbooks. Dinner tastes awful. I want to die. 

College starts. My major is not that great. I have literature classes. I'm a very average student. Sometimes I remember my elementary school art teacher. I feel like I failed her. Boys still don't like me. My cheeks are still way too chubby. My body is covered in white thick lines. People stare a lot. Some ask questions some just avoid me. I still imagine and fantasize before going to sleep a lot. Skydiving turned into jumping off a bridge into a river, grand parties and colorful dresses turned into lonely college dorms, oversized t-shirts, and old sweaters, I no longer am a superhero, now I'm the one waiting for someone or something to save me. I no longer scream, I no longer put up a fight. I remember loving music but now it just gives me a headache. I'm an almost 21-year-old, tired woman. I no longer want to live.

She has talked to me frequently but it just seems that she doesn't care. One of my friends who I thought was my friend leaked out that I'm autistic and have ADHD as well as I take medications for that every day. Now, whenever I walk around school people look at me and laugh while talking shit about me. Some have called me a freak and leave the school and go to a mental asylum. I've been called a mistake so many times. All this has been affecting me emotionally and physically. This has been making my depression worse and has increased my levels of anxiety. I've been having more anxiety attacks since this all started. Everything around me is starting to become meaningless to me. Nothing other than my mom, my dog, and my little brother give me a genuine source of happiness. The people at my school have made me feel even more worthless than I was before this. I want to feel accepted by someone other than my family. (I consider my friends family as well) People who don't talk shit about me or don't look at me strangely just disregard I'm there.

choosing not to see you this time,"
It hurts..but I remembered the feelings I had last time I went and saw you. It hurt..I cried myself to sleep. I went to bed hurting and I woke up hurting. Once again I’m left looking dumb to go out of my way to see you. I crossed many busy roads and climbed many tall mountains to just try and please you and I still believe you truly don’t care. It’s hard letting go of the one person that once made you the happiest you had ever been in life. Looking back at when I had you I looked so different. I literally had a glow within me. You gave me that glow that made me shine so bright..you also took it away without any hesitation. I’ve never been the same since then. I’m not sure why I’ve kept you around for 2 more years after we broke up. I know deep down you will never be able to make me shine like you used to..I will never have that glow again. I will never be able to feel that love again..and it simple as to why not..because you don’t love me..you don’t care about me..It’s funny how life works. How the people you would do anything for in this world will do nothing for you. How the ones that once made you so happy now bring darkness into your life. When will one day someone fight for me..fight to keep me seeing me glow...fight to keep me happy..Hopefully soon..but for now as I wait I’ve decided to not cross any busy roads for you or climb any mountains..for now I will stay here even though it hurts I’m safer here by myself than with you.",princessmaeha199920,0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/fegd3g/choosing_not_to_see_you_this_time/,hurt remembered feeling last time went saw hurt cried sleep went bed hurting woke hurting left looking dumb go way see crossed many busy road climbed many tall mountain try please still believe truly care hard letting go one person made happiest ever life looking back looked different literally glow within gave glow made shine bright also took away without hesitation never since sure kept around 2 year broke know deep never able make shine like used never glow never able feel love simple love care funny life work people would anything world nothing one made happy bring darkness life one day someone fight fight keep seeing glow fight keep happy hopefully soon wait decided cross busy road climb mountain stay even though hurt safer,choosing see time,princess mae ha 199920,1457,33,princess mae ha 199920 hurt remembered feeling last time went saw hurt cried sleep went bed hurting woke hurting left looking dumb go way see crossed many busy road climbed many tall mountain try please still believe truly care hard letting go one person made happiest ever life looking back looked different literally glow within gave glow made shine bright also took away without hesitation never since sure kept around 2 year broke know deep never able make shine like used never glow never able feel love simple love care funny life work people would anything world nothing one made happy bring darkness life one day someone fight fight keep seeing glow fight keep happy hopefully soon wait decided cross busy road climb mountain stay even though hurt safer choosing see time

I have already planned my way out properly - on 17th March, using 20 grams of Potassium Cyanide mixed with water, I need of course to find a place as far away from the crowd (i.e forest or something) then I’m just going to lay down there and finally be at peace. I’m hoping it wouldn’t be so painful. I have done research that correct dose of this poison will give you a clean death in a matter of seconds. 

Funny thing is, I don’t actually want to die. I love life. The smell of rain, the beauty of music, the taste of sugar, life is such a wonderful thing. But I just can’t take it anymore. My life is extremely difficult. I am just totally giving up. It’s just too much for me to stay alive. Thought I share my story here for those of you who are still fighting. I hope you guys aren’t as weak as I am and I hope someday you will find the light and get out of this darkness.

Im tired of people thinking depression is just something you can get over within a short period of time.,"Talked to my mom today about a test I have today that I was stressing over. And the conversation turned into me wasting my potential (all in love). But what pisses me off is this just ""get over it"" mentality like what's taking me so long. And her and I both know I have to get on top of things but when you had depression for 8 years and counting this is not something you just overcome in a short period of time.

And probably what pisses me off the most is the fact she's right bc her and I both know time doesn't wait for anyone. I don't have the luxury to keep performing at the level I'm currently am.

All of this is just frustrating, ik the answer it's just a matter of applying myself.",Conflicting_Thoughts,2,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/feg4qe/im_tired_of_people_thinking_depression_is_just/,talked mom today test today wa stressing conversation turned wasting potential love piss get mentality like taking long know get top thing depression 8 year counting something overcome short period time probably piss fact right bc know time wait anyone luxury keep performing level currently frustrating ik answer matter applying,im tired people thinking depression something get within short period time,conflicting thought,693,104,conflicting thought talked mom today test today wa stressing conversation turned wasting potential love piss get mentality like taking long know get top thing depression 8 year counting something overcome short period time probably piss fact right bc know time wait anyone luxury keep performing level currently frustrating ik answer matter applying im tired people thinking depression something get within short period time

"Trapped with my own monsters, until it's over","I feel so worthless for so many years now.

but the past week I feel nothing else than  desperate, pain, sadness and emptiness. 

I've realized there is no one that would be there for me, never. 

I have vacations now for a month. After the first day I felt like nothing. I'm just something. Maybe a part of the nature. I mean I do nothing the entire day nothing at all because nothing helps. Everything is just boring and I don't feel anything. I have no one to rely on, every time when I start to make a friendship the people just leave me after spending too much time with me, I mean when they start to know me a little bit everyone left me. Or they use me. I'm getting sick of everything. 

People say things will get better, I'm happy that this is true for some people but it's not for everyone. I just feel like a shadow that no one ever notices. 

I changing my current state or emotions rapidly. Like the last time I played VRChat (a pc game for the VR, where you can wander around worlds meet other people and so on) I had fun but after one second it despaired and I was mad like hell for no reason. 

I feel like their are more minds inside my own mind. other kind of personalitys. 

I just want to end it all but I'm too weak to do it by myself, I see no exit out of this emptiness it got closed. I just hope everyday to die and to forget everything. Or to stop everything for a few years to take a break and get my shit together, but it's just too late. 

I don't even have a family that I could spend my time with, Not even a friend anymore, Not even anyone. Everything is just overwhelming and too much even there is nothing. I can't even cry.

"I tried to kill myself yesterday and wanna quit the meds, long post","So i was at a party and got drunk, not i cant walk drunk, but drunk enough to make my metabolism fast enough to get rid of all the meds in my blood i guess. I just finished high school and at this party were all my classmates and the people i once called friends. 
I thought i could go there and talk to them and try to befriend them again. I miss them so much. Ive always been very shy and i thought i would drink because that makes me all bubbly and stuff, but this time it just did not work, i went right past the bubbly and the very drunk and a mess straight to i feel like i wanna die. This had never happened to me before.
So there i was, kinda off my meds and feeling depressed and there was a pool so in a place no one would notice too fast i started getting in slowly. Then i just jumped. I tried to do it but my body wouldnt all i wanted to do was sink to the bottom and numb everything out and then justgo i guess? But my body wouldnt, i couldnt physically do it.
My parents came and 4 people tried to help. Only one of which i would have expected and its not like i didnt like them i just didnt think they liked me, definatly not enough to help and im sure they will dissapear now, except for the one, but he cant take care of me like i need it. I need someone to be there all the time and i guess thats not fair.
I guess thats not fair, because thats how i lost my friends. They didnt understand i needed someone to be there and i tried to open up but i also need checkups, because i will convince myself im just bothering. 
I wanted one of my friends to help me the most, the one id known the longest, the one i had always been able to come back to, but i didnt get that she just didnt have the time or the will to help me like i needed anymore.
Now i dont wanna take the meds because i truly thought i was better. Turns out i was just drugged all the time and it feels so fake now. I thought i was happy and out of it and that soon enough my doctor would take me off them slowly. That i was starting to understand how not to be depressed, but now i think the only way to do that is to feel it and fight it, not take drugs and make it ""disappear"".

forcing myself to appreciate my progress,"Hi! I've been battling depression for the past two years, officially diagnosed in summer 2019, currently on medication &amp; therapy. Beating myself up every. single. day. for just being ""lazy"", and ""not being able to get it together"", as well as struggling with the thought that i somehow just tricked everybody (including the doctors) into thinking that i have depression when really i dont. 🥴  
Anyways, after another horrifying therapy session of me complaining that i am really just a piece of shit that only wants to sleep 24/7, wasting her life away not accomplishing anything, my therapist urged me to list all the things which i do DO and sort of look at them from afar and try to practice gratitude and appreciation. Here it is:

1) most days, I am able to make myself brush my teeth and on the good days even take a shower  
2) i could have given up on all work  to kind of ""sleep through"" my depression (my partner can support me financially with no trouble) however as tempting as it is I still do the work (working remotely from home) and recently took on a big project, which I was debating declining but still didn't (no idea how and if  im going to handle it but ill update you on here)  
3) roughly once a week I may feel like putting on makeup and doing my nails  
4) i am able to socialize with my best friend and truly enjoy our evenings together, which is a huge one  
5) i am now able to recognise that the meds do really help and I stopped having hysterical breakdowns and intrusive, disturbing thoughts  
6) i have never missed a day of therapy  
7) even though my sleep schedule is non-existence (sleeping every 4 hours during the course of a day) I still pull myself out of bed, have breakfast, maybe out on some clothes and go out to work in a cafe, even if for just an hour

I think that's about it. I do feel better.

My parents always thought I was lazy,"as the title states my parents always thought I was lazy in my highschool days, but I was just unbelievably depressed. Can anyone else relate? 

was I lazy at times? Hell yea brother but isn’t everyone at some point? They’d call me lazy if I hung out in my bedroom, didn’t shower, ect went on for all my highschool days even when I was on a football team my whole highschool life never came home till 6 and was gone Friday/Saturday nights out with friends, cleaned up as much as a teenager does. 

My point being why didn’t my parents ever sit me down and talk to me and explain it? I remember having tears coming down my face as 14 year old me held a knife in the kitchen as my step dad walked towards the laundry room I had a sigh of relief that someone would help but he didn’t mention it or see me or talk to me. I feel like if they would’ve just sat me down after seeing these signs they’d know and I’d be way better developed then I am now cause I’m just learning these things now. I had no idea it was even depression I thought something was wrong with me, still do till this day. They determined I was the quiet one and didn’t like to talk much but up until highschool I never had that problem, I felt like I got sunk into a depression and never really came out of it and now I’m stuck being profiled as this guy I’m not, even when I speak I get spoken over like it’s a primal thing or them trying to shun my words? 

I don’t want people to think my parents where bad they were great but I just don’t understand it at all. For me when I have kids I’d make sure to see the quiet signs

I'm a mess right now,"I have no one to listen to my problems so I thought I would write them down. Then I decided to post it on here. 

Just moved to a new city and started at a new school. I don't miss anything from my old hometown, I'm actually quite happy to be somewhere else. Moving has been tough though. I had to give up my cat and say goodbye to my friends.

I have kind of 'joined' a group of friends at school. They're all pretty nice. The dynamic of the group is a little weird though. Its like 50% introverts who don't talk much, myself included, and 50% strongly opinionated extroverts. They mostly seem like a nice group of people though. In regard to making friends, things have gone pretty well. Trying to form deep relationships with people is a hard and long process though. It's hard not to get impatient and blame myself though. I feel like I'm being ungrateful because even though I think I've been lucky in finding a group of friends, which is exactly what I want, I still feel so shit.

I've never been diagnosed but I think I could have depression and/or anxiety. I would love to get some medication if it would ease the pain, but I don't want to tell my parents how I feel.

Over the past few years I've thought of suicide probably at least once a month, usually weekly or daily though, and planned it two or three times in my life. I've been thinking about it a lot recently. I've been researching pills I can get at a chemist that I could overdose on and I've found a suicide bridge that's very close to my house. I've been told that I should live for all the good moments in life, but the effort it takes to reach those moments doesn't seem worth it sometimes.

I'm starting to find it hard to trust myself. I'm like a different person from day to day, or even hour to hour. During the brief moments when I feel happy about something I worry about my emotions causing me to do something I regret. When I'm sad or empty it's all I can think about.

There's this girl who's not in my new social circle but who has been really nice to me. She seems like a really nice person. We don't see each other much but she always makes an effort to greet me. I'm unsure whether her intentions are romantic or platonic and it's making me dizzy. I really want us to become better friends or maybe more, but I am not great at social interaction and always make myself feel shit about every little mistake I make. I feel kind of like It'll never happen, yet I spent the whole afternoon texting her. I feel like I'm going insane.

The people I admire most are the ones that seem like the nicest people you could ever know and make you feel happy just being present or after a short conversation and you're always left wanting more from them. I aspire to be like this and make other people happy. I need to remember to smile more though.

Usually I have a high libido but the past two weeks my drive has literally been non-existent. A month ago my shit suddenly became sloppy even though my diet is quite healthy and hasn't changed much, I think it is anxiety causing me to be extremely tense all the time. I just started waking up at 4am every morning out of nowhere and I can't stop. I don't know what the fuck is happening to me.

Missing the sadness,"I suffered with depression for many years, and haven recently reached a turning point in my life where I finally feel good again, but somethings a little off, all my emotions are less extreme, sadness passes in minutes now and is nowhere near the intensity is was before, but I feel this weird longing to feel an emotion to that same depth and extreme again, has anyone else experienced this? Or am I going mad?
It’s like I was so used to the emotion everything else feels uncomfortable now.

I feel so stupid for feeling like this, I’m lucky enough to (it appears so far) gotten past the darkness that defined my teens and early adulthood, and I have this sick lust to feel it again?

It also come with this constant creeping fear that this ‘ok’ness I’m feeling now is a facade, that soon something will happen and I will fall back into my old state instantly.

The conflict of this fear and the longing is driving me a little mad.
I can’t talk to anyone I know about it because I’m pretty sure I’m gonna sound insane, so I guess I’m asking you guys.

Complete dissatisfied human being.,"So I‘m a bit excited about writing a post about it. I‘m struggling from severe depression since I‘m 11. I‘m also not the one who‘s crying over things happened in the past. It’s about my condition I‘ve been living with the last years and want some advices about how to finally be able to handle it.

Everyday I wake up with great dissatisfaction. Always in a bad mood. No motivation at all. Always tired and sleepy and feeling totally lost. I‘ve lost interest in nearly everything - drawing, music, singing... Not knowing what to do, I fear the future ahead of me. I was once totally into Design... thought this is what I‘m going to do. However, I‘ve also lost the interest in it. It was a gradual change and I can’t even explain why it happened since I was always passionate about it. 

Now I‘m sitting there - day by day - everything is annoying, not interesting anymore, not worth it and stressful to me. I feel like I fell into an Abyss with my head full of negative thoughts. I don’t know who I am neither am I satisfied with how the situation isn’t changing. I tried meditation once. It was a good experience. But I‘m not even in the mood to continue what might help me out of this situation. The only thing I’m currently doing is just playing games the whole day so I won’t be confronted with all those bad thoughts flooding my mind.

Don’t get me wrong. I’m really grateful for what I have. Being able to sleep on a bed, having enough food and embracing the small things in live. I don’t like it fancy. I just want to find happiness and being able to laugh again.

Hi,"Ive been really depressed lately... My math subject at school failed, i keep thinking i wont graduate, i have no energy to go to school anymore so i fake everything and go to a nearby computer cafe even though i only have enough money to commute to my school. I know lifes hard but theres something in my brain that broke... Im not crazy though just uncaring. But i noticed i suddenly grew an interest on one of our kitchen knives, not like to hurt people, its just an odd interest where you imagine the knife killing you painlessly.
But the thing is, i have a phobia of sharp things so i grew up cautious with sharp objects including knives... Its not really bad, i just do stabbing motions on myself, but the point is i consider doing that normal.
I also keep daydreaming while walking and oddly enough i daydream about me getting in a car crash or something similar, which i has a  high chance of happening considering im daydreaming. Another point is my fake laughter, i dont know why i keep doing it. I know im probably mentally ill but i have no why of knowing since psychiatrists and therapists costs very much in my country.

Medication works!!!,"I have been diagnosed with anxiety and depression right now and I have been taking prescription meds for the last couple weeks. It really helps! 

A little background- I got out of a 6 year relationship due to not seeing a future with my ex in December 2019. And then one person who I thought was really close friend of mine, decided he did not want to be friends with me anymore and cut all contacts with me. I get emotionally attached wayyy too easily and this led to me having anxiety, panic attacks and depression - which eventually led to insomnia, IBS, migraines and constant body aches. 

I started therapy in feb 2020 and have been since going to my therapist every week. And my therapist suggested I look at options for medication and try it. So since the last 2 weeks, I’m on Lexapro (SSRI) and my psychiatrist did tell me that it is going to take a few weeks to see changes. But for the last 3/4 days I have been observing that my energy levels have increased because I have been able to sleep well and it is so much better. My IBS has decreased and I haven’t got any migraines. I’m really really glad the medication is helping. If anyone is out there looking of options, and one the fence of trying medication, go for it.

Just need to vent.,"My depression has been at its worst recently and I’ve been trying desperately to find a therapist. The people I usually go through have told me it’s a 9 month waiting list and I honestly don’t think I’ll be able to wait that long so they suggested someone else. I checked their website and applied for therapy and managed to book an assessment appointment for next month. I slept easier last night at the thought that I’d be getting help soon only to wake up this morning to a notification on my phone saying they had cancelled my appointment as they no longer help people in my area. 

I’m just so sick of trying to help myself. I know it’s not their fault for not being able to help me, but just that brief feeling of hope meant so much to me. They shouldn’t allow people to apply if they aren’t going to be able to help or at least have a warning up. Everywhere I’ve looked so far has said to either wait, go to A&amp;E or call 111 IF it’s an emergency. What classifies as an emergency? Because I’m almost certain I wouldn’t be considered one and I don’t want to waste their time considering the NHS is already stretched thin. I’d pay for a therapist if I had the means but I can barely afford to feed myself right now.

"My life story, I am sorry it's so long","Hi there to all witches who take their craft seriously and really work, I am very deperate and on the brink of killing myself, there is so much to life; this I know. Unfortunately for me every door, every option, every opertunity has been closed off for me since I was born. 
Before I say what I came here to ask here's alittle backstory...

Backstory - throughout my mom's pregnancy the doctors were absolutely sure I was to be born a healthy baby girl, but somewhere along the line something unexpected happened and I came out not only a boy (according to what I've been told and what's written on my birth certificate) I was also unfortunate enough to be born with cleft lip, cleft palette, asthma, droopy eyes(don't know if that's the clinical term, but basically up until I was 8 or 10 [can't remember] I was unable to open my eyes all the way), and various other problems. I have always felt like I should not have been born a boy let alone live past 3 weeks (another failed diagnosis, lucky me right?). 

My childhood consisted of doing stuff to get attention but really all I wanted was to be liked a very hard thing to do when you are basically physically retarded and cannot talk like everyone else and constantly being reminded how you are such a failer that you couldn't even be born right. Since my conciousness first made its way into this world I have found myself thinking as a girl, along with thinking how much better litterally my life would have been if I managed to get it right. My dad was never in the picture so growing up without a father has been difficult on its own, but of course I was informed my dad had the chance to come to America when I was born because of my condition, but he declined to start a new family and I'm sure he had other reasons. My mom always worked all the time so it was pretty much me and my older brother for some time. An older brother that constantly made fun of me along with my mom for how I talked and how I acted. My brother constantly calling me gay, faggot, bitch, you name it he's done it. I'm sure he was unaware of how I felt inside but it traumatized me so much I am afraid of being myself. My body is not shaped how normal guy's are either so I have no idea how to take that problem. At school o was labeled the retarded kid no one liked.

Once I turned 11 my mom met a man, let's call him D. D was/is military and I later found out they got married quick (span of a few months) to finance my surgeries because I came from a background of poverty being single parent with 2 kids (later 3). I was always treated like a pet and always had the harshest and most frequent punishments. I was always forced to do everything for everybody else. My brother had to go do something like talk to a neighbor to get the bike fixed, I had to do it, stuff like that. To this day I get asked by family to buy their plane tickets or order them stuff cause they ""don't know how"". I have always been used all my life. I am nothing but a tool. As I patiently waited for the surgeries that I was supposed to get (atleast just the one to fix my nose and make me look somewhat normal) when I was 12, then delayed to 16, then 18, and finally at 19. I received the first surgery and all they did was make my life a living hell. 

Medical history - The doctor messed up my nose and now theres a glasses size gap on the bridge of my nose, for the tip of it they put cartalage from my side [which they lied to me and took it out of under my right chest] is fat which I didn't even care about having in the first place I just wanted my nose to be straight and deal with the rest later. I was put in a maxillary distractor (fancy name for cage on my head). To move my upper jaw forward so that they can reconstruct the palate (roof of my mouth) and straighten jaw or whatever they were doing I have no clue and it seemed unnessesary to me. It did however improve my speech just a tiny bit. I had to wear this crap o. My head for 4 months. Later I then made my own appointments 2 years later (22) and got a surgery for bonegraft. I am still missing the tooth implant which I cannot afford nor will I ever be able to, and I have to have another surgery on my nose again. I have always suffered from depression because of this but not only because of my unfortunate medical circumstances. (Also I have been getting pains around my abdominal area so either I've got something going on down there that shouldn't be or when I was born the doctors decided it be best to stick a penis on me and call me a boy).

As for the other reasons why I'm highly depressed and on the verge of collapsing. I was forced by my stepdad to go into debt. I wanted to go to college but I wanted to do it like everyone else, a real place surrounded by real people so I can maybe make atleast one friend and not be a total failer. Of course my luck hits home again and he forced me to go to an online college with the promiss of letting me use the money the army provides to him for school use. I agree and then he turns and days ""yea no... Do it yourself"". Landing me 16k debt that I can't pay, 3k I was forced to pay (just to get my diploma) and 3k my mom was forced to pay for me to be able to enroll in classes. Before this though I was planning to join the military to get a one up on life, but apparently not God's plan. Since when I brought up the idea he straight refused. I was not allowed to work or go out, I did not have an allowance or any type of money except money I got for my birthday ($20 every year, ages 18-19-20) and it didn't help that I had no friends up until senior year in highschool (that summer is the only happy memories I have after leaving my home town. He was very controlling that's why I feel I can't do anything without the constant reminder of all the trauma I've faced.

I did however keep the promis I made to myself about joining the military. Unfortunately though I was not let in. After two years of waiting and providing all of the medical paperwork I was finally sent to MEPS for the Marines, finally a chance for me to straighten out my life and man up and get all these rediculous thoughts and feelings out my head. NOPE! Once I get there I take the ASVAP and score on the higher side (I know right smarts actually came in handy I might look like a retard but my mental capacity is on the higher side) scored 80. Go through medical everything good up until the physical, the doctor asks me if I always been tall and skinny (I have a very feminine body besides the lack of breasts and having a penis) I say yes, normal ok cool then I go to the eye exam and they tell me I have astigmatism in my left eye (this I knew it happened when I was about 5 or so, started hallucinating and seeing giant spiders with extream detail) I went to see if I can get this fixed they said and I quote ""the damage to your eye is so savire that we do not have the equipment required to even make a dent of progress, the best solution I can offer is to use the effected eye and hope it gets better over time, sorry but there is nothing we can do for you at this time."" - Lasik doctor. So dream job at Marines = no go. The MEPS people tell me to try the army cause they accept pretty much anyone. I do and same thing they say I can't join because of my stupid eye, gee thanks God. 

At this point I start thinking maybe it's not meant to be and give up. 

My job history is halarious, atleast to me. Almost even didn't get hired. First job at age 20, McDonald's. Mom gets a house with my brother who got to live my fantasy of being in the military and travel the world, who then decides to mock me and make my life even worse by deciding he needs a surgery on his penis (he thought it was so curved he can't have sex yet he never tried, now he's depressed and thinks he can never have it and the doctor messed up, doctor also gave him circomsition) this happened during my attempt at joining the Marines. Throughout the course of 6 months he would constantly scream at the top of his lungs and say how God hates him, this is punishment, lash out at me for no reason, and make me feel not only unsafe but want to take my own life even more just to get out of that situation. Once we move into the new house this continues along with me every day for months on end calming him down explaining and telling him to be patient cause it's not gunna heal right away and healing of the body depends on the mind state anyways. Because of the move I am forced to quit my job that I actually enjoyed, to transfer to another McDonald's on the side of town we moved to (two towns down) I work there for 6 months before quitting because of how unfairly I was being treated, everything was my fault, I never did anything right, I was lazy, the works (even though I did mainly everybody's job in the kitchen, everyday I washed the grill swept mopped multiple times a day, I would be on grill then on the table making the burgers, I'd go and get the 50 pound boxes from the freezer. You name it I did it.) I eventually quit after 6 months bought a one way ticket to California and said my goodbyes to my brother who called my mom crying saying I left and he tried to stop me... I was sick of his shit. I had shit I was dealing with all my life and now I have to deal with you and your problem too, (excuse the langauge but) fuck outta here with that shit. 
I have so little control over my own life that I only spent 2 days in California before my mom told the entire family where I was and got my aunt (grandma's sister so technically grandma, who's also a nun) to somehow convince me to go to New York and stay with my uncle. I can't believe I actually fell for their stupid guilt trip but somehow after only 5 days I was off to NYC. I told myself it's probably best since there are lots of opportunities for me to be a musican. Wrong. I was basically plummited into the same exact situation with different people. Greedy money hungry aunt, no jobs, no money, an uncle who works at night sleeps durring the day, wierd daughter that turned into her mother. I had to get outta there it got to the point where she was looking through my stuff while I wasn't there to find proof I could pay her $700 to stay in the shitty, stinky room they kept rabbits in. With a door that locks from the outside and a broken window, very small room at that. After two months of looking for jobs while making music simaltaniously I am being called a liar I good for nothing a lazy bum you name it that's what she labeled me. I manage to get a job at McDonald's again but in NY. I manage to set up the bonegraft appointment and lay on an air mattress for two weeks feeling useless and being called useless. I go back to work and then move into my grandpa's room he was renting. Lucky for me he was on vacation for the next two months. Durring this time when my granpa came back j felt obligated and wanted to help with his bills ultimately giving him what little I had. 4 months pass and after much consideration and mom/brother begging for me to come back I oblige. 
I then get a job at another McDonald's in the next town over oppisate direction with the help of my old boss. I work there for 6 months before quitting because of the same drama the first time and hearing people continuously talking shit about me making me feel terrible about myself even more and with the emense parinoia I was experiencing due to smoking too much (the parinoia was about how I hid the fact I'm not normal and that I wish to be a girl and intricate details of my life).

If you think that's it well your wrong... My aunt comes to the USA on a visa and is put in a shit situation feeling unsafe, according to her. My mom is the only one in the USA she knows, mom folds and buys her a plane ticket to stay here for the time being, money my mom didn't have, which is fine desperate times desperate measures and such. She stays here for an entire month and quickly realises there is nothing here, everything is far and you have to drive everywhere. The time that she was here I could have used to work on my music the 3 hours I was left alone in the house, but no. 
Everything that she bought or well made me buy she complains and says it's for someone else, complains she didn't buy anything for herself and how she had to use my mom's clothes cause instead of buy things for herself she bought for everyone else supposedly. She then says how she needs a phone and makes me go find one for her. After I go through the trouble of finding and iPhone 7 plus for a crazy deal ($150) which they usually go for 300-350 I go and I borrow money to go get her the phone. She then says oh... I wanted a more modern one....like yours.... I'm like ugh ok I reset mine give her it and she then says she will give me the 150 (my phone was iPhone X pristine condition). Months pass I still don't have a job (stopped looking to focus on getting my licence), everybody keeps making excuses not to teach me, and the piece of crap car that my brother was going to pass down to me needs a new battery so I can't use it, and he also decided to retract the offer before I got the chance to use it and is selling it because he doesn't want to pay for it. He is not rich but wealthy $40k in the bank meanwhile I'm 30k in debt 12 of which collectors are being sent now. 

Debt - borrowed money I didn't have to help pay bills to not be called worthless and useless. Borrowed too much then took 5k out and ran away to California

That brings me to the present day, some details have been left out as to not make this extreamly long.
(Side note: I have always liked girls but it's more like an admiration/envy type of thing, always wishing I was one cause I always felt just wrong in my own body)

I just want to go home,"28F. My husband wanted to move from West coast to the East coast. Here we are 5 months later. I hate my job and most coworkers. I met a coworker I loved but she ended up leaving and now I have nothing to look forward to at work. I eat in my car I'd rather eat by myself than with gossiping, whining women.

My husband has always been a people person so hes made friends pretty quick. There's days were hes out and I'm sitting home alone.   

So alone. I cry in secret. I keep things to myself idk where I've gotten the idea that I need to be strong and crying is weakness.

I tried talking to my husband last  night and I was having a hard time talking. He ended up leaving and just sleeping in the livingroom which didnt help this situation. 

I miss my mom
I miss my sister
I really fuckin miss my friends. God do I miss thier hugs so damn much

I can't see myself past 25. I am now 25.,"For the longest time, I couldn't see myself living past 25. This mostly came about towards the last year of University and got worse around the end of 2017, when I wasn't landing work. 

In 2018, I met someone and suddenly I felt alive again. I felt calm and collected. Although I was stuck in the same loop of applying for work, it didn't feel as tiresome. In 2019, I got accepted into medicine and moved overseas. My partner starts tearing us apart 3 weeks into my move... I drop out of med school because the stresses from the break up became way too much to handle. Especially since I was overseas.

Now I am back to applying for jobs in my old degree and getting nowhere. I am heavily depressed. I can't see myself past 25 again. I have this strong feeling I will die this year. 

Atm, I welcome death with open hands... I am tired of life constantly shifting on me. :'(",Iamoriginalthrowaw4y,3,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/feebpw/i_cant_see_myself_past_25_i_am_now_25/,longest time see living past 25 mostly came towards last year university got worse around end 2017 landing work 2018 met someone suddenly felt alive felt calm collected although wa stuck loop applying work feel tiresome 2019 got accepted medicine moved overseas partner start tearing u apart 3 week move drop med school stress break became way much handle especially since wa overseas back applying job old degree getting nowhere heavily depressed see past 25 strong feeling die year atm welcome death open hand tired life constantly shifting,see past 25 25,iam original throw aw 4,875,40,iam original throw aw 4 longest time see living past 25 mostly came towards last year university got worse around end 2017 landing work 2018 met someone suddenly felt alive felt calm collected although wa stuck loop applying work feel tiresome 2019 got accepted medicine moved overseas partner start tearing u apart 3 week move drop med school stress break became way much handle especially since wa overseas back applying job old degree getting nowhere heavily depressed see past 25 strong feeling die year atm welcome death open hand tired life constantly shifting see past 25 25
Hey,"I posted it here and people didn't believe me back then, I cared about it before but I don't care anymore.

I'm serving in the military and I feel shit about it.
I feel broken inside, I changed in a very bad way.

I started having brake-downs and even wetting the bed.

I feel embarrassed, ashamed, and the worse part is that I still have 2 years left (I served 1 year so far).

I haven't told anyone about wetting the bed as I'm not 4 years old. And frankly speaking I just don't want to think about it.

Is it bad that I hate being around my family,I hate being around my family I get uneasy and start to get irritated. Both my dad and mom were alcoholics and physically and emotionally abusive in the past. Now I don’t even talk to them and when I do it’s in a robotic tone. I don’t hate my parents and I do sometimes feel bad for not being close to them but I can’t ignore how I feel. I don’t enjoy their company but I want the best for them. And before you judge me and call me a selfish son I wanna let you know that I’ve been beat with wires and fist my feet hands and mouth were once taped while I was beat. The abuse stopped when I started fighting back. They are also very controlling my mom is always on my back always hovering over me and I’m kinda annoyed by her she treats me like a little boy and like I can’t do nothing for myself. They limit me and I don’t wanna be around them.,alone-bitter,1,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/fehkoo/is_it_bad_that_i_hate_being_around_my_family/,hate around family get uneasy start get irritated dad mom alcoholic physically emotionally abusive past even talk robotic tone hate parent sometimes feel bad close ignore feel enjoy company want best judge call selfish son wanna let know beat wire fist foot hand mouth taped wa beat abuse stopped started fighting back also controlling mom always back always hovering kinda annoyed treat like little boy like nothing limit wanna around,bad hate around family,alone bitter,844,44,alone bitter hate around family get uneasy start get irritated dad mom alcoholic physically emotionally abusive past even talk robotic tone hate parent sometimes feel bad close ignore feel enjoy company want best judge call selfish son wanna let know beat wire fist foot hand mouth taped wa beat abuse stopped started fighting back also controlling mom always back always hovering kinda annoyed treat like little boy like nothing limit wanna around bad hate around family

i’m happy and it feels wrong,"i’ve struggled with depression for about 6-7 years (pre- high school. now i’m a sophomore in college). a lot of my sadness has come from relationships, being stuck in a shitty town, having friends but not having any GOOD friends, blah blah. i can confidently say i’m over my most recent breakup and i don’t really have any crushes on anyone, so that part of my depression has kinda weirdly disappeared? i don’t live at home so i finally have the freedom to go wherever and do whatever i want. i have the best friends i could ask for and some awesome roommates. my classes this semester are so low stress it’s kind of annoying and i’ve picked up new hobbies that are fun and make me feel good. 

but now i have a new problem. i’m happy. i think i’m like actually happy, or at least i’m content with how my life is going currently. but it feels wrong? i feel like i shouldn’t be happy and i feel guilty for feeling this way. i can’t remember one time in my life where i felt like this and it’s scary. like really scary. a very small part of me wants to go back and do something drastic to send me into another depression. but at the same time i’m like, no this is what you’ve been wanting your whole life don’t fuck it up now! just enjoy it! but it’s hard to enjoy because now i’m uncomfortable. this is all foreign and new and i don’t like it. sure, i was sad all the time before and could barely muster the energy to get out of bed and shower or eat, but as least i was comfortable. 

has anyone else ever felt like this? i feel kinda shitty for being uncomfortable and i just wanna know i’m not alone. i totally understand if i get 0 sympathy (like, who complains about being content with life?), but i really feel wrong. it’s like i lost a huge defining piece of myself and now i have no idea who i’m supposed to be or how i’m supposed to act without it.",zxndxr,2,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/feakna/im_happy_and_it_feels_wrong/,struggled depression 6 7 year pre high school sophomore college lot sadness ha come relationship stuck shitty town friend good friend blah blah confidently say recent breakup really crush anyone part depression ha kinda weirdly disappeared live home finally freedom go wherever whatever want best friend could ask awesome roommate class semester low stress kind annoying picked new hobby fun make feel good new problem happy think like actually happy least content life going currently feel wrong feel like happy feel guilty feeling way remember one time life felt like scary like really scary small part want go back something drastic send another depression time like wanting whole life fuck enjoy hard enjoy uncomfortable foreign new like sure wa sad time could barely muster energy get bed shower eat least wa comfortable ha anyone else ever felt like feel kinda shitty uncomfortable wanna know alone totally understand get 0 sympathy like complains content life really feel wrong like lost huge defining piece idea supposed supposed act without,happy feel wrong,zx nd x r,1856,28,zx nd x r struggled depression 6 7 year pre high school sophomore college lot sadness ha come relationship stuck shitty town friend good friend blah blah confidently say recent breakup really crush anyone part depression ha kinda weirdly disappeared live home finally freedom go wherever whatever want best friend could ask awesome roommate class semester low stress kind annoying picked new hobby fun make feel good new problem happy think like actually happy least content life going currently feel wrong feel like happy feel guilty feeling way remember one time life felt like scary like really scary small part want go back something drastic send another depression time like wanting whole life fuck enjoy hard enjoy uncomfortable foreign new like sure wa sad time could barely muster energy get bed shower eat least wa comfortable ha anyone else ever felt like feel kinda shitty uncomfortable wanna know alone totally understand get 0 sympathy like complains content life really feel wrong like lost huge defining piece idea supposed supposed act without happy feel wrong
Better days coming.,"So I’ve struggled with depression on and off my whole life. I graduated recently and was lucky enough to land a pretty decent job. However, since I’ve moved and started the job I’ve relapsed heavy. I know it’s common for people to be lonely when making a big move and being in a new environment. I tried to end it all when I was in hs and told myself I would never go back to that place. I decided to get help a few months ago when those thoughts came back and I’m glad I did. I won’t bore you with all the details but work was the reason for a lot of my issues so i decided to be proactive and change it. Well today i just got an offer at a company that I’ve wanted to work at since I started college! And best of all it’s back in the same town as all my friends who graduated with me. I know I will be happy there, more so than this place. And I’ll be surrounded by people who made me enjoy my life for those short 4 years. I’m hoping this was the change that I was looking for. I made every excuse as to why nothing would get better and to just live it out. I start next month!

Btw I signed up for BetterHelp for my therapy. It’s not for everyone but I’m very shy and have had bad experiences with psychiatrist and counselors. It was just more excuses I made to not get help.",Earwaxking,0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/fehh65/better_days_coming/,struggled depression whole life graduated recently wa lucky enough land pretty decent job however since moved started job relapsed heavy know common people lonely making big move new environment tried end wa h told would never go back place decided get help month ago thought came back glad bore detail work wa reason lot issue decided proactive change well today got offer company wanted work since started college best back town friend graduated know happy place surrounded people made enjoy life short 4 year hoping wa change wa looking made every excuse nothing would get better live start next month btw signed betterhelp therapy everyone shy bad experience psychiatrist counselor wa excuse made get help,better day coming,earwax king,1279,19,earwax king struggled depression whole life graduated recently wa lucky enough land pretty decent job however since moved started job relapsed heavy know common people lonely making big move new environment tried end wa h told would never go back place decided get help month ago thought came back glad bore detail work wa reason lot issue decided proactive change well today got offer company wanted work since started college best back town friend graduated know happy place surrounded people made enjoy life short 4 year hoping wa change wa looking made every excuse nothing would get better live start next month btw signed betterhelp therapy everyone shy bad experience psychiatrist counselor wa excuse made get help better day coming

Getting pummeled from all sides,"I'm drowning over here. I'm failing every single person in my life, being criticized by every single person in my life, being controlled by every single person in my life, and I don't know how to deal.

My abusive ex is fighting for custody of our daughter. He'll be granted overnights in a few weeks, when he's never spent more than six hours with her. She's going to be so scared. She's too young to understand why her mom isn't there. I've tried suggesting we transition slowly but he's refusing to do so unless I give him six more hours a week, ""in good faith.""

I have two weeks to pay $2k to a court appointed person, that I didn't ask for and can't get rid of, or I'll be held in contempt of court, resulting in a fine or jail time, even though I'm unemployed for another couple months. My dad is well able to help, but won't, because he ""doesn't want to get involved,"" but not because he isn't financially able.

My boyfriend is completely minimizing AND demonizing my feelings. Every single time I point out a problem, he plays victim and turns it around on me. When he picks on me and it hurts my feelings, I just need to toughen up and trust that he doesn't mean it. When I get upset that he tells me what to do, I just need to let go of this hatred for imagined authority. When he's super stressed to the point of being 85% negative all the time and I'm feeling neglected and unloved because of it, I just need to keep my feelings to myself because he doesn't need guilt on top of his stress.

My baby has been sick so she hasn't been sleeping well. She woke up at 4:30 this morning, when she normally gets up at 6:30, and I was trying to get her back down. Well I also live with my parents. And my stepdad told my mom that I was yelling at my daughter and stomping around the room to intimidate her, which isn't at all true. When I told my boyfriend that I was being stern with her, not yelling, he said that maybe I should change my stern voice because apparently it scares people. 

So yes, let me just do whatever the fuck everyone wants me to do and be who they want me to be because I have no autonomy or authority over my over damn life. Let me stop expressing my emotions, which means stop having emotions all together, to please all these fuckers in my life. Let me change something I don't even feel I'm doing *wrong* just to make someone else fucking happy.

And if I'm not happy?

Well, that's just too bad! Because apparently everyone else's feelings matter but mine.

I don't want to die, but I can't fucking live like this. Every waking moment of my life is just trying to please someone else. It's putting everyone else above me because if I don't, I'll be chastised or belittled or berated. No one can just let me be me and do what I do because they think they have some fucking hold on me and should be able to control what I do and say and think and feel.

I can't fucking LIVE like this. Who fucking can? But there's no way out. I'm unemployed until the summer. So I have to live with my parents. I have to listen to their bullshit. I can't get my ex to stop stalking me and harassing me and insulting me. The court is refusing to hold him accountable. I can't force my dad to keep me out of jail for something I have zero control over. I can't get my boyfriend to be more considerate of my feelings, but I can't break up with him either because then I'll *completely* fall apart. Those good moments with him are literally the only things keeping me functioning.

I honestly feel like if I didn't have skin, I'd be shattered. Not even just shattered, in pieces. Like a broken piece of tempered glass, split into so many pieces that they're impossible to count, and I get cut by them every single time I move. Just a walking, breathing flesh bag of blood and fragments.

And there's zero way out.

He said ""I will never forget you, but we will never see each other again"" as if I had already died. He knows I will. He acts like I'm already gone.

"Chronic Harm OCD sufferer experiencing awful depression, advice?","Hello. Depression has always been a secondary problem for me, with my main antagonist being severe Harm OCD. But since my relationship ended 8 months ago, I've been stuck in this horrific cycle of absolutely loathing myself, feeling heavy/tired and totally unmotivated to do anything. It's like I'm living in a 2 dimensional world. Nothing in life jumps out and catches my attention like it used to. I used to be quite creative but it's just taken a nose dive. Any work I do is utterly awful and I'm amazed I'm not been kicked off projects (I work freelance). I wake up and I just want to be dead, quite honestly. In fact in the last few weeks I've even found getting out of bed to be a monumental struggle in itself, where I'm almost in tears from the weight of everything.

I am getting help with a therapist and am on an SSRI/low dose anti psych. And I've taken their advice seriously in terms of behavioural activation and avoiding staying in bed. I've started cycling again (just done 20 miles today in fact). But I still feel utterly wretched and everything I do is laced with this horrible belief that this is the end and suicide is my only way out of the pain I'm going through. The years ahead fill me with dread (I'm in my 30s). With my Harm OCD I have a huge hatred of myself anyway, but lately things have just got so heavy. I'd just like to know if anybody can relate to my post and has any first person advice? Psychiatrists and therapists always feel so removed from the reality (for me, anyway) - I'd just like to hear from people who know what's like and have helped themselves.",WishIwasNormal123,2,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/fedu8v/chronic_harm_ocd_sufferer_experiencing_awful/,hello depression ha always secondary problem main antagonist severe harm ocd since relationship ended 8 month ago stuck horrific cycle absolutely loathing feeling heavy tired totally unmotivated anything like living 2 dimensional world nothing life jump catch attention like used used quite creative taken nose dive work utterly awful amazed kicked project work freelance wake want dead quite honestly fact last week even found getting bed monumental struggle almost tear weight everything getting help therapist ssri low dose anti psych taken advice seriously term behavioural activation avoiding staying bed started cycling done 20 mile today fact still feel utterly wretched everything laced horrible belief end suicide way pain going year ahead fill dread 30 harm ocd huge hatred anyway lately thing got heavy like know anybody relate post ha first person advice psychiatrist therapist always feel removed reality anyway like hear people know like helped,chronic harm ocd sufferer experiencing awful depression advice,wish wa normal 123,1595,64,wish wa normal 123 hello depression ha always secondary problem main antagonist severe harm ocd since relationship ended 8 month ago stuck horrific cycle absolutely loathing feeling heavy tired totally unmotivated anything like living 2 dimensional world nothing life jump catch attention like used used quite creative taken nose dive work utterly awful amazed kicked project work freelance wake want dead quite honestly fact last week even found getting bed monumental struggle almost tear weight everything getting help therapist ssri low dose anti psych taken advice seriously term behavioural activation avoiding staying bed started cycling done 20 mile today fact still feel utterly wretched everything laced horrible belief end suicide way pain going year ahead fill dread 30 harm ocd huge hatred anyway lately thing got heavy like know anybody relate post ha first person advice psychiatrist therapist always feel removed reality anyway like hear people know like helped chronic harm ocd sufferer experiencing awful depression advice
My friend saved my life today,"You’ve probably haven’t heard from me since I made that concerning post awhile ago, then me deleting it. Welp I’m alive still, but I was very close to ending it today. My head was spiraling more than I’ve ever felt, and light started to blur and noise was distorted. Keep in mind, I wasn’t dying or gaining out of consciousness, I was just walking around my school and I heard the noise of a helicopter, while the sunset was gleaming in my eye. I was just trying to find that damn helicopter since that noise was just consuming me, and my whole world was vanishing, and I lost my meaning completely. I just wanted to end it. I didn’t know how, but I knew I wouldn’t be alive tomorrow. My mind was gone.

I then sat down and cried. Through the hole of the tables outside, I saw a pair of converse. While crying and trying to hide my tears from the cheer team that just got back from practice, I saw friend’s converse who had just came back from 711. They were surprised to see me there, and gave me the rest of their iced coffee. They didn’t know I was crying since I played it off that I was sleeping. We spent another 30 minutes eating brownies and talking about our day.

First Therapy Sessions: sliding scale?,"Hi

I'm going to be seeing a therapist for the first time in a while, at the urging of my partner. For a long time, I've felt like my problems did not warrant a therapy session, so I am just now taking my situation more seriously. I can't continue on like this and I know it. so I'm going.

My problem is that I have minimal insurance (500$ for the year for mental health). My new therapist works on a sliding scale, but I don't know how much to pay. She's given me 100$ as an option, then I got overwhelmed and she told me to think about what I thought was fair. I might be able to get on my partner's insurance at some point, but I have no idea when,

I'm now terrified of not being able to afford therapy, because I can feel myself getting close to a breaking point. 

I'm so sorry if this isn't supposed to be posted on this subreddit. This was the only one I knew/have known for a while

"I was in relationship years ago with someone who dealt with depression, and I just found out my current SO started self harming, not sure how far back it goes.","I’m trying to understand what’s going on with my current SO, I don’t fully understand depression nor do I understand self harm. 
I spent 4 years with my ex who was severely depressed and had suicidal tendencies at his worst points. I tried so hard to be there for him but I eventually gave up when he forced me to leave him because he knew I would be better off without him. 

Now I’m with my current boyfriend, who has been amazing and my rock, but he just revealed that his cuts are actually his own doing. I’ve only seen it twice. He’s a normal happy guy with some family troubles, sometimes financial but he handles things rather well and optimistically. It’s hard to gauge him at times because he’s generally a happy guy but he breaks down easily when things start to pile on, understandably so. He is nowhere near how I would describe someone who is depressed, but now I’m not so sure because of the SH. 
Can someone help me understand what he might be going through? Should I be worrying for his life? I’m heartbroken because I hate seeing this pain he’s going through. I thought it was something I wouldn’t have to go through again, it was hard going through it in the past. I feel selfish for feeling like this, I feel almost upset that this is happening.

I'm afraid to try a different treatment that might really help me.,"So my depression is *very* treatment-resistant. I've lost track of how many different meds and med combos I've tried. Recently it was suggested that I try TMS (Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation), which has been proven to be effective for depression like mine. My psychiatrist referred me to the doctor who does it, but I've been putting off actually making the appointment because I'm scared.

You know how sometimes people don't like taking meds because they make them feel like they're not themselves anymore; like they make them feel numb or empty? It's sort of like that, except in reverse. I've had my depression for well over a decade, more than half my life, and I literally can't imagine what it'd be like if it actually got better. Would I still feel like me? I know that things would improve, obviously, but change is scary, and in a bizarre way, my depression is comfortable. It's been a constant for most of my life and I don't know who I'd be without it.

Where to go?,"Hi, 

As the title suggests, where to go or how to help yourself where my options are severely limited?
My GP can only organise pills for me. I have no way of acquiring a therapist. I have been severely depressed for past couple of weeks and mildly since about November.

I don't have a trusted parent, sibling or a friend that I could open up to. I tried a while ago but I ask to support me in functioning day to day, pushing me to work and they just tell me they're sorry or they wish they could help. You know, the empty ""You can talk to me, it will get better"". Then they cut contact. My boyfriend just says he doesn't know how to help me and has phases of randomly complimenting me or texting me to tell me he loves me for two days straight then he forgets all about it. I'm sure he tries his best but I just wish I had more support and he says ""he can't help me anymore than he does"" everytime. I feel so trapped. I always have to pretend I'm fine. I always cover up with humor. It seems like I'm insincere or dramatic when I finally snap and just say I'm a mess. 

I can't afford a therapist. My university counselling office won't help me. They offered a suicide hotline numbers (?) and  ""we're sorry but this isn't a psychological support that we do here"".

How to cope? Where to go?

"I’m 21, just recently realized my dad is a terrible person and my childhood fucked me up more than anyone can see. I feel hopeless and have no life skills. Think my family is cursed(?)","My dad is an immigrant and came the US in his 30’s after he married my 18 year old mother who was studying abroad in his home country.

He quickly became financially successful and moderately famous in his industry. Things that came to define him above anything else.

My parents had me 11 years into their marriage and I have no siblings. 

I was homeschooled for most of my childhood and super sheltered from everything in life. Never allowed to have sleepovers, rarely allowed to have friends over, had every moment of my life scheduled and micromanaged.  I was never encouraged to pursue anything except becoming a professional soccer player (which was never what I wanted to do, but something my dad wanted me to do as a way to live out his dreams through me vicariously.) 

He was never around. He financially supported me and my mom and lived in the same city as us most of the time, but was never there to parent me and was rarely even around on holidays or birthdays. He kept his things at our house, but came home maybe once a month, sometimes less. He always said he needed to be closer to work so he was staying at his friend’s house (everything in the whole city is a 30 minute drive or less, and he never worked for anyone but himself.) 

Now that I’m an adult, I understand he was living with various girlfriends though he was still married to my mom, and she always seemed to be waiting up for him to come home and finally be a dad/husband. 

I developed severe anorexia at 12, and my family seemed to ignore it even though I stopped growing, lost 40 pounds, was rarely eating, and was exercising 4-6 hours a day. When I was literally weeks away from death with a BMI of &lt;12, my mom finally took me to a doctor after my grandma begged her to because “something was really wrong with me.” The doctor told her I was  anorexic and recommended in-patient treatment and psychotherapy. My mom yelled at the doctor, said “there’s no way MY daughter is anorexic,” and stormed out of the office. 

For the next 6 months or so, I stayed at the same weight and, nightly, would sit down at the dinner table with my mom and cry for hours while she screamed at me to finish my food. I never went to therapy for the eating disorder and she denied every doctor who told her I was mentally ill. She was SURE I had tapeworms, a thyroid disease, celiac, or some other ailment that had caused me to lose 40% of my body weight. I stayed at a dangerously low weight until I was 16, which is the first year I went to school, and traded my ED for nightly sneaking out, binge drinking, and bulimia. 

When I was 16, I was almost arrested for trying to buy alcohol, and my dad found out and told me if I wanted alcohol I could just ask him. He started helping me sneak out and giving me alcohol whenever I wanted. I think he did this to drive a wedge between my mom and me, he always loved to have secrets that we would keep from her. He would take me around his 23 year old girlfriend and tell me to not tell my mom. In fact, he would blackmail me, saying things like “don’t tell mom about so and so, you would hate for her to find out about you sneaking out and partying right?” 

When I was 17, my dad lost all his businesses and wealth, and has still been unable to recover from the financial loss. He pinned all his happiness on money, and once it was gone he changed completely. Every time I’ve talked to him since then, all he’s talked about is how broke he is and how my mom caused his financial ruin and what a stupid idiot she is. He curses my mom around me almost every time he talks to me.

He had a long talk with me one night when I was 16. He told me that I should never have kids because they’ll ruin my life. He never wanted kids. He would be a multi millionaire and so happy and free if he had never had a family. My mom is a crazy lunatic and has only ruined his life and finances. 

I fell into a horribly abusive, 4 year relationship with a guy when I was 17. I bounced around from college to vocational school, and also had a moderately successful entertainment career. I’ve never been able to find footing anywhere. I feel like I can’t connect with anyone. I really don’t feel passion for anything and don’t feel like there’s any path in life that I want to take, though I do feel like I’m talented in multiple things. I’m awful at romantic relationships and friendships (maybe because I never had a healthy relationship example from my family, and never had long term friendships when I was growing up?) 

About a year ago, I was talking with my dad about how I wanted to get a job that made a lot of money like bottle service. He suggested I become a stripper. And so I did. I danced for a year, and he insisted I call him and tell him how much money I made every night, and he acted like I was so lucky because he “gave me permission” to do this. Like wtf I’m a grown adult who’s been living on my own since 18, and god knows I was putting in the work all on my own for all the money I made. 

Every time I see him he’s so negative and toxic and I realize now that a lot of the anxiety and problems I felt as a child (I’ve been suicidal literally since I can remember) stemmed from the insane toxic energy that always engulfed my family life. 

I’ve done a lot of psychedelics, and I really do have a good grip on spirituality and mindfulness, and know there’s something way bigger than this earth plane we live on. There are light forces and dark forces. The thing is, lately, I just don’t feel like I am meant to be blessed by the light forces. Like I was born out of darkness from a cursed family, and I am doomed to be miserable, depressed, and toxic just like my dad. He is not a good person. I think he’s a narcissistic sociopath and it scares me that half of my genes come from that. 

His dad was a total narcissist, no respect for women, I felt unexplainably awful vibes from him always. My paternal grandfather had a very successful business when he was younger, but somehow that all dissolved and he ended up completely broke with nothing to leave to his family, dementia, and a mindset that his children should take care of him (which they did, until his death last year.) My aunt put herself through unspeakable stress and pain to take care of my grandfather, who was completely ungrateful for it. 

Most of my dad’s family has ended up in a mental hospital by 70, and they’re all completely depressed or mentally ill, and I feel the same demons taking me under every day. I’ve felt dark forces around me since I can remember. I’ve seen my demons during nightmares and sleep paralysis. I think my abusive ex-boyfriend was influenced by the demons that follow me around. 

I can’t see anything good happening in my life long term. I fear I’m going to end up like everyone on my dad’s side. I recently talked about a lot of this stuff with my mom and she started crying and said she’s failed me in every way, she should’ve left my dad when I was little, and she wishes she never even married him because she was a teenager and literally only knew him for a few months before they got married. That hit so hard, because it just made me feel like my whole life was never even supposed to happen. I was just part of one giant fucked up mistake made by a naive 18 year old. 

I feel like I’m a lost soul, I wasn’t meant to exist, and because of that the dark energy got ahold of me. 

I don’t want to talk to my dad anymore. Am I wrong? I am questioning everything and I really hope I don’t live that long because I don’t see anyone in that family having any glimmer of a nice life over age 55. 

No one takes me seriously when I say my childhood fucked me up so much, because I grew up with a lot of material possessions, money, and a seemingly super involved mother. When people think of bad childhoods, they think of poverty, physical abuse, druggie parents, things like that. Maybe I’m a spoiled brat. But either way I’m just not happy, I can’t remember ever, ever being happy for more than a couple days at a time.

To all of those feeling isolated and suffering right now...,"I’ve learned that life is fucking sad sometimes. You start to think that maybe things aren’t going to get better at all. I’ve been at points which I think, it can’t get worse than this, but then I discover a new section of rock bottom, thinking, ah this is it!

 I assure you, There’s always something worse than what you’re going through. It can get worse. Per that same logic, there’s always the chance it gets better. I think I hold onto that and you should too.

 You might have realised at some point, people in your life leave. They come and go, and the only constant in your life is you. You have your back, and that’s what matters at the end of the day. Keeping this in mind, Take care of yourself and be proactive towards seeking friendships and human connections whenever possible. We humans are social creatures, so having this emotional connection can literally save you. It saved me, at least. 

I’m sorry about whatever situation you are facing it right now, but do know that you have a power to improve it. At this point, things can either improve or worsen, and the amazing this is that you have the choice.",never-mind-la,0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/fega6j/to_all_of_those_feeling_isolated_and_suffering/,learned life fucking sad sometimes start think maybe thing going get better point think get worse discover new section rock bottom thinking ah assure always something worse going get worse per logic always chance get better think hold onto might realised point people life leave come go constant life back matter end day keeping mind take care proactive towards seeking friendship human connection whenever possible human social creature emotional connection literally save saved least sorry whatever situation facing right know power improve point thing either improve worsen amazing choice,feeling isolated suffering right,never mind la,1123,59,never mind la learned life fucking sad sometimes start think maybe thing going get better point think get worse discover new section rock bottom thinking ah assure always something worse going get worse per logic always chance get better think hold onto might realised point people life leave come go constant life back matter end day keeping mind take care proactive towards seeking friendship human connection whenever possible human social creature emotional connection literally save saved least sorry whatever situation facing right know power improve point thing either improve worsen amazing choice feeling isolated suffering right
My relationship with Instagram.,"My relationship with Instagram is complicated. While I do see it as a good way to promote certain things like my amateur photography for example, I also feel like it’s repetitive to an extent. I feel like whenever I go on there, it’s mostly the same old kinds of posts. Gym selfies, selfies in general, people who brag about their rich lifestyles, the list goes on and on. Witnessing those kinds of posts over and over just ain’t good for my social anxiety and depression.

"When you lose the will to live, you got a big fucking problem","No longer have any passion for my interests, or even any passion for life tbh. Im lonely af, feel worthless and hopeless. I dont want to kill myself though my mind tells me i do. But id much rather be happy, thrive and prosper. Its strange for sure. I'd like to say im a hard worker, im intuitive and a problem solver. There's things i aspire to do, and know im phyiscally and mentally capable of doing in one part of my mind. 

The other part that's always lurking is telling me im a worthless piece of shit and cant do anything and that even if i was successful still nobody would care so whats the point. Recently ive been losing the battle with that other part, and when my mind tries to rationalise my life situation (which isnt even that bad) and thoughts, the conclusion it comes to, is self termination. Sometimes i get too overwhelmed by it and imagine having a gun and pointing it under my chin. I pull the trigger and imagine it all going away almost instantly. It doesnt make me feel better as i do it in moments i might have legit pull the trigger in the heat of the moment. It makes the real me glad i dont have a gun (i live in uk so i cant really get one all that easily anyway).

Edit: I'm feeling calmer now, my demons have been but to bed until tomorrow (i hope). Just want to add, most of the things that my mind perceives as major fucking problems like having no friends or girfriend can be overcome, its not a terminal illness, even if my mind wants me to see it that way. I say this to people a lot but i believe it, with a healthy mind there isnt much a human cant overcome. Look at tyson fury, he was a pork pie with the jelly around it, he was a coke addict. And by getting help with his mental health hes now heavy weight champion of the world. Then people like caroline flack (sorry if i misspelled) got herself in a pretty bad sitaution, and her mental health issues made it seem 1000x worse to her. With a healthy mind she could have gone to court and taken her punishment, and dealt with the repercussions. It would have been hard as heck and taken a toll on her for sure. But it could have been done.

Wanting to die or kill yourself is not a rational thought. Theres nothing rational at all about poor mental health. I think it has helped me a lot understanding the science a lil bit. Just the fact that these chemical imbalances can fuck us up in so many ways. Thinking about that definitely helps bring perspective.",HelloThere2818,7,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/fe39an/when_you_lose_the_will_to_live_you_got_a_big/,longer passion interest even passion life tbh im lonely af feel worthless hopeless dont want kill though mind tell id much rather happy thrive prosper strange sure like say im hard worker im intuitive problem solver thing aspire know im phyiscally mentally capable one part mind part always lurking telling im worthless piece shit cant anything even wa successful still nobody would care whats point recently ive losing battle part mind try rationalise life situation isnt even bad thought conclusion come self termination sometimes get overwhelmed imagine gun pointing chin pull trigger imagine going away almost instantly doesnt make feel better moment might legit pull trigger heat moment make real glad dont gun live uk cant really get one easily anyway edit feeling calmer demon bed tomorrow hope want add thing mind perceives major fucking problem like friend girfriend overcome terminal illness even mind want see way say people lot believe healthy mind isnt much human cant overcome look tyson fury wa pork pie jelly around wa coke addict getting help mental health heavy weight champion world people like caroline flack sorry misspelled got pretty bad sitaution mental health issue made seem 1000x worse healthy mind could gone court taken punishment dealt repercussion would hard heck taken toll sure could done wanting die kill rational thought nothing rational poor mental health think ha helped lot understanding science lil bit fact chemical imbalance fuck u many way thinking definitely help bring perspective,lose live got big fucking problem,hello 2818,2450,61,hello 2818 longer passion interest even passion life tbh im lonely af feel worthless hopeless dont want kill though mind tell id much rather happy thrive prosper strange sure like say im hard worker im intuitive problem solver thing aspire know im phyiscally mentally capable one part mind part always lurking telling im worthless piece shit cant anything even wa successful still nobody would care whats point recently ive losing battle part mind try rationalise life situation isnt even bad thought conclusion come self termination sometimes get overwhelmed imagine gun pointing chin pull trigger imagine going away almost instantly doesnt make feel better moment might legit pull trigger heat moment make real glad dont gun live uk cant really get one easily anyway edit feeling calmer demon bed tomorrow hope want add thing mind perceives major fucking problem like friend girfriend overcome terminal illness even mind want see way say people lot believe healthy mind isnt much human cant overcome look tyson fury wa pork pie jelly around wa coke addict getting help mental health heavy weight champion world people like caroline flack sorry misspelled got pretty bad sitaution mental health issue made seem 1000x worse healthy mind could gone court taken punishment dealt repercussion would hard heck taken toll sure could done wanting die kill rational thought nothing rational poor mental health think ha helped lot understanding science lil bit fact chemical imbalance fuck u many way thinking definitely help bring perspective lose live got big fucking problem

"I don't have depression. but I need advice, I tried to post in so many Sub Reddits but it keeps deleting","Hey, I'm in a 14 year old female (9th grade), and right now I'm in a low point in my life ( no I am not one of those im14andthisisdeep girls haha). At the moment I really don't want to discuss everything yet, but there is this one situation I do.

ALSO please mind that I am bad at expressing myself, so this may sound repetitive.

I'll try to list everything...

My friend group consists of around 9 people (I think, it keeps adding up, and I'll explain later). There is this girl in my ""friend group"" (can't really say 'friends"" because I am not really close to them) who keeps avoiding me. She started to avoid me around the start of the school year. She started show her dislike around me when my friends were talking jokingly, (I can't recall properly, sorry) that if they were not going to receive any flowers in Valentines Day, hence saying some people in my friend group do, they would group up and watch a movie together. I was curious, so I asked something related to it (sorry, can't remember exactly :(, I think I said something like ""Oh! What movie?"" or ""When?"" (like when would this event take place) ). She then rudely replies with ""Who are YOU!?"". This other girl from my friend group just stared at me (Not in a rude way, but in a way I can't read her expression) I was kind of hurt then.

This behaviour kept continuing. Around a few days later, I went to the spot where my friends sat, and sat next to the girl who apparently dislikes me. She IMMEDIATELY stood up and rushed (no kidding, she ran away from me) to the opposite side, and sat there. I just blankly stared at her, again hurt the frick for me. The group stayed silent, then same girl who looked at me then said ""Oh, I know why"".

Because of this, I was in a shit mood. The shittiest mood I've been compared to the whole day. I was walking to my HSIE class (where 2 of my other ""friends"" were in). I asked one of them, (for her privacy, I'll call her ""Sally"") why (let's call her Fiona) keeps avoiding me. Sally replies saying I said something to Fiona *A FEW MONTHS AGO* that pissed her off. Sally then tells me to not worry, and that Fiona is a *""petty person""* . (Honestly, I thought okay, wtf? I actually was actually tearing up a bit due to sadness, not to the extent of crying though)

Timeskip to a few days, (with Fiona going to the opposite side of the friend circle *As AlWaYs!1!,* and with me now, I try no to be near her, but even being the slight nearest, she goes even further away). I asked someone who was friends/close to Fiona while going out of my commerce class to the next period. I explained the situation to her (*whilst clinging to the edge of the wall like that Yandere girl from Yandere simulator because I am awkward af, seriously*). She also responds to something similar. She said Fiano used to act up like that to her and I just need to get used to it. (I was tearing up AgAin (not to the extend to cry) \*le fucking sigh\*). She then adds ""Oh, you don't like it?"". She then says something similar that Sally said before ""She is just petty"" (ugh so tired of hearing that word from everyone).

Timeskip\~\~

She keeps avoiding me, not sitting next to me. Recently I was going to the bathroom with another girl, whilst walking back to class, Fiona responds ""Hey -name-"" and ignores me (wow, how nice...). When I talk, she glares at me. And more, more, MORE negative reactions to me.

Today, I had HSIE class after lunch. I was 'complaining' (not in an annoying way) about how boring it was. And then fucking Piano responds with ""Maybe if you had friends"".

I pause, literally a flash of emotions hit me: hurtfulness, pain, frustration, anger, you name it. I had just enough with her play and said something around (maybe I should of responded differently, more direct? and not nicely?) ""Why do you hate me, whatever you did, just tell me, I will say sorry"" and blah blah blah. (Sorry, I only started to notice I was too kind this year, and that it lead to me being hurt, and people taking the advantage to go on top of me (yeah, there are a few girls, again? why would you hate me?, who dislike me. I won't talk about it because this thread would be WAYYY too long) ).

Fiona then replies with ""Nothing/No you did nothing wrong. \*I just hate you."" .\*I was spreading in a bad mood. Bad morning, had a maths test, didn't sleep because I was staying up studying and also extremely VERY stressed!

The group went silent, stopped talking. I had enough, I don't want to be apart of the group (explain later). I don't want to be near HER. I. fucking.had.enough. I abruptly left the group (sorry, should've mentioned earlier, but I do that more and more often when she does something shitty to me) and walked around, staring at happy (I mean I don't really know) people with their friends, fake smiling.(ugh for some reason I approached some closely just to stare at them.

Ugh fucking amazing life.

Also I will talk about my friends now.

They weren't a fixed group, especially around 8th grade. You know when there is a new student, and the teacher would just ~~force~~ put them in your group? Well, welcome to mine!

Anyways, my group is basically where new people come. There has been 1 from 8th grade (never met her before) and an old friend who came back(left). There would be another girl who would hang out in my group and another one (that one more now). This year, 9th grade, already on our 6th week, 2 girls were introduced (I don't even remember their names).

There are certain things that creates a friend group. For example, if you like books, you stay with bookworms (the ""bookworm group""). Because of this (tho, nothing like that made me feel close to my friends), my friends group isn't so closely connected to one another. Like lunch is so fucking boring now. When was the last time I had fun during recess or lunch?(Note\_ 4 out of 5 days I have school meetings on lunch, just SRC things!) Now people just eat due to boredom, and half of them go on their phones. No (little) interactions created. I am quiet, but not the most quiet in the group, now I am. When they talk, they laugh, I don't.

But seriously, I never felt close to my friends, they would go to parties, parks, movies with each other, where am I? at home. They had photos posted on instagram one time of them in a party. They tagged each other, not including ME (only one, thanks. Btw not close to her though). They printed photo cards of those pictures and shared them to each other as memory (some are on their phone case). One picture was the korean hand heart (that saranghaeyo thingy) they made together as a circle. (Wow, like that didn't;t hurt)

Im not close to them, I feel lonely being around them, and I have no one to talk to, no one to trust. Where do I go now? How do I make friends? Because of this, I've reached out bout my loneliness online (in a few different platforms) to talk to. It's nicer to talk to someone online though.. They don't know me and keep this secret...

Sorry, this was longer than I thought. There is more I want to talk about (I never thought something that I thought was small would end up being this long). I may post some more in the future.

If there is something you want me to elaborate on, please feel free to ask! (But I won't respond if it is too personal hehe).

I think this is my final straw and I am scared,"Warning: this is VERY long. I'm not sure what the purpose of it really is but just wanting to put this out there in the world. Maybe I'll get some advice, maybe someone will read it and realize they are not alone.

I’ve started writing this so many times and lost motivation half way through. This is yet another attempt, let’s see what happens.

I’m a 30 year old woman, I work as a photographer for a fashion company with a degree in Graphic Design, volunteer at a cat rescue 2 days a week, and suffer from depression and social/general anxiety disorder.

I first realized my teen angst wasn’t just a “phase” sometime in my early 20’s. As a teenager I would do the normal things: drink, do drugs, smoke weed. I would also write a lot but this writing, in hindsight, was some of the deepest cries for help. I’ve since lost that precious notebook, but I did come upon snippets of that “poetry” in my other sketchbooks. The stuff wasn’t anything out of the ordinary - I grew up listening to emo and other such heart wrenching music - and the style was really just lyrics trying to artistically describe the dark cloud that was inside of me every minute of every day. I lost interest in that activity around the age of 20.

I was always a shy person. I played with friends during school, but I was never allowed to have anyone over or go to anyone’s house. As a result, I was always found by myself in the yard skipping rope alone. My parents brought me to Canada when I was 9 years old in order to expand my options for education. I was born in Russia where there wasn’t much choice at the time to do anything with your life other than engineering, medicine or teaching. In that aspect, I thank them. I was able to attend an art school in Toronto and attain my Graphic Design degree which my anxious artistic brain appreciates.

When I arrived in Canada I didn’t speak much English and was in an ESL program. In that first year, 4th grade, I was bullied for not speaking the language. Some girls quickly realized that it would be fun to put rocks (the little pebbles from the playground) down my pants while we had “carpet time” (when all the kids gather around crossed legged on the floor in front of the teacher during a lesson.) They knew I wouldn’t say anything, partly because I couldn’t physically, partly because I couldn’t mentally. Kids would kick my chair constantly as they walked by, someone even throw things at me from the back. I brushed it off, went on with it. I did have two great friends (one of which is still in my life albeit we aren’t close.)

This childish bullying subsided after the first year. I went off to another school in grade 5 after moving buildings with my parents. 6th grade was split. It was yet another school (moving from elementary to middle school) and then half way through 6th grade, after establishing quite a solid group of new friends, I was transferred to a new school after yet another move by my parents. I had to start over with the friend thing and luckily I befriended a girl right away. She was also an outcast, being extremely tiny and skinny for her age and also didn’t fit in with the “cool popular kids.” Here I was laughed and looked down upon for being new, having 1 friend, and being so extremely shy. After a while I became close with another girl, let’s call her Jessica. 7th grade went by bearably with her around, outside minor incidents like having the basketball thrown at my head during recess. I was also developing extremely bad acne, so I was doomed to be the ugly shy girl for the next few years.

Ending of 8th grade is where the real trouble started with Jessica. She had an “in” with the cooler kids in the grade and being so attached to her, I got to hang out with the group occasionally. This is where we started “relationships” with two boys. She was with lets call him Andrew and I was with let’s call him Mike. We would hang out after school a lot and one day I brought them all over to my house. Mike took me down to my parent’s cellar at one point and where I thought I would have my first kiss, my hands were forced down onto his penis. I didn’t know how to retaliate so I went with it. Instead of a first kiss, I gave my first hand job. The next time we hung out was at the movies. I was brought to the bathroom for what I thought was a make out session but turned out to be an attempt at a blow job. I can’t remember whether I went through with it, I just remember crying that evening. I soon found out that Andrew and Mike had a bet going of who would get their dick sucked first and Jessica agreed to bring me into the group so they could use me for that bet. These things bled into high school. The rumours started that I was a slut and were reinforced with photos being distributed throughout the school. The photos were of me wearing see through mesh pants in provocative poses that Jessica took of me in her room one night when we were having a fun “fashion” night. She wore them too, although somehow the photos of her never got distributed. 

Finally a new girl came to the school lets call her Beth and finally things seemed to calm down. We had a great friendship going and were inseparable during high school (to the point where people were calling us lesbians.) I even attended her wedding two years ago, she’s a beautiful human being. I tried my best to have a normal life. I threw myself into art. I would come to school at 7 in the morning so spend time in the photography dark room lab. I got great marks in my classes and my teachers loved me. Of course throughout this time I did the regular teenage girl stuff. I liked boys, I would make out with them. I was already well trained in the hand job department so guys learned to hand me over to their friends once they were done with me. I just did it. It made them happy. And in my mind, that made me good at it. Why not do the thing that I felt I excelled at? Of course none of that behaviour helped the growing rumours. 

I first tried drugs in 10th grade. Beth and I would skip school, pop ecstasy, spend the day together. This went on for about a year in the 11th grade where my marks drastically plummeted. I’m not sure what the triggering factor for me to stop was, but I managed to graduate high school on the honour roll. At the end of 12th grade I met lets call him Sam. We dated for 2 years, I lost my virginity to him, but I will always remember doubting his intentions. Did he stay with me for the sex? Did he only want me around because I would smoke weed with him? It didn’t matter. I lost romantic interest in him after a year but stayed together despite us fighting because it was comfortable and a habit I just didn’t want to, or couldn’t break.

I got into my top school of choice and spent the first year working hard. After my break up with Sam, I met lets call him Dale. It was interesting at first. He would show up at my work almost daily and chat and finally we started going on real dates. He brought me gifts and showered with me with attention. I now realize that it was borderline stalker behaviour. He wouldn’t take no for an answer even if I didn’t really feel like doing anything. The thing with Dale is kind of an on and off ordeal. We were never fully together but would hang out often usually drinking or going on drives. I was starting to get really put off by him, but one night he insisted on hanging out. As you well know by now, I have trouble saying no. So we went to the bar, got a buzz going and then went driving. (I know how shameful it is to drink and I drive. I know first hand because I almost killed my friend during a drunk driving episode. I haven’t done it since and will never do it again.) We were in the car and I was completely insistent that this was a non sexual meet up. But he wouldn’t stop trying to kiss me, to push my hands on to his crotch, then pushing my head down, asking me to just suck it a little. I did it just to make him shut up so I could go home. I haven’t seem him since them. I refused to talk to him and eventually had to block him. To this day he tries to make attempts at communication but nothing dangerous. 

The truly destructive behaviour started around 22 when I began to frequent parties. At first it was drinking, and a lot of it. Then I met a 28 year old man lets call him Izack. He was a DJ and very much into the rave party scene. It was with him when I tried coke for the first time at the age of 23 or 24. Lets just call the rest a blur. I would party twice a week, heavily on drugs, go to school completely hung over. Long story short, I just managed to graduate, scraping by with a warning letter and passing marks given to me probably only out of the kindness of my professor’s heart. I loved Izack. He was older, had more experience, best sex I’ve ever had and he made me forget everything and everyone. He lived downtown in an apartment with two other roommates who also loved to party and we all got along quite well. The sanctuary of that apartment was heavenly. I would be able to spend all my time there away from my strict Russian parents. Then Izack started going on the road a lot more due to his DJ career flourishing. When he was away, I would come to his place and clean everything. I bought him a huge new TV for his room. I wanted him to come home to a beautiful place. In my mind that was me saying thank you for letting me stay with him rent free for so many days of the week. 

About a year into our relationship, I went for a gynaecologist check up which was followed by a phone call saying that I have an STD. They told me to get myself and my partner into the office so we could be given medication. It was nothing overly serious, cleared up with a few pills but I had to have a serious conversation with Izack. He swore on his life that he never cheated on me. He begged me to believe him which after hours upon hours of me crying and pleading, I finally did. But I never got over the nagging feeling that something wasn’t right. So after a month of uncertainty, over the phone on my birthday (I remember that day so clearly), I asked him one more time. I’m not sure what made him tell me truth this time around, but yes, of course he slept with someone on tour and yes that is how I contracted the STD.

I was a complete and utter wreck for the next few months. The drugs and alcohol increased. I went on Tinder and began my first sex binge. At one point I managed to sleep with 6 different men in one week. All I wanted to do was to forget the hurt and I didn’t know how. Again, all of this is very blurry so I can’t say the exact moment that Izack came back into my life but he did. I remember going to a bar to meet him to get closure, to finally say I forgive him and that I’m moving on. That meeting ended up with me in his apartment and sex. We then got “back together”, continued the destructive behaviour until his next tour where he slept with someone again. I let that one go easily since we never stated that we were officially a couple again. I think this is where I learned how to numb my brain from hurt. I wasn’t mad at him anymore, I just quietly walked away and threw myself into my second huge sex binge on Tinder. After a few months of this, I met a guy lets call him Jon. 

We dated for something close to a year. This relationship was also fuelled by alcohol, drugs and parties. But at this point I didn’t want another life. The relationship involved me crying almost every day at work with something abusive he may have said to me that day. For example, he loved to make me feel like an idiot for asking him why it took him hours to answer a text massage. I was told I was crazy on an almost daily basis. I will fast forward to the end, where a girl (who is now a friend) reached out to me saying that she was also dating Jon, for 6 months now. She spotted us at a party kissing, and lost her mind. Apparently she had no knowledge of me for the long while they were together. It turns out, that we weren’t the only ones. I came to the knowledge that he had slept with 8 different people during the span of being with me. This included his upstairs neighbour who I was constantly told not to worry about. 

I laughed at this. I didn’t cry, I didn’t feel angry, I laughed, pulled out my phone and on to the next Tinder binge I went.

It took me about 6 months to get into my next relationship. This one was with a kind man who would never do a thing to hurt me. It lasted for about 2 years. I met his parents and he met mine. We were talking about marriage and moving in together but it ended up falling apart during our search for an apartment. We just weren’t right for each other.

So this is where I am now. 30 years old, living back with my parents. I have since stopped the partying because that life doesn’t satisfy me anymore and my body can’t handle it. I have been coke free for about a year now mainly because I can’t afford it. But I drink. I drink several times a week because I can’t stand my job. I drink because I feel trapped in my own mind. I drink because of my living situation. I drink because nothing I do excites me. I drink about 3 times a week and once I crack a bottle of wine, there is no way I can stop. That bottle is getting drunk to the last drop and more often than not, a second one gets opened and lasts about half way until I pass out. 

The job thing - realized I’m the only one who can help myself there so I have been taking lots of photos and editing them in an effort to update my portfolio but sitting down and editing those photos sober just isn’t an option. I go to work, I laugh with my coworkers, but at the end of the day, the only thing that makes me happy and that I took forward to is that next drink. I started exercising and have been continuing to do so pretty consistently but I always fall off the boat because I can’t stay excited and motivated. 

Last night I came home to my collection of wine bottles all out and displayed in front of me by my dad. My mom discovered the first bottle in my closet when she couldn’t find my cat, or so she says. She then proceeded to go through every crevice of my room and pulled out the 20 or so I had hidden. Long story short, my life of drinking after work and during my own photo editing hours is over and I am terrified. I feel like I have nothing happy to come home to. I spent all last night crying and today is the first day I didn’t show up to work because of this. The thing is - I don’t know if I want to stop. I’ve had thoughts of suicide since my early teenage years and they have never gone away. I’ve cut myself on numerous occasions. I have dabbled with the idea of overdosing on my anxiety and depression medication. I did go into therapy for a few months but that turned out way too pricey for my minimal salary. My dad has offered to pay for my therapy last night, but this is an offer I’m not sure I want to take. I just want it to be over. The only times things are okay in my brain is when I am sleeping, or when I am heavily buzzed. I don’t have children, nor a boyfriend and I have maybe 2 friends, so I’m finding it difficult to see a purpose to go on. 

I would like to finish by saying how awful I feel about putting this out there. The amount of times the word “I” is used is upsetting and selfish since I know there are people out there who have it way worse than me. Like my parents have pointed out numerous times, I have nothing to be sad about. I have a good job, a warm house, food and water. I have a car that my dad so kindly gave to me when he bought himself a new one. And they are right. I have it so good. But inside, that dark cloud just won’t lift and there is no way I can describe it in words to someone who hasn’t felt the pull of it.

Thank you, from the bottom of my heart to anyone who read this fully, attempted to read it, or even glanced at it. I am very scared and for some reason the only thing I thought of this morning was writing

I think I need to leave my partner of 10 years,"My Girlfriend and I have been together for ten years and I don't know what to do anymore. She suffers from depression, anxiety and severe OCD.

Over the last couple of years here anxiety has worsened and over the last few months it's just too much for me, we don't see anybody anymore, if we do she has a panic attack before it and i've ended up having to cancel plans. It's our nieces third birthday party tomorrow and we were supposed to be going to stay up at my parents for the weekend and she doesn't want go. Fair enough, but I have been seeing my family less and less because of her needing her weekends to herself.

She's not from here so has no family or friends here who aren't mine so she really feels like she has nobody else but I'm exhausted. I can ask her family and friends from back home to talk to her but she doesn't want me to tell anyone. She believes she is just in the way and makes everyone's life shit, I try and tell her it's not true but it's so deep rooted into her mind that she just think she'd be better off dead, she's threatened suicide before so I feel like if I leave her even for this weekend she would kill herself as it's not really a threat but just her mindset of thinking she's better off dead. Idk anymore, I really don't. I don't even know if this is just kme being an asshole i'm just lost and confused and tired. I still love her but she just doesn't care about life anymore.

She stopped taking medication about a year ago as she thought it was making it worse, I respected her wishes and tbh, sometimes it seemed fine but lately it's absolutely not fine and she refuses to go back on any form of medication.

I lost my youth to school,"I know that a lot of people say that they lost their younger years to anxiety and depression. There is no doubt that I've definitely lost a lot of years to those same things, but I feel like a large portion of my life has been wasted in school. 

Of course there is a lot of useful things schools teaches that can be applied in every day life, but school has become the worst part of my day, which is especially troubling since it takes up such a large part of it. And after school, I'm just so drained and it makes me so sad to be alive. 

You'll probably have it in most school systems regardless of country, but American school are just such a shitty environment for people who have mental issues. How am I even supposed to properly deal with these issues when I'm constantly bombarded with all this schoolwork? How am I supposed to experience life and enjoy it when I'm trapped in an environment that worsens my mental health and anxiety? 

It's my last year of high school, but I still can't help but feel like I would be happier having dropped out. Realistically, the long term would look worse, but school environments are so toxic a lot of the time. The pressure to conform is just so strong and I don't know how other people feel, but it almost makes me hate being different, it makes me want to be ""normal""

Today was actually a good day.,"Hello everyone! I, as well as most people on the subreddit, have depression. I've been struggling with it for a few years. Recently I was prescribed with welbutrin. I must say that I cant express how much better I've been doing. I still have my moments at night but it's definitely not as bad. I've been struggling with my weight for a while as well but I was just laying in bed and had a weird switch get flipped and now I want to change my diet, i want to start going to the gym and be active. It's crazy because I'm lazy as fuck. Maybe doing this will help a lot with my depression. 

I'm scared though because a few years ago I broke my back while playing football. I was really active outdoors. I played football for the school, I kayaked, hiked, etc. Not being able to do those things has caused me to gain a bunch if weight and become insanely depressed. I lost feeling in my toes for 6 months after the initial accident. I wasn't able to do anything active. My toes are fine now but the fact that I'm not able to do what I used to do because of the accident has caused me to be depressed. I dont want to be depressed anymore, I'm sure everyone can relate. I want to get my life back the way it was and the only way I can do it is to step out of my comfort zone and find someone who will be willing to help me achieve my goal. 

Although it may be difficult, I know if I try my hardest I can achieve my goal. I apologize for the rant but this sudden change in my mindset has got me really motivated and honestly a bit emotional. I was scared I'd never find a way out of this rut. I'm also scared to lose this motivation. I dont want this to be a small fluke of motivation and then tomorrow I'm right back at where I was. But I shouldn't focus on tomorrow. 


Anyways again sorry for the rant but I couldn't bottle it up.

I’m starting to feel like I’m not meant for this world anymore,"I’m 17, and I’ve been feeling this way ever since I was 15. I have no friends, social anxiety and I’ve been homeschooled since I was 5. And to top it all off, I have asperger’s syndrome. I’d give away everything I have just to have at least one real friend who understands me and just to be normal.

My anxiety has gotten so bad that I can barely even go out anymore. I for some reason have a huge fear of kids around my age. I almost had a panic attack just for checking out my new college with my mum. I don’t think I’ll ever make it there. I like a lot of stuff that I’m sure no one my age likes and I get angry at my relatives for no reason. 

I hate being a teen. Why do hormones exist? Why is everything so complicated? Why am I losing my mind? I never used to have to worry about any of this shit as a little kid. I wish I could go back in time and undo whatever the fuck it was that made me this way. I come from a good family, so it’s not family related. Only thing I do is isolate myself from the entire world + my family by just staying in my room playing games and watching videos. I can’t do anything else.

Depression from Chronic Iniury,"Hi all, I’ve dealt with mild depression most of my life and handle it decently through medication, on and off therapy and CBT.  

However I’ve had 3 failed shoulder surgeries since 2016 and my shoulder pain triggers relapses into anger, depression, and feeling bad for myself.   I can’t play basketball anymore which I loved, I have trouble holding and playing with my two young daughters as well.  When I try something that I can no longer do (our daughter on my shoulders or shoot hoops in the driveway) it usually means I will be down for the rest of the day. 

I know people deal with much more serious strokes of misfortune than a bad arm but I often spiral into feeling bad for myself and being mad at myself for the basketball plays that led to the original injuries.  

Does anyone recommend a book, a method of CBT or any advice for me to deal with this better?

Am I faking my feelings?,"I've seen people question this before, but never identified with it enough to pay attention until now. So, here is the post.

I will frame unnecessary explanations with ""//"", in case anyone reading wants to skip. Although I'd like to warn you that this post is somewhat long regardless, as I like to explain things.

I've been considering myself unworthy (of a real friend, of feeling better, of complaining) since a long time, as I have a nice life, or because that I'm not feeling as bad as many other people who are said to be depressed. I obviously never wanted to be sad, nor to experience bad things, but I wanted to be worthy of some certain things I felt I needed. Over time I began feeling worse and worse, to a point where I compare myself more than I used to do, where almost everything upsets me. 

//For example, let's say there is a character I relate to and am happy about being alike. That used to be a source of motivation. Now when I see this character, I can only think of how much better this said persona is compared to myself, and how I can never be like them. When I look at something I value, rather than being happy I feel worried of what might happen to them. Or, when entering a new season I mourn the previous, alongside all the time I wasted.//

I'm mostly worried, stressed, or sad. The thing is that there is no clear reason for me to feel so. I sometimes question if I myself feel that way..



I also am having a hard time figuring my feelings for over a year. There are some occasions where I thought I didn't feel anything, but couldn't help crying.

The reason I'm writing this post is that, while watching a show, a character explained a 'negative' habit of the other, which I ultimately related to. It's not something I consider to be really bad. However, after that scene I couldn't somehow focus to the episode. My interest faded to a point. It was almost as if I was reacting to what was said, but I don't even care that much. The character cared, but not me. Was I impersonating his emotions? Or am I just faking all these to feel worthy? I cannot understand this. Am I really sad or am I just kidding myself?

I can barely read my own feelings, beliefs, and thoughts at this point. Like, I still know what they are, but I can't feel that. Not always, but mostly it's like a colourless, pitcureless page of information. ""I feel this, I think that."" but, do I really?

Hating what I used to love,"I don't know if this is the right place to post about this, but I thought I would give it a shot.

I've been an artist my whole life, ever since I can remember. I went through many years of art school, and while studying I was doing well. Art has been synonymous with my identity forever, and I've always wanted to be an artist more than anything else.

But I've also had mental health issues my entire life, and I've gone through a couple of periods of terrible depression in the past. I've been medicated since I was a child, so that's helped most of the time. But now, starting last autumn, I've gone into a depressive period that's a bit different than the previous ones. 

I think a combination of my medication losing efficacy and experiencing an artistic burnout are the reasons for this depression. I did two solo shows recently and have been pushing myself to draw so much, so I think burnout is very likely. In any case, I started to notice that I didn't enjoy drawing anymore.

Drawing became a terrible, dreaded chore. It started to feel like way too much work - and that work was not interesting or exciting. The work was also difficult and just SO much. SO many lines. Honestly, when I think about drawing I start to feel physically unwell. 

I've been advised to take a break from drawing, and I'm doing so. I haven't actually drawn anything for about a couple of weeks, and I'm going for one month. 

I'm just so terrified that I'll never enjoy drawing again. I can't even remember what it feels like to not hate drawing. But I still want to be an artist so much. Plus, I honestly don't have any other hobbies unrelated to art that I could focus on. Nothing else really interests me.

I should also mention that I'm switching medications right now, and I'm about to go onto a full dose of my new medication (which is actually one that's worked for me in the past).  

I've never experienced anything like this, and I'm so scared.

My family was supposed to leave the house for a few hours, which would give me time to do it. They didn't leave and I'm so angry. It's not fair on them. They couldn't know. But I'm still so angry. I'm not supposed to be alive right now and yet, here I am. And it's all because they decided not to go. If I had chosen not to, been moments away and stopped because I'm a coward, that would have been fine. But no. I don't even get to blame myself for it.

Questions regarding therapy,"So I just talked to my parents today for the first time regarding that I want to get therapy. I just have a few questions (they may be hard to answer, so bare with me, I just want to know what to expect): 

1) idk if this makes sense, but some of my typical depressive thoughts seem to not be as accessible when i'm in a better (not happy though) mood. this makes it harder to talk about the underlying issues. could this be a potential problem?

2) what do they typically ask you on the first appointment?

3) if i've been really narrow-minded and close-minded to a lot of people around me trying to tell me to think more positive and eat more, etc., is therapy really best for me? would therapy be helping me become less stubborn and more open-minded?

4) for those who have gone through therapy, was it relieving to finally have the official diagnosis?

5) again, for those who have gone through/are going through therapy, what's the biggest change you've seen in yourself? it can be good or bad.

Is this depression or something else? Really struggling.,"Hello everyone, just to preface my doctor has diagnosed me with depression, anxiety, and ocd.  Recently I have been filled with self hatred.

On my mind,"So after ages I finally asked my Crush (and one of my best friends) out on a date. And she said yes.This made me the fking happiest i've bin in forever. After 2 months of dating I realized that we were taking it very slowly. I thought it was fine, good things need their time to blossom.   
After another 2 months I realized that i was suffering under these circumstances and that it was really hard for me not knowing if she still liked me back. Yes we kissed and yes she initiated it once but two weeks ago this happened:

After one of the best nights i ever had, we were talking in the car and I just asked if everything was alright with ""us"". After a moment of silence I dreaded her answer and then she startet trying to say something. She tried and tried again and again until she finally said: "" I am in love with someone else... And the thing is it's not another male.""This has been really hard on me. I don't think she's a Lesbian but i, felt how insecure she was about her own sexuallity and that she was sooo afraid that people would not accept her anymore. Now i am stuck in a wierd af situation. I still really love her and I feel like giving up on ""us"" isn't even an option. She has been one of my best friend in ages and I dont want to loose her. But i dont know if its healthy for me if we keep on seeing each other or hanging out. I mean i've been kinda depressed for a while now, the bad feelings and thought come and go.

I'm also worried that if I distance myself from her that it would intensify her insecurites.

If she were in love with another guy i'd probalby stop seeing her tho, wouldn't I? Or at least I should, shouldn't I?

I told her that we have to talk and we are going to meet on Sunday. I just dont know what i want to tell her. That I love her? That we are done? That we are cool and that she should sort her stuff out?That she's a bitch for dating me for months with no intention of being in a relationship? I have pretty bad moodswings and don't know what I really feel.  
I just know that things can't stay the same as they are now.

My Depression,"  

The thoughts of a 30-year-old depressed guy. I am afraid of, well not afraid but the things I think about on a regular basis. I worry if my daughter will be taken away from because of my crazy ex-wife. I worry about what my daughter thinks or will think of me because I have no goals or ambitions right now other than to make enough money to outshine my ex-wife. I want to do all these things, but I am too worried about everything that will go wrong with them. I want to start a business and be successful, but I am afraid of failure and getting stuck right back where I am, which is like resetting my whole life. I worry about if I am going to get cancer because I am addicted to chewing tobacco and want to stop for my daughters sake because I don’t want it to influence her life because I have been told it is bad for you. I worry about being alone the rest of my life because I can’t seem to find anyone who loves me or is it because I am to shallow and don’t think anyone over 150 lbs. is pretty. I can’t sleep because my mind races and races at night and these things flow through my mind. I worry about looking successful to the people around me which holds me back because I don’t want to show how unsuccessful I am right now. I feel like a failure and a worthless person. the only thing that gets me through the really really tough thoughts is my daughter. And if I wasn’t here who would raise her. The pressure around me to do the right thing is tremendous but what is the right thing? Is the right thing what everyone thinks or what is socially acceptable? Is the right thing what I think is right? but then why do other people think some of the things I do are wrong? What makes them right? I think about the things in my past that I could have done differently but what’s the point? I can’t change them so why do I dwell on them? Do I need to even worry about them? I worry about how I am going to pay for things if I lose my VA disability but I don’t want to go to my VA appointments because I feel it reinforces the fact that I am messed up and I come up with excuses as to why I shouldn’t go. to try to reason with myself as to why its ok not to go. It’s also a distance away which wastes 2 hours of my days sitting at home doing nothing. So is it helpful to go to an appointment and lie to a doc for 15 mins telling him that every things ok and I take meds, Which I don’t take my meds because 1 I hate taking medication every day and 2 I don’t like to think taking them helps but they do because if I took them then I might not be writing this. I know I need to do better but I work at a dead-end job that has no future for me. I am just a pawn in someone else’s business story. I want to make more money, but I don’t know where to go because no one is telling me where to go and I am afraid to start anything just to fail. I don’t want to waste my time doing something and have that time taken from me by an unforeseen event. But why do I worry about an unforeseen event when I can’t even see it coming. Is my life that messed up that I am worried about something that may or may not happen. I sit here typing this looking into my baby monitor telling myself I need to do better for my daughter. What example am I setting for her if I don’t do anything with my life. I thought I had my whole life planned out then boom my world is rocked by an unhealthy relationship which everyone but me saw. Everyone told me I shouldn’t have been with that girl. Everyone told me I needed to leave her. But as cliché (why did I just look up how to spell cliché in something I am only going to read) as it sounds, I loved her. Or at least what I thought was love. I was ready to spend my life with her, but she went and fucked two other people and who knows how many others. But blamed me because she thought I had an affair…. Which I didn’t have an affair. I write this hoping my feelings will leave my body and I will not worry about them anymore. But for how long is it going to last? Is this really going to help? Maybe I’ll post this on some reddit website and become famous for it. Ha who am I kidding. I am nobody. I am a middle age man who has been handed a fucked-up life and can’t get out. But it’s not as fucked up as some people’s lives so why does mine hurt so bad? Maybe I am stuck on the materialistic things and want to hide behind them. Like having a nice truck but not as nice as the one I want because I am smart enough not to burry myself in debt and have that looming over me. I am content on doing nothing but am afraid of everything. I tell myself I am meant for more, but I don’t know how to get there. I am smart but not smart enough to figure out how to make myself happy. So, am I really that smart? I can tell you all night and day that I am smarter than what I am doing right now but have nothing to show for it. I think everyone is out to get me in some way shape or form, I don’t trust anyone, I think they all have some agenda to serve themselves but don’t we all. Is anyone truly selfless? Now I am just rambling to ramble so focus, focus on why I am writing this. Focus focus focus why why am I handed a dealt of cards that has no instructions? is that life? What’s the purpose? Why do I even waste my time? Why can’t I win the lottery and hide behind the money at least I will be able to do the things that make me happy because I won’t be constrained by money? But if I did have it would I really be HAPPY? I think it would be better than where I am. But why would I be so lucky as to win the lottery when there are stronger people out there who deserve it more than me? is luck a figment of our imaginations? are all the strings being pulled by some divine or supreme power? Some might say I am on drugs right now to think like this. I’m not. This is how my mind works and I think it’s a blessing and a curse. Who will even read this? Now it’s just becoming to long for the quick reader to think it’s interesting and too short for anyone to take it seriously but I’m not writing it for them I am writing it for myself. I want to get better I want to do better. But where are the answers? Do I make up the answers and hope I get by? Do I tell lies and belittle other people to get through life? Why not? It feels like other people, all people do it to me. Who is coming to punish those who do me wrong? Do I do it? No, why? because I am afraid of the consequences. I am pressured by everyone to do the right thing. Maybe that’s what governs people? Then why doesn’t everyone act the same? Are there to many questions in this? Who cares? Its mine right, maybe I will share this so someone can laugh, someone can feel empowered to do the same? Someone can belittle me? I need to do better I need to push myself to do better. I started working out because I thought I might get laid if I look better. But is anyone even going to notice? I wasn’t in shape before and got laid, sort of… I more or less have always found the girl who is in need and made her feel better, then when that wears off, I am alone… am I going to be alone for the rest of my life? At least I have my daughter, right? But eventually she will leave me too because no one wants to be around someone as depressed as me… I wouldn’t want to be around me. I always hear this saying on the radio or tv or what have you “ you have to love yourself before anyone can love you”… who am I kidding I will always be alone because I don’t see myself loving myself. I am fat, ugly and stupid. I don’t have any value. I don’t have the ability to love anyone else because I just want to use the other person to make myself feel better. But how is that? Does that even make sense? Am I connecting with anyone? If this is circulating around and you are reading this far, then possibly? Should I keep going? Maybe I still feel like going. My fingers are starting to hurt but it feels a little better to not have all these things bottled up inside me. Maybe it’s because I am pretending to type it to an imaginary audience. so, things I worry about. I worry about paying bills, but I am good at financial stuff. So that’s ok but I still worry about them. I worry that I am not doing the right thing. I worry about what other people think of me but that’s ridiculous. I should not worry about that right? I worry about the spelling in this, but I have spell check. I worry about sleeping all day when I have my daughter because she could hurt herself because she is 2. I also worry she is going to grow up and think I just slept all the time, but she doesn’t know I was up until 3am writing a stupid paper about the things I worry about. But that’s not her fault. I worry about making a good impression on the people around me because I don’t want to be alone and the only people around me is family right now. I seem to piss everyone else off. Why do I piss them off? Because I am pushing people away so they can’t hurt me. Is that an excuse? I worry about getting into an accident and not being able to take care of my responsibilities, but should I? I worry about being someone else’s burden, I don’t want to hinder someone else’s life with my inability to love myself. It is no one’s problem but my own. But there are people who want to help me or are they getting paid to do so because someone decided it was good for business to make money on others suffering. #cancer maybe that’s too much. I definitely can’t post this anywhere now. I worry about getting up in the morning and it being my last day. I worry that all of this will pile up and I’ll do something I can’t take back. But that’s why I think of my daughter, I worry I’ll be trapped in this life and these circumstances for a long time because I am too afraid to take a leap of faith and just try to make my life better. I worry about anything and everything. I don’t care about anyone other than my daughter truly, her life is the only real thing I care about. She is so innocent, am I contaminating her life by being in it though? Is my negative thinking rubbing off on her and will she be like me? I hope not. I see the negative in everything. I can’t think fast but when I do think at my own pace, I can figure shit out. I worry about being in a situation I can’t think my way out of. I truly worry about everything. My daughter is being pushed into school. Well I think so. Her mother doesn’t want her to not be in school, because she is ready. I think it’s because her mom doesn’t want to take care of her and wants to push her into school so someone else must deal with her. She seems too young to start preschool in my mind. Why do I care so much about what my ex-wife is doing or thinks? Maybe it is because I have to deal with her for the rest of my life, not like she is going away and I can’t not talk to her because then the court will see me as being unfit to parent then I will lose my daughter. I don’t want that now do I. I feel like my ex-wife has her life together and mine is falling apart underneath me but maybe she is just hiding it like I am trying to do? But I’m the one writing this so we will stick with my feelings. I don’t want to lose my daughter but everything I do I am feeling like it is a movement on a chess board and at any moment I am going to get check mated. Who even uses a term like that anymore? Apparently, I do. I worry about who is going to care for my daughter when I am not around. I worry she will fall into something and I can’t save her. Literally and figuratively. I worry my life is pointless then I think of her smile and watch videos of her, and it makes me happy. I worry I am a burden on people, and no one wants to deal with me, so I try to hide myself.

I isolate myself when I crave interaction.,"I feel pretty down every month or so, very down. I usually feel self hate and loneliness. I desperately crave feeling loved and cared about, and I have the urge to talk to people I'm close to, but all I end up doing is isolating myself, depriving myself of what I want, and then feel worse. It pushes people away.

Does anyone else isolate themselves and bottle up what they are feeling? Anyone know why I do it?

"I’m a pos, and you’re a pos too.","Perhaps I’m just playing the victim, but life has been pretty shitty lately and I’m spinning circles in my head. Am I the problem? Are all of the situations I find myself in, woven by me? Am I the diabolical monster weaving this fucking hell I’m stuck in? I’m so fucking tired of my brain coming to the conclusion that I am the victim. I’m tired. Some how it’s your fault that I’m codependent. It’s your fault that my choice in men has always been the worst. I mean, it has to be your fault that I married at 19, to the only person stupid enough to say yes. It has to be your fault that I’m four years into a relationship I feel has no escape. I’m drowning and I have the weight of an entire second person tugging at my feet. I fucking blinked and here I am. Years older but my brain feels like it hasn’t evolved in the slightest. Still easily disturbed and hurt. Still putting all my trust into one person just to be let down. Just to come to the harsh realization that they are human too, they make mistakes too. I know, I know… Everyone fucks up, but why does it feel like the world is ending when the people that mean the most to me fall short of my unrealistic expectations? Why do I feel ridiculously deceived? Surely I am their whole entire life, surely their world revolves around me. Why do I get stuck with these insecure, unsure thoughts rolling and crashing in my head. Surely it’s your fault, of course. I mean you were supposed to be the only man that never left. You were supposed to be the one that held me when I was let down. You were supposed to show me that I deserve more than what my taste lusts for. I’m sorry you never had that either. I’m sorry no one ever showed you right from wrong and I’m sorry no one held you when your heart was broken.

I’m so exhausted and scared,"Hey guys. Last week, i went through the roughest day that ocd has ever thrown at me, which pushed me to finally tell my mom that I was going through severe anxiety (OCD) and I didn’t know what to do anymore.

I can’t walk down the street without worrying about whether or not I knocked someone over without realizing it, or bumped someone into the road without realizing it, or worrying about a rabid animal biting me without realizing it and dying from rabies, or worrying about stepping on a needle infected with HIV, or worrying about a homeless person infecting me with HIV/something worse without me realizing it.

I can’t drive without worrying about whether I hit a pedestrian without realizing it on that right turn, or that left turn, or if that green light was really green or did I just run a red light and run over a pedestrian crossing without realizing it?

I can’t get near moving water without worrying about the brain eating amoeba. If I get splashed in the face, Ill freak out internally for the rest of the day. I can’t eat food without worrying about it being poisoned or worrying about tapeworms.

I can’t have a basic conversation without worrying about whether something I say will come back to haunt me

I KNOW these things are stupid and will probably never happen, but my brain keeps on throwing me the “what if?” and I won’t be able to move on. I’ll even get physically affected by my anxiety- my eyes will burn and it will get harder to breathe

Anyway, my mom set up an appointment for a psychiatrist (I’m 18 and I’m still not smart enough/have enough money to set one up myself, I feel worthless already, pls don’t remind me) and I went there today.

The guy seemed like a good guy and everything, and made me sign paperwork as I was talking to him and everything, and everything was cool. On the way out, my mom asked the guy how much the bill would be, and he said it would be around 300 dollars for the first visit and around 150 for every visit after that.

I’ve been so upset ever since. I feel so bad. I told my mom I didn’t feel good going to a psychiatrist if it would be that expensive, but she’s super super supportive and insists on me getting help (she goes through anxiety too, to a lesser extent).

Then, my brain got the idea that what if the papers the guy made me sign was really a contract that would come back to haunt me later (ex-what if I signed away part of my future income,etc.) it sounds so stupid and it is. My brain just sees everything as a threat and is stuck in a perpetual fight or flight mode

Anyway, I don’t know what to do. I feel Iike for the past eight months I’ve just been a drain on my parents and everyone around me. All I am is a burden that can’t even make myself happy. I feel like if I don’t go to anymore appointments with this psychiatrist, I’ll have thrown away 300 bucks of my mom’s money for no reason, but if I do go to another appointment with him, I’ll cost her 150 a pop. I feel like I’m taking advantage of people and I feel like I’m too stupid to get my act together. I just want to be able to be happy again and have peace of mind. I’ve watched myself literally go nuts and I don’t know what to do anymore. To add to it, this is all in my head. I can’t even tell reality from obsession anymore. This whole battle that I’ve fought for the last eight months is all in my head. I’m not doing anything productive by fighting OCD. I’m just wasting my time and I feel like ocd is just my excuse for being worthless.

I'm unemployed and I have no motivation to find a job,"I'm a 23 year old unemployed woman still living with my mom. I quit my job 3 months ago because of the stress and anxiety it was putting me through. Of late my mental health has worsened a lot and I can't seem to get out of the loop. Everything makes me cry and I don't even feel like going out of my room most days. I go to a psychiatrist and I am on meds but nothing seems to be working. (Ive changed almost 7 therapists/psychiatrists now because my mental health was showing no improvement.) I feel like a parasite, latching on to my mother and aunts for financial support. I want to move out and live independently but I don't even feel anything. I don't feel like doing anything, let alone wanting to work. I constantly worry whether I'm just being lazy and making excuses or whether I genuinely have a problem. I don't want to face people, give interviews or work among other people. Everytime I get a job I end up having panic attacks and excessively stressing out. The thought of having responsibility and knowing that there are certain expectations I have to meet while working, and the constant anxiety of doing badly at my job trouble me so much. I don't want to go through any of this. I don't want to. I don't want to do anything. I'm tired of being taunted by everyone and having to dodge questions about why I'm still unemployed.

The world is a big disappointment?,"Is it just me or does the world seem to be fucked ever since 2012. I wish the world ended in 2012 so I wouldn't have to deal with all the bullshit that I have been through. 

I'm currently in debt by like $25000, I work a full time job that is dependent on weather and the sea. My job pays well through winter but once summer hits I get paid fuck all. When I fall fully into a depressive/dilussional state of mind. My brain races at 100 miles an hour at all times, every little thing I over analyse. I have seen my only friend go through drug addiction and drug related psychosis. I have seen how life can shit all over you. 

My depression started at an early age because of bullying and lack of friends. Except the one in my life currently, you can't destroy our relationship. I feel like my depression really kicked in when I was around 15 or 16. My friend moved away to another city and I was left all alone. At the time bullying got worse and I made a few acquaintances but no real close friends. When I was 17 I dropped out of school and moved out of my family home. I started to have panic attacks in the shower and that was when I turned to drugs to numb the pain. Xanax was my go to for sedation as I could fight the effects somehow I loved that. Iv been a daily cannabis smoker for most of the time since I was 16 except the times I ran out and couldn't get anymore. I have done lots of psychedelics (u could call me a psychonaut) any sort of alternate reality really. Cannabis helps motivate me to stuff. 

I'm currently 19, still a virgin and struggling with financial situations. I  only just earn enough money every week to cover my bills so I never really buy anything for myself except weed. I can never seem to get ahead of my depression. It's like it just keeps dragging me down. When I'm really depressed I choose to sleep most of the day as sleeping is the only place where I can shut the fuck up. (I have lucid dreams all the time).

Venting....,"I don’t know where else to go.... I don’t know where else to vent. I’m scared of judgment. I feel like I’m just lonely and attention seeking. I feel like a waste of space. I don’t understand why my boyfriend could love me when I don’t even love myself. I keep a lot of mental health stuff away from him because I’m scared of how he will react. The first time I self harmed I showed my ex and he got angry at me. I wish I never dated that asshole. I wish I never existed. I better off dead but too scared to die. I wish I could manage to starve but I can’t even do thAt right. 269 pounds. Fat ass. I am a fat ass failure who could never get a job. Can’t even stick to trying to learn French. I wanna die but like I said I’m too scared to. I can’t just depend on my boyfriend to keep me happy that’s selfish. He has his own problems. I try my best to listen when he wants to let some feelings out.


Sometimes I feel like he just feels sorry for me.... sometimes I wonder if my friends really care..... if my family even cares.

I think my friends sometimes just think how annoying I am.

I swear I’m better off dead. I’m a burden.... nothing but a waste. 
Why am I here?
Why? 
I’m horrible at writing. Why do I try? I can’t draw for shit so I basically scribble and call it “art” 

I have tried so hard to become better at drawing.... I just can’t do it.

I try to have good and interesting stories.... they are shitty and predictable.

My OCs are all really bad Mary Sues.

Why did you read this? I just wasted your time.... I would think you have better things to do.

Coming to terms with the temporariness of it all.,"My mood fluctuations have not changed over the past year at all, despite me starting medication. However what I have noticed is that I'm able to contextualise thoughts and feelings a lot easier these days. For example I'm feeling fairly rubbish at the moment, but instead of the thoughts of loneliness and inadequacy I used to get with these feelings, I now just look forward to not feeling like this. It comes in waves and always has done, but I'm feeling it is affecting my productivity a lot less than it used to, obviously I'm more productive when I'm not feeling like this, but by Monday I probably won't feel like this.

I used to have thoughts of ending it, still do sometimes but I'm glad I didn't. I'm much happier now that I know it's not constant.

We take our victories when we can.,"This is my own personal experiences not a how too or trying in any way to say my life is worse or the way I cope will help anyone else.

It has been a long journey, a fight every day, sometimes we win sometimes we loose.

Looking back 22 years ago, I was never formerly diagnosed with ADHD or Bipolar type 2 effective disorder, was never diagnosed officially as on the higher function autistic spectrum that all came much later.

The umbrella term seemed to be Reactive Depression relating to not only my Fathers death when I was 12 but my Girlfriend/Wife being diagnosed with incurable cancer at 21.

I spent the following 20 years fighting along side my Wife against this horrible illness that slowly destroyed her body until 20th November 2018 a double cardiac arrest with me standing next to her telling the doctors to stop because I knew she wasn't coming back. (her heart was a 14% functionality due to a silent heart attack 13 days beforehand caused by damage done via medication to keep the cancer away which also caused diabetes and kidney failure).

7 days after she died I was diagnosed with Bowel Cancer and spent that Christmas in hospital having 40% of my bowels removed (I have nodules on my lungs they are keeping an eye on).

Being in the same hospital as Paola died 6 weeks beforehand plus certain pain medication caused hallucinations and the beginning of my diagnosis of PTSD.

No family because my mum by this time was in a care home in late stages of early onset dementia.

It felt like the universe was just hitting me with punch after punch just to see how many times I could stand back up.

6 months on no one visiting so outside contact, I was on suicide watch and Samaritans help line actually called me weekly to see if I was still around, I had a plan to end my life, my logic boiling down to the following two points.

If I end my life and that is the end then I am in no more pain.

If I end my life and there is something after I am with Paola.

Had a plan, even down to writing a script that would send out emails to my Doctor and Psychologist so professionals found my body not my neighbors, my dogs had a forever home setup and I was visiting all the forums and communities saying goodbye to all the games me and Wife had played.

I was in a very dark place and the only light was an oncoming train which was either ""cancer comes back"" or ""A life without my best friend)

Everything was black and grey, nothing felt real to me and even when they told me 73% chance my bowel cancer wasn't coming back I couldn't smile and be happy.

**What changed ?**

One of the last places that I was going to visit was the game The Division, it had many good memories of us both exploring, shooting out windows, messing around, I did a walk through saying goodbye to my wife, and as I logged off an advertisement for The Division 2 came up and I thought to myself, ""lets see what mess they have made"" ""No reason to keep my money if I am going to end things"" So I bought the most expensive pack, downloaded it and logged on.

Something amazing happened, the next morning I wanted to log back on, I hadn't gamed since Paola had died, I hadn't interacted, talked or blown anything up.

A few days later I wrote a reddit post on that forum thanking the developers for saving my life.

The response was amazing and people started saying why don't you go on youtube, on twitch, why don't you talk about your experiences, mental health, cancer, diabetes, dialysis, heart disease, why don't you tell the world about how gaming helped you.

My response was ""what have I got to loose"", I watched my wife die, could anything anyone said about me making a fool of myself online ever come close to this.

I bought a mic, I bought a webcam, I did cooking videos, vlogs, streaming and those victories really helped me go from day to day.

I never missed a day at least 1 video every single day went up on youtube and twitch.

I have close to 500 followers on Youtube, close to 1000 on Twitch, others follow me on Facebook, Reddit and Mixer, I now multi stream to all 4 main places.

Am I still broken yes, I am classed as severely disabled, some days It takes me coming down stairs 3 times for me remembering to brush my teeth or do laundry.

I spend a lot of time in VR Beat Saber, SkyrimVr and others, Valve sent me a Valve index with no strings attached, after reading one of my posts (both me and Paola were involved in VR since 2016 due to her disabilities it was wonderful).

VR is an amazing tool for fighting depression, the complete immersion of being within a game be it a horror, a rhythm game (I have no rhythm), or fantasy, can help switch your mind to a world where life makes more sense.

My Senior Psychologist and 2 of my specialists have signed off on me all feeling that Gaming, VR and my Vlogging actually have given me a level of existence and a place to be.

I still suffer from depression but this is how I cope, I still need post it notes on my walls to remember changing clothes, washing and shaving.",Quebber,0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/fedff4/we_take_our_victories_when_we_can/,personal experience trying way say life worse way cope help anyone else ha long journey

I Don’t Care About Living Anymore,"Over the past few months, my depression and social anxiety have spiraled out of control. At the end of my junior year of high school I had a really bad breakup and lost all my friends causing me to start self harming and isolating myself from everyone. Thankfully, this acquaintance I had took time out of his day to make music with me at lunch. It really meant a lot to me. He was the only friend I really had at the time. I had hung out with his friends a couple times before throughout high school, so I started playing video games with some of them. Eventually during the summer I got really close to them, and I became a part of their friend group. They really brought me out of that dark hole of depression, and I had never loved a group of friends more in my entire life. I had and still am going through extreme social anxiety, but helped me become more confident in myself and alleviated that a bunch. In the beginning of senior year I hung out with them after-school basically everyday, and it was the happiest I’d ever been. 

I don’t want to get into details but then something changed. A bunch of the group dynamics changed that made me felt inferior. I thought they thought I wasn’t as funny anymore, and was more weird and awkward. I reverted back to the state I was in with my previous girlfriend, and I started to worry incessantly that I would be abandoned by them. My mindset about the group also changed. I felt like I had to constantly meet their standards and entertain them or else they would abandon me. This has made socializing with them more of a grueling chore than a fun experience. I’ve isolated myself from them a lot, and I even feel a bit of anger towards them. 

There are these events that happen that make me feel like they think I’m weird, awkward, unfunny, and annoying, so I constantly try to change myself. I try to be less talkative, and apply a tight filter to what I say. I hate who I am. I can’t live with myself. I feel like everyone I interact with thinks I’m all of those things, and I can’t stand it. I hate everything about myself. My voice, the way I pronounce things, my mannerisms, my sense of humor, my conversations with people, everything. I can’t take it anymore.

Right now I’m on 50 mg Zoloft. Tonight I’m going to trip on 300 mg robotussin gels. There’s a possibility I could experience extreme even fatal side effects due to serotonin syndrome, but I don’t care anymore. I just want to be taken out of this reality for a while. It’s not even that I’m suicidal. I’m not trying to kill myself. But if that’s what ends up happening, I don’t care. I just don’t want to be here.",veelively,1,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/feddpq/i_dont_care_about_living_anymore/,past month depression social anxiety spiraled control end junior year high school really bad breakup lost friend causing start self harming isolating everyone thankfully acquaintance took time day make music lunch really meant lot wa friend really time hung friend couple time throughout high school started playing video game eventually summer got really close became part friend group really brought dark hole depression never loved group friend entire life still going extreme social anxiety helped become confident alleviated bunch beginning senior year hung school basically everyday wa happiest ever want get detail something changed bunch group dynamic changed made felt inferior thought thought funny anymore wa weird awkward reverted back state wa previous girlfriend started worry incessantly would abandoned mindset group also changed felt like constantly meet standard entertain else would abandon ha made socializing grueling chore fun experience isolated lot even feel bit anger towards event happen make feel like think weird awkward unfunny annoying constantly try change try le talkative apply tight filter say hate live feel like everyone interact think thing stand hate everything voice way pronounce thing mannerism sense humor conversation people everything take anymore right 50 mg zoloft tonight going trip 300 mg robotussin gel possibility could experience extreme even fatal side effect due serotonin syndrome care anymore want taken reality even suicidal trying kill end happening care want,care living anymore,vee lively,2633,33,vee lively past month depression social anxiety spiraled control end junior year high school really bad breakup lost friend causing start self harming isolating everyone thankfully acquaintance took time day make music lunch really meant lot wa friend really time hung friend couple time throughout high school started playing video game eventually summer got really close became part friend group really brought dark hole depression never loved group friend entire life still going extreme social anxiety helped become confident alleviated bunch beginning senior year hung school basically everyday wa happiest ever want get detail something changed bunch group dynamic changed made felt inferior thought thought funny anymore wa weird awkward reverted back state wa previous girlfriend started worry incessantly would abandoned mindset group also changed felt like constantly meet standard entertain else would abandon ha made socializing grueling chore fun experience isolated lot even feel bit anger towards event happen make feel like think weird awkward unfunny annoying constantly try change try le talkative apply tight filter say hate live feel like everyone interact think thing stand hate everything voice way pronounce thing mannerism sense humor conversation people everything take anymore right 50 mg zoloft tonight going trip 300 mg robotussin gel possibility could experience extreme even fatal side effect due serotonin syndrome care anymore want taken reality even suicidal trying kill end happening care want care living anymore
"My parents don't take my suicidal thoughts seriously, and my friends act like I'm invisible. I don't know what to do anymore.","Hi, I'm an eighth grader at a magnet school. I have ADD (attention deficit disorder), symptoms of depression, and I'm suicidal. For the past 3 years I've slowly been less and less motivated to do anything, even what I enjoy. I just want to go to sleep forever and forget about all the stress of school and a difficult social life. I get very stressed over school as the stakes go up, and my mom is constantly reminding me that I'll be a failure if I get too many B's. It doesn't help that my friends began ignoring me more and more when we started middle school with new, better people to hang out with than me. I'm treated like a tag-along now. My former best friends only talk to me and listen when they're bored and nobody else is there to talk to. I started having thoughts of suicide near the end of seventh grade, but it's really gotten worse this year as more is expected of me and my friends cast me further away. 
I decided to finally talk to someone this year, since my previous hints of needing help went unnoticed by my mom. On a day where I felt very low mentally, I told my mom I was suicidal. I broke down crying, and she hugged me. However, she said, ""Don't EVER even think about killing yourself. Do you know what that would do to me?"" I was a little upset about her reaction, as she seemed more concerned about herself. But I kept telling her more. I told her about how I thought I had depression, and she dismissed it as ""stress"" and said it would stop if i started to be positive. I was taken aback by this. I love my mother a lot, but she's never been good at giving advice or helping with my mental health. I got mad at her and began yelling about her never understanding or helping with my feelings. I was a little too extreme, but the anger was not irrational. She yelled back something about her trying to help with the grief counselor (1. She didn't help very much. 2. She was there to help us deal with grief over a family death, and she didn't help with my suicidalness). What made me feel worthless was when she yelled, ""What do you want me to do about it?"" and told her I wanted her there for me to talk to and she went on about my grades, what have I told you, learn to deal with your emotions better,  etc. I ran off crying to continue my homework. A few minutes later she came in with her phone and my dad was on a call. She had told him. She was mad about me not focusing on my homework and I needed to hurry it up and finish and stop crying. I kept crying, upset she didn't help, and a few minutes later my dad arrives. He was upset that I wasn't working on the project and ""wasting time"". I kept crying until he started yelling to stop crying. I stopped, tears welling in my eyes. I love my dad too, but he can't control his anger very well, and he follows his parent's ways of discipline, which is what he grew up with. As he lectured me I started clawing my arm to calm myself like I always do. He noticed me leaving scars on my arm and got angrier. He told me to stop and said this: ""Do you want me to do it for you?"" This really upset me, but I said nothing to avoid an argument. He got me to finish the project. He said he cared about me and loved me, and he left. No discussion of my mental state. My mom called him when i started crying later and he wasn't mad this time. He told me to go to sleep and feel better. I didn't feel better when I slept.
I just needed to get all that out.... I've been considering suicide a lot, and I know there's ""help everywhere"" like hotlines and such, but it won't help. I need people I care about to talk to. I lost my grandma in December of 2018 to cancer. She listened and cared. I have no one I know of now. My friends don't listen, and I feel like they think I talk about sad stuff too much. I just need to know what to do, because I honestly don't know anymore. The people I care about most can't help me, and I feel worthless. I never know what to talk about, and when i get to talk for once, my friends look at me different than they do at other friends. They look lost, bored, and like they want me to hurry up and get it over with. Then they go back to talking to the other people. I just need some advice... if you read this whole vent then you are an amazing person and I hope you have a wonderful

Drinking keeps me alive,It used to be something I did once every couple weeks at a party when I was a teen. Now it makes me happy. I love waking up still hungover with brain fog. It gives me this fuzzy feeling I used to feel with my SO. I know it’s terrible for me. I still work out but that only gives me an hour high. I’ve realized if I’m sober my thoughts consume me and when I’m drunk everything’s ok. My family and friends wonder how I do it but I guess I like the depressing hungover feeling.,rememberthememoriez,3,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/fe7ip2/drinking_keeps_me_alive/,used something every couple week party wa teen make happy love waking still hungover brain fog give fuzzy feeling used feel know terrible still work give hour high realized sober thought consume drunk everything ok family friend wonder guess like depressing hungover feeling,drinking keep alive,remember memo riez,474,23,remember memo riez used something every couple week party wa teen make happy love waking still hungover brain fog give fuzzy feeling used feel know terrible still work give hour high realized sober thought consume drunk everything ok family friend wonder guess like depressing hungover feeling drinking keep alive
Thinking about suicide more and more,"I am in a very dark place right now. I'm 32. I've been unemployed since last October after getting laid off (not due to performance, my whole team and 15% of my company got let go) and do not have a firm idea of what to do with my life. I have started to interview again over the past few weeks but they are mostly for the same type of work (which is pretty niche, not a ton of jobs available) and I just don't know if this is what I want to be doing for the rest of my life. In the meantime, I have been getting dicked around by recruiters and just feel like I'm getting left out to pasture even though I feel like I have a good background and interview well.  


Simultaneously, I am finishing up a part-time MBA program which I feel like has been a colossal waste of time, money, and energy. I honestly feel like I had better luck getting responses to job applications BEFORE starting my program. I have been slogging through my final semester, struggling to find the motivation to do my work. I finish in about 2 months, at which time I may or may not be employed again. I just don't know. It's extremely stressful. I will need to begin paying my college loans within 6 months of graduating and don't know how I am ever going to save for a down payment. I immensely regret going to business school.  


Add to this the fact that, for whatever reason, I seem to be getting ignored by just about every therapist I've reached out to for counseling. Maybe I need to start leaving messages that I'm thinking about ending it. I feel like I am losing my mind, and the only thing that keeps me feeling sane is my girlfriend, who without I'm not sure what I'd do. Unfortunately, she doesn't know about my compulsive  masturbation/porn addiction which seems to be consuming my life at the moment. I'm a \*\*\*\*ing mess and I don't know what to do.   


It's hard for me to think about actually killing myself, but I find myself thinking about it often. It gives me some sort of dark solace knowing that I could end it, donate everything I have (which isn't much) to some charity, and be remembered as more than a living nobody, which I feel like I am today.",spatula24,1,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/fe4hte/thinking_about_suicide_more_and_more/,dark place right 32 unemployed since last october getting laid due performance whole team 15 company got let go firm idea life started interview past week mostly type work pretty niche ton job available know want rest life meantime getting dicked around recruiter feel like getting left pasture even though feel like good background interview well simultaneously finishing part time mba program feel like ha colossal waste time money energy honestly feel like better luck getting response job application starting program slogging final semester struggling find motivation work finish 2 month time may may employed know extremely stressful need begin paying college loan within 6 month graduating know ever going save payment immensely regret going business school add fact whatever reason seem getting ignored every therapist reached counseling maybe need start leaving message thinking ending feel like losing mind thing keep feeling sane girlfriend without sure unfortunately know compulsive masturbation porn addiction seems consuming life moment ing mess know hard think actually killing find thinking often give sort dark solace knowing could end donate everything much charity remembered living nobody feel like today,thinking suicide,spatula 24,2152,36,spatula 24 dark place right 32 unemployed since last october getting laid due performance whole team 15 company got let go firm idea life started interview past week mostly type work pretty niche ton job available know want rest life meantime getting dicked around recruiter feel like getting left pasture even though feel like good background interview well simultaneously finishing part time mba program feel like ha colossal waste time money energy honestly feel like better luck getting response job application starting program slogging final semester struggling find motivation work finish 2 month time may may employed know extremely stressful need begin paying college loan within 6 month graduating know ever going save payment immensely regret going business school add fact whatever reason seem getting ignored every therapist reached counseling maybe need start leaving message thinking ending feel like losing mind thing keep feeling sane girlfriend without sure unfortunately know compulsive masturbation porn addiction seems consuming life moment ing mess know hard think actually killing find thinking often give sort dark solace knowing could end donate everything much charity remembered living nobody feel like today thinking suicide
I needed a mother,"You always hear how women fear they won’t love their child if it’s adopted which in most cases isn’t true. But in our case it seems to be true. Thank you for all the nice Christmas gifts you gave me. But you never gave the sense you cared about me. You were never there for me. I’m always getting blamed for things and It always feels like you just shrug me off. I never felt comfortable coming to you for advice and you never asked. Why is the connection between us nonexistent? You taught me about my period, you gave me a book that explained puberty. You never taught me about sex. You never ask if I have a boyfriend. You never ask me anything. You don’t really know me at all. I try to talk to you and you seem annoyed when I do. I come to you for guidance about what I should major in and you just judge me for not being able to make up my mind. You’re always petty when I give you attitude but you don’t ask why. I’ve been depressed since I was 12 years old and you never noticed. You never helped me with school and hated that I wanted my license and I’m trying to get my citizenship and you couldn’t care less that I’m not one. When I didn’t have health insurance you didn’t care. When I wanted braces you never helped me until I finally became old enough to do it myself. I don’t have anyone to tell my secrets to. I don’t have anyone to guide me and I feel bad because you’re always alone but it doesn’t seem like you care and want me near you. You get offended Everytime I hang out with dad but never want to do anything with me. I don’t know if you think you’re a good parent but you’re not familiar to me. I just want a mother.

Am I weak or do I not have a choice?,"Why can’t I do what I need to do? I remember telling my final therapist how I’d sit paralyzed while my mind screamed at me to do things, and she said I just had to do them. 

It was one of those things I’ve been told that stings to this very day. Is this paralysis some internal weakness that I do have control over? If so, how the hell does this work because I can’t figure it out?

I wouldn’t have gone to see someone if I’d have known they’d told me what they did. I came to them for help. Was what they gave me the only help there is? Is this my fault?

Divorced parents,"Hey can any of you all relate to this? I’m 22 year old male . My Parents divorced when I was 13. While they were married, my siblings and I witnessed verbal abuse, threats, dad pushed our mom, mom crying, dad coming home drunk, and even after the divorce they constantly talked bad about each other . Since the divorce, I became really sad and it follows me until this day. Some days I’m happy and then there are days where I cry myself to bed. The day they divorced, police had to come to the house because my dad was trying to hurt my mom. Soon after I witnessed my younger brother change from an innocent child to a drug addict. My father was an alcoholic who is now dead. My mother had the nerve to say to me “I don’t why your brother is like this... he didn’t have it that bad.” My mom really doesn’t know the trauma she caused me and my brother. My brother was vulnerable. He needed someone but I was too young to realize he needed help. Not until now . I was gone In the military when he spiraled out of control.

"Everytime I think I'm finally doing well, for even a second, something else happens which fucks me over.","I just feel like something put there is telling me to kill myself. It just keeps throwing shit out me till I give up. I think I can finally take a breather. And then theres something else to stress about. This time, I was about to be late on rent. But I did all I could to get the money together. (I'm not even gonna say all the things I did to get the money) but then. I just got off work. And I was about to swing by the bank to withdraw the money to lay rent. But then my car wouldn't start. And I'm completely alone in this state. So I had to call someone to come out and jump me. But it wouldn't jump. So I had to spend money to get it towed. Then the damn mechanic shop jerked me around, and ended up fighting with them alot ( I use to be a mechanic so I know when I'm getting jerked around) but they were so incompetent, that it took them 6 hours to basically figure out that the battery needed to be replaced and then do it. They lied to me when they told me the tested the battery when they first pulled it in the bay. They put a new starter on, without telling me until after the fact. And then told me my engine was seized up due to there being 0 oil in it. Which I dont know if I believe, because I just got my oil changed about a week and a half ago. And I know I dont have a leak. So either they were lying or the technician at the luge shop didnt put oil back in my car. But anyway, long story short. They forced me to pay 600$ for basically a battery change. And then I had to go back to work 2 hours later, with no sleep since my last shift. So that was great. But that 600$ was going to be for my rent. No I dont have any money. And I'm not sure what I'm going to do.

I hate the way I look,"Nowadays people are starting to embrace body positivity and are learning to love who they are. So why can’t I? Every time I look in the mirror all I see are flaws. My stomach bulges out too much, my face is fat, my acne is ugly, I need to shave, my teeth are yellow, my butt’s too small, etc. Why can’t I see the good in myself?

My biggest insecurity is my stomach. I can’t help to think that I’m fat even though I have an average BMI at 5’5” , 140 with playing a sport/working out every day.  I think this insecurity sort of stems from everyone around me being stick thin. This one girl in my grade keeps saying how “fat” she is when she’s half a foot taller than me and weighs less. I know that shouldn’t bother me but it does. I also am a gymnast and seeing everyone around me be thin and look good in leotards makes me feel awful.

After eating a lot, I can’t help but be so mad at myself later for putting on so much weight, but sometimes I just can’t help it. I like food. It’s gotten to a point where my lunch is just a granola bar and I’m just hungry throughout my day.

If anyone has any tips to help raise my self esteem it’ll be greatly appreciated but honestly no ones probably going to see this. If you’re reading this, thanks random reddit user for listening to my rant. You’re breathtaking.

It drives you to do things you'll never forgive yourself for,"I remember the past few weeks were the ones in the summer where I wasn't able to see you much. I felt so sick, not because I couldnt see you, but because I knew I would. The fact that everytime I seen you, you acted as if you loved me so much. Why did you? I never understood and I couldnt comprehend. I didnt believe you the slightest. And even the day I broke it off with you for the first time, I didnt understand why you seemed to be on the verge of crying. I didn't even say it out loud that I thought we weren't going to last, you just read me like a book. Whenever you read me, did i seem pathetic? All I felt was numb. My heartless self watched you walk away, and the last feeling id feel for a long time walked away too. I wish I could tell you about it all. I loved you so much. I tell these lies, apologizing how I didnt appreciate you enough then, telling lies to my friends about how I really felt. My only desire was to die, the quickest way to get it done was to get rid of you. In the end, I didnt die, but at the same time I did. I didn't even have enough energy to tie a knot or swallow any meds, it even felt so heavy to blink. Im horrible for acting like i hated you after, you acted like you hated me. I dont blame you for it, for me it was just a way to not let my pride down. We grew back together, we were so close. It got to the point we felt for eachother again. But I didnt understand why I was still fucking numb. I didnt want to be with you, I wasnt ready. I wanted to die. Everytime I almost did it, id somehow end up back where I started. I hurt you so much. Somehow, some way, we got through it. You never found out how I really felt. We made it. Im better. I love you so much. Everyday I'm wallowing in self hatred, because of the pain I caused you. Yet you had believed you were in the wrong? I don't understand that, i never will. You're always in my mind. I want to die, but I push through it for you. So I can see you once again every day.

I can’t believe I’ve gotten this bad,"I understand losing a job. Losing your mom. Getting cheated on and finding out about it in the most cliche possible way. Losing hope in everything. I was so self destructive before and after. Just wanted to not feel. Way before any of this shit started to happen. It’s difficult accepting and understanding what’s happened in the past has effectively shaped you in a negative and positive way. But most of us stop there. I’m stopped there. The negative way, it’s so easy to get caught in that loop. We can be right about some things but it doesn’t change anything. I say I can’t believe I’ve gotten this bad for good. I won’t bore anyone with details of my childhood as we all have a few nights worth of stories. Just know you always have a decision and it’s yours. Right now it’s pretty hard at 25 years old I’ve let myself be manipulated by my own father and my ex. I remember at a younger age feeling like I don’t deserve to feel sad and I shouldn’t. Now I think it’s just a plain joke and I’m being tested. Not religious or whatever didn’t mean that but fuck, life is getting a little too real. I just got a letter from my school they approved a grade change appeal. I just stopped showing up. For 2 semesters. I have my suspicion due to the community I’m from and the major/degree I was going in for they are tight knit and had my back(if you’re from this community you will probably know). When I received the letter my first response was anger that they would let someone like me back. But it’s time to be done with all my self searching. For so long I would be thinking what could I change/tweak about me to make more people like me. What can I change to make me think that I don’t care about what people think even though that was on my mind 99% of the time and stressing me out. I’ve been stuck in the past and it’s time to move on. It’s unfortunate that for so many of us we know something is wrong and we want to change. So many of us don’t know how. I still don’t know how. But I’m going to fucking start. I’m starting here. My next step is doing less things that don’t get me anywhere and more thing that move me forward.

Depression or laziness?,"For quite a long time now, I've been restless, not enjoying life at all(anhedonia), and lacking any sort of motivation to do anything at all. For a while I thought I was lazy, but I'm quite a rational person, and even when I've made full sense of why I should get up and do a thing, I recede into doing nothing again. I just don't seem to care enough about anything, nothing seems to be worth my effort. I have no passions or liking to things, I just sit there on my computer all day/TV. 

Most days I see no reason to get up or do anything healthy/productive. It's quite a nihilistic out view I have. I must say, I'm quite optimistic. As contradictory as that sounds I always look on the bright side of things, as it always bodes a better result.

Am I extremely lazy or depressed? I sure feel down most of the time, when I'm with friends it's okay, but it's not like any of my laughs or smiles are genuine however; I feel emotionless most of the time.

I don't want to die but I don't want to exist anymore,"yeah. everything freaking sucks. I'm on spring break and can't go anywhere at all (literally locked in my house all day) because my dad has refused to fix my car and won't let me pay to get it fixed, but then also won't let me use his car because he hasn't given himself enough time to change his breaks. I'm 21 and tired of asking for a ride like I'm 15 again. I feel worthless because I suck at school (I'm in PA school and am struggling in 2 classes) and I won't get any of the scholarships I even apply to because I'm a white female whose dad and stepmother both have great jobs (though we're still not great financially because of shit my biological mother caused), and my GPA isn't good enough. and my professors won't write me a recommendation because I suck at school and iv only known them for about 5 weeks. so now idk if I can even pay for the rest of my school. I can't work during PA school because my days are 15 hours long including class and nonstop studying. I am never going to be good at anything. I have endometriosis and my surgery was supposed to be during the 3 weeks chunk I have off between spring and summer semesters but now I can't because they're booked so I have to spend 9 more months being in pain. I can't go anywhere, I'm trapped here with my own thoughts. I hate my family situation because my dad is rude and critical, my stepmom is a bitch, and my mom ruined my family. there is literally no point to living because I can't ever have anything I want nor is my life fair in the slightest. fuck it all I want to die but I don't. I just don't want to deal with anything anymore. I wish I was never born because god obviously just fucking wants to make my life so damn hard and at this point I feel as though I was set up to be depressed.

Venting a bit,"I realized recently that I might have bipolar disorder based on a couple of friends I know who have it and also the symptom checklists that I have looked at. I have been diagnosed with general anxiety as depression but lately it’s felt more than that, particularly in the swings between extreme optimism and sociability, and pessimism’s day depression. 

Anyways I was looking online and found an online counseling website. One of the boxes you have to fill out is info that the counselor will look over in order to have a better understanding upfront. As I was filling it out I poured my heart into it and explained my feelings better than I ever had to anyone before, even myself. I was feeling like there was hope in figuring out what the fucks going on in my head. Then I hit the “next page” button and it brought me to the payment section.

Never did the website mention that it was a paid thing up until this page. I understand that it’s a business and the counselors have to get paid somehow in order to not do a completely shit job, but the fact that they didn’t mention that until you’ve already broken yourself down and opened up really pissed me off. It felt like they were saying, “okay what’s going on, what’s wrong? Oh no that’s unfortunate, now before I give you any help for all of the super personal stuff you just opened up to me about, I’m gonna need your credit card info. Oh you can’t afford it, well fuck off then.” 

It’s 3:23 am where I live and I feel completely stuck. I am a college student working two jobs just trying to make ends meet while also juggling the exhausting unpredictable bullshit in my head everyday, and the fact that I have to pay for help with something I didn’t ask for and wouldn’t wish on my worst enemy kind of astounds me at the moment. I don’t know where I’d be if I had visited the site without the semi level head that I have right now and had been hit with that price tag for my well being.

I feel like my life's not gonna get any better,"I post here and never get any responses but whatever.

I'm going to be turning 20 this year and waking up every morning is getting harder. I feel so lost and like I have no direction. I took a mental health day off from work and all it did was show me how much I don't do. I feel like I have no hobbies, I try play games but I lose interest after 5 minutes, I try work on Writing or Drawing and I lose any motivation almost instantly. The only way I can get any satisfaction is masturbation and afterwards I always feel disgusted with myself. I've tried going to school 2 times now and had to drop out halfway through the semester both times.

Can I say I have a mental health condition to an employer even if I haven't been diagnosed?,"Hello I am certain that I have been suffering from anxiety and depression for a number of years. As a result I completely withdrawn myself from society but the end of last year it was time for me to get a job, try and put myself back out there and hopefully make myself live bit more comfortably, and maybe give myself a chance of recovering life in my late 20s. I also believe I have dypraxia as I have difficulty talking to people in certain situations but I have complete fluency in others.

However, having got this job I'm experiencing a number of things of which I have experienced in every role since I have been working and that is people are quick to jump to conclusions, and this isn't me being paranoid. This is an accumulation of experiences that are similar for me and I know what will happen in a few months I'll be the most hated person at that job and everyday I go, they will most likely give me hell.

Can I say I have a mental health condition to my employer if I haven't been diagnosed? I don't really want them to personally attack me every time I enter a new workplace because I would like a chance of living too. Why are people so quick to assess one another then give them hell because one person front talk properly? 

I really needed a job which is why I never said anything about a mental health condition as I believe this would have almost certainly affected my chances. 

What should I do? Because if I don't do anything then I know what will happen during this adventure of employment, I will have to leave because of comments and accusations that aren't true. Something doesn't seem right there. Also, I know there is something wrong because hardly want to talk to anyone nowadays. I have no friends out of choice as an example. I dreamt of working very insular jobs growing up. Well may as well kill myself because no one can help they can give me placebos but they won't give me the one thing which will cure depression and other mental illnesses in an instant but they can't give me the job I wanted to do with my life so tell me what is the point?

Knowing that people cared about me made me want to kill myself even more.,"A month ago I was feeling suicidal. During that period I had a conversation with my son's 16 year old cousin from his mom's side of the family. During our conversation he mentioned to me how much he cares and looks up to me and how I was the only adult he could talk to about girls, his problems, and guitars (shit all teenage boys like to talk about). After our conversation I started thinking about what he said and about all the people in my life that care/depend on me (my son, parents, friends, etc.). And for some reason it seemed like more of a reason to kill myself. I found comfort in knowing that if I killed myself I would be missed. I knew they would be sad for awhile but eventually they would move on and think about all the good times we had. I liked knowing that despite my decision I would die knowing I had an impact on someones life.

Has anyone else felt that way?

Literally Careless.,"I’ve been depressed since my last year of school so for 5 years now and nothing seems to make me happy. I’m convinced that life just isn’t for me. Recently I’ve lost everything I’ve got no job no money, I pushed all my friends away and pushed away a girl who loved me and would do anything for me. I block all my problems out and just isolate myself. I don’t open up to anyone I just say I’m fine. It’s gotten to the point where I don’t care about anything anymore. Whatever happens I just don’t care nothing bothers me or phases me I’ve been so unhappy for so long and no one even knows what goes on in my mind. I feel like it’s never ending. Most of the time I don’t want to live. I never tell anyone anything because I feel so embarrassed and people might not believe me but I’ve hid all this for so long...

Memories,"Do you ever just stare up at the roof of your house/apartment and wish you lived in an old rustic cabin in the wood? Having the ability to stare up at the old logs and beams instead of the flat surfaces in modern ones.

I do. I keep dreaming about my gradfathers cottage on the lake and I smile. Then I remember how my life really is and it all comes crashing down.

I am not okay,"Coping is no longer working. I'm not actively suicidal, but passive. I'm peeling my fingers bloody. Chewing my lip bloody. I want to shave my head. The last time I did that I was 21 and in serious need of mental health help. Or a hug. Who knows. I have chronic pain that is awful the last few years, relationship problems that he won't work out with me because he chooses to be stubborn and stand offish. 


I don't know how much more of life I can handle without cracking and shattering. It's been mostly abuse and loneliness with a few brief happy moments. I've inherited every crazy gene in the family on top of that. I don't know how much I can take. So I want to shave my head because that will help.. somehow, I don't know. 


I'm just struggling in general. I don't know how to cope anymore. Journaling helps for a few minutes. Crafting helps for a few minutes. Standing in the sun helps for a few minutes. I don't know how else to feel better because nothing feels better for long.

I'm such a loser,"I am so fucking lonely. I wish I had a significant other or a friend to tell me everything is going to be ok, that I don't need to give up and kill myself. That I don't need to worry so much about my future.. I just crave attention. The lack of human contact is depressing. At least I have a family, but will I just live with my mom forever? without ever having my own house, my own money, my own life?

Everything seems so uninteresting and boring. I'm just so tired of having no motivation to chase my goals. I feel like I once I had the potencial to have a good life, but somewhere on the way I lost my purpose. I'm still young but I feel like I've missed out on so much already.

I hate myself. I hate my inability to live a normal life.

Guess I'll just listen to sad music, drink alcohol, masturbate to porn, and cry myself to sleep tonight like every other day. At least I get to feel something. My mind is so broken, I'm just a piece of trash, a sad excuse for a human being.

I'm a talentless loser. Even If I wanted, I couldn't be succesful in any career or job. I'm too slow, too dumb.

This sub is nice to chat with other people in a similiar situation, but it's also just an illusion. It's not like anyone here cares about me either. Every single day I think about comitting suicide and I really feel like I'll do it in the next few days. In a way I feel kinda guilty for having those thoughts cause I really think this earth is amazing, I hate myself for wasting my life like that but I think it's the only way i'll feel at peace with myself, though I admit i'm scared of death, I'm scared of the emptiness that will come after. but I'm also scared of the emptiness I feel now, while I'm still breathing yet unable to feel true joy and enjoy it to the fullest. I guess 2019 is my last year. I'm crying as I type this, I just wish things were different, I wish I was much more than I am now. I rarely leave the house but when I do I always feel a bit sadder when I see a couple together or just a group of friends having fun. I know I'm too awkward and weird to live life like they do. I know it's pathetic, but it's just the way it is. And obviously I have big self steem issues and hate the way I look. Every time I look in the mirror I think of how ugly and disgusting I am, I actually try to avoid looking because I know I'll get depressed(more than I usually am on a regular day). I keep writing these posts on reddit because it's better to share the way I'm feeling than just rot in my room, maybe I can find some cool person to chat with and make my existence a bit less miserable? who knows. I really feel sorry for my parents, cause they have no idea how I really feel, and I just can't picture myself saying all this to them. I wish I could kill myself without making my family suffer. They don't need to just because I'm a piece of shit loser

I know there’s something wrong with me and I hate that I can’t figure out why,"I feel like my life is spiraling out of control and I have no idea why and I hate it so much. Nothing ever seems to go right for me and I’m stuck in this stupid rut and I’m so fucking tired of it. My life is one long loop and I feel like there’s no purpose to any of it and I honestly just want it to be over because I have no idea what to do. I don’t have the energy to do anything I love anymore and nothing makes me happy because even if it’s going well I know that it’s just on the surface and deep down I still wish I was dead. I worthless, like I just take up space and I don’t deserve to get help. My little sister started going to therapy last year after my parents found out she was harming herself but I can’t even count the amount of times I’ve sat on the floor sobbing to my mom about how I can’t take being alive anymore and no one has done anything to try to help me. I’m begging for someone to help because I feel like no one cares. 

The worst part is being tired. I’m so fucking sick of being exhausted no matter what I do. I’m always in a fog no matter how much sleep I get and I can’t focus or think. My head always hurts. I feel like my body is shutting down. I don’t have an appetite and I lost about 20 lbs since the summer. I gained some back and started hating the way I look so that’s going for me too now. Now I don’t eat because 1. it makes me feel sick 2. I hate the way I look 3. I know it’ll hurt me. I’m fucking sick of all of it. 

For my entire life, I’m supposed to have been perfect. I can’t admit any of this to anyone because I’m so scared of being pitied or being vulnerable. My grades are slipping and I don’t know how to deal with it because my entire life is being a perfect student who’s going to get into a perfect college and if I can’t do that I’m fucking worthless and I should just be dead. On top of all that I think I might be a lesbian, and that is one of the things I hate most about myself, more than my body or personality or grades or anything else. 

I think about killing myself every single day but I’m too scared to do it. I have a plan and I have a suicide note written down just in case so it’s ready if I decide to ever do it. I don’t even want to die. I just want all of this garbage to be over. I’m 17 and I feel like I’m not going to make it another year if things keep going the way they are and I’m honestly scared. I just wish I was never born so that I wouldn’t even have to go through killing myself and that way no one would be hurt if I was dead. If I die I don’t have to apply to college or come out or worry about failing any more or eat or hate the way I look or hurt myself or anything because it would all just be over and I wouldn’t have to deal with any of this shit.  I’m so fucking tired of all of it. I can’t even think of a legit reason why I feel this way and that’s what I hate most of all. Everything is going wrong and there’s no tangible reason why and that makes me want to panic. I’m so frustrated and I have no outlet for any of it and I don’t even feel like a human any more. My whole life is barely keeping my head above water in school, coming home and chugging green tea so I don’t eat, and wanting to kill myself when something small goes wrong. I just want it to be over.

Secretariat was right,"I'm rewatching Bojack Horseman on Netflix for the umpteenth time because that's the only thing I do that I enjoy anymore. 

I've recently noticed that in the show Secretariat is right, that you should never stop ruining, never look back, all that you have is what's ahead. That's what I've been doing and it seems to be working as long as I don't stop. 

My last relationship almost killed me, my ex was abusive. Before her I survived since shit, sexual assaults and the like. I've done terrible things too, things for survival, some things simply because I was a bastard.

Now i keep myself busy. I work 50+ hrs and volunteer  for the entire weekend. I have pets that need constant attention, and I'm constantly moving. When I'm not running around I always have a drink in hand. It works. The only time I look back is when I'm falling asleep,  that's the worst. That's when I can't escape it. Thankfully sleep cones soon. But I need to keep moving. If I stop I'll be consumed. Im terrified of that. I can't handle that. I can't relive it, I just can't. 

I don't know what to do anymore. I come from a long line of alcoholics and I'm fast on my way to join them. I'm so tired but I can't risk showing down. I just wish it would end but I'm too scared to do anything about it. I'm ruining as fast and as hard as I can but I'm slowing down and it's catching up.

I hate myself MASSIVELY.,"Okay, here it goes. I don’t really care if this isn’t a throwaway account, it’s whatever.

During the beginning of my teenage years, (13) I didn’t care about anything, how i looked, or anything of that sort. Looking in mirrors was fine, and life was good.

When i hit 14 i sent a really horrible selfie of myself to a group of online friends, was bullied really bad for it, and so on. From then on i’ve been incredibly alert of myself, if you know what i mean. 

I stayed with this friend group because they were the only people i knew and could talk to, my parents hated me for being gay, and my brothers only took in their footsteps. After this, i just completely broke down, got so insecure that i wore a jacket for a year because i was so scared of anyone seeing me. That ended when i was 14. 

I stopped because i just decided to stop feeling sorry for myself and that i was the only problem in that situation. Since then, it’s only gotten worse. I now spend all time i can get in my room, under a blanket, won’t call anyone because i don’t want anyone to hear how bad i sound, don’t let anyone see me because of how bad i look, etc. 

I’ve attempted suicide once, and that one time my dad walked in on me trying to hang myself. I’ve given it lots of thought since then, and honestly, every day it feels like a better option.

I don’t know why i’m posting this, something in me told me to post this here.

I’ve lost the first battle,"I used to bottle things up. Hope they would just pass without causing any problems... they usually would and because of that I thought it would be a good way to deal with stress and all of that. I was wrong. Ever since I tried being more and meeting more people and making my life more exciting it just hasn’t worked. If anything it made things worse. Stuff just keeps getting added to my bottle and now the cap doesn’t even fit on the top. It’s affecting the people I’m around and I don’t like it but I also don’t want to tell them what is wrong because I don’t want them to worry or be concerned. My feelings are leaking and I don’t like it because they are noticing. I feel like I’m doing more harm to them by not telling them. I just want everyone to be ok but I don’t want them to know...suicide has been a very present thought in my head but I don’t want to leave...it would just hurt them more..hopefully my thoughts on that won’t change or else I won’t be here for long...

Today I hate myself more than I usually do,"I did something stupid. 

I only talk to one person about my mental health. She is the only person who has ever helped me not be depressed. After being depressed and okay-ish at my best for about a decade, talking to her made me feel happy. And it wasn't just for a minute, an hour, or a day. I felt happy for about half a year. 

That was what led me to tell her. I wanted to thank her, and I couldn't say thank you without telling her why. When I told her about my mental health, she was supportive. Even though I haven't felt happy in about five months, I still look forward to talking to her.

But today I did something stupid. I started an argument over something that so trivial that one noticed it. Usually when I am speaking to anyone, I try to think about what I say before I say it, because I would hate to say anything that bothers people, but not today. Today, I when I was with her, I didn't once stop to think about what I was saying. If it came to mind, I said it. 

I didn't think she was bothered until she told tried to tell me something like ""I spend my whole life making sure I don't... Isn't it ironic that that I end up doing that?"" As she said that, I saw her face get red and ber eyes start to tear up a little. And I realized that I was being a fucking asshole. 

She has never asked me to do anything. Not a single time. She has helped me when I am having suicidal thought. She has helped me when I feel like I am about to have a mental breakdown. She has helped me through a lot. And I just go and return the favor by being the worst person to her.

I have been trying to distance myself from her, because in the past couple of months, life just hasn't felt like its for me. I don't think that I should ever feel better. Depression is exactly what I deserve. Everytime I have caught myself feeling a little better, I just tell myself what I have to feel like shit again. Now, I will find it easier to no longer talk to her. As much as I looked forward to talking to her, I look forward to her forgetting me.

There isn't a whole lot keeping me from having the thought that makes me take my last, she is one of the two things that even just thinking of her helps me keep the suicidal thoughts just thoughts. I think she still wants to talk, and I know I will see her for at least the next 2 months, but when those 2 months are up. I won't talk to her, and I will do everything that I can to keep me from ever talking to her again. I don't want to make her sad or ever make her cry again.

Right now, I know I probably won't gather up the courage to end it, because I still have to see her. But I did resently take up self harm. I started by hitting my upper thigh, so no one would see the marks. Recently, I started growing out my hair, so that no one will notice that I started hitting my head. A while after I see her for my last time, the odds that I'll finally do it will rise.

I fucking hate that I possibly made someone feel anywhere near how if feel most of the time. I hate myself even more for doing it to the only person I have ever felt safe enough to tell everything about anything.",IH8MyThoughtsAtTimes,0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/fe9mia/today_i_hate_myself_more_than_i_usually_do/,something stupid talk one person mental health person ha ever helped depressed depressed okay ish best decade talking made feel happy minute hour day felt happy half year wa led tell wanted thank say thank without telling told mental health wa supportive even though felt happy five month still look forward talking today something stupid started argument something trivial one noticed usually speaking anyone try think say say would hate say anything bother people today today wa stop think wa saying came mind said think wa bothered told tried tell something like spend whole life making sure ironic end said saw face get red ber eye start tear little realized wa fucking asshole ha never asked anything single time ha helped suicidal thought ha helped feel like mental breakdown ha helped lot go return favor worst person trying distance past couple month life felt like think ever feel better depression exactly deserve everytime caught feeling little better tell feel like shit find easier longer talk much looked forward talking look forward forgetting whole lot keeping thought make take last one two thing even thinking help keep suicidal thought thought think still want talk know see least next 2 month 2 month talk everything keep ever talking want make sad ever make cry right know probably gather courage end still see resently take self harm started hitting upper thigh one would see mark recently started growing hair one notice started hitting head see last time odds finally rise fucking hate possibly made someone feel anywhere near feel time hate even person ever felt safe enough tell everything anything,today hate usually,ih 8 thought time,3121,42,ih 8 thought time something stupid talk one person mental health person ha ever helped depressed depressed okay ish best decade talking made feel happy minute hour day felt happy half year wa led tell wanted thank say thank without telling told mental health wa supportive even though felt happy five month still look forward talking today something stupid started argument something trivial one noticed usually speaking anyone try think say say would hate say anything bother people today today wa stop think wa saying came mind said think wa bothered told tried tell something like spend whole life making sure ironic end said saw face get red ber eye start tear little realized wa fucking asshole ha never asked anything single time ha helped suicidal thought ha helped feel like mental breakdown ha helped lot go return favor worst person trying distance past couple month life felt like think ever feel better depression exactly deserve everytime caught feeling little better tell feel like shit find easier longer talk much looked forward talking look forward forgetting whole lot keeping thought make take last one two thing even thinking help keep suicidal thought thought think still want talk know see least next 2 month 2 month talk everything keep ever talking want make sad ever make cry right know probably gather courage end still see resently take self harm started hitting upper thigh one would see mark recently started growing hair one notice started hitting head see last time odds finally rise fucking hate possibly made someone feel anywhere near feel time hate even person ever felt safe enough tell everything anything today hate usually

I kinda need advice?,"So these past few months my mental health has been getting worse and I don’t know if it’s because of these two friends I have, because I don’t want to put all the blame on them. So I met one of them at the beginning of the school year and the other one I’ve known for a while but we never really talked and they were really nice to me and we had lots of fun hanging out after school since we were on the same bus. But as time went on they kinda got mean? One of them would sometimes slap me or punch me in the stomach but when I would stand up for myself they would be like I’m over reacting or something. The other one just confuses me since one day she would be praising me saying “you’re so smart” “ how are you so good at everything” then the next day she’ll be like “ you’re so fucking dumb you’re and idiot” “aren’t you smart so like you’re supposed to know that” “don’t you even know fucking anything” just to make it clear I never really liked having those types of compliments since it made me uncomfortable since it’s like what if I all of a sudden don’t meet their expectations or something. I feel like my “problem” is just me overreacting but I’ve been trying to distance myself but on the bus while they’re next to me I can hear them talking shit about me. I keep to myself around them I don’t talk to them but they still talk to me asking why are you ignoring us.

I haven't had a best friend in years,"A few years ago I had a solid group of friends I would hang out with pretty much every weekend. I felt like we could tell each other anything, like out souls were connected. But little by little, they began to drift away. Their social media now filled with photos of people I didn't know with captions all about their 'bestie' or 'sister' or 'wifey'. That used to be me. I ask everyone to hang out, even try reconnecting with old friends, every time I either get ghosted or a simple 'omg I miss u too! I'm just so busy rn but we should totally hang!' with no follow up. I'm alone. Every weekend i sit at home with my cat and watch Netflix. I can feel the stress building up on my shoulders with no relief in sight.

What depression feels like,"I can’t put it into words all the time but depression to me feels like I go through life with this tight tight pressure just squeezing on my heart all day long and I just have to ignore it and go throughout my day with nobody knowing what’s going on. But when I snap and I cry it’s because the pressure has just built up too much and I just can’t handle it anymore but I only snap in private because once you cry and once those emotions are out of your system and you have momentary relief you think, well that was silly and it’s not that deep I’m fine. And then this cycle of pressure builds up all over again and you just have to pretend like nothings wrong but you’re truly not ok. 
I can’t explain this to the people in my life cause I’ve always thought maybe I’m just making up my depression because I can go throughout my day. I’m not bed bound. But if I reflect on my life, I’ve always tried to cope in some way. I used to binge eat so much and I notice I have the urge to do it whenever I’m feeling especially down. Then it was movies &amp; tv shows I would drown myself in for hours and hours. Then it was music to drown out my own thoughts. It was reading endlessly at some point but I’ve lost all interest in all of those things and I find being awake to be so draining so now all I do is go to my classes and go to sleep. I hate being awake. I hate feeling this pressure in my chest and it sucks because I was free from it for a few months and it’s back and you just try and tell yourself you’re just having a bad day but you know it’s some sort of relapse. It’s hard because I don’t want to take medication, I don’t know if that’s going to make things worse for me and I don’t want to be numb I just don’t want to feel pain. On top of that there’s so much fucking stigma. I can’t talk to my parents about it cause whenever I do they get angry I feel sad because I’m their eyes they’ve given me the perfect life despite all the abuse when I was a child. I can’t talk to my friends cause they’re all optimists with the “it gets better” attitude and it pisses me off cause all I want is to get held and just cry. I always feel like I’m being punished for something and I don’t know what cause I try so hard to be there for others. Whenever I can’t find love and I see ordinary people super happy in relationships I question what’s wrong with me (I’m not saying I’m super attractive but I have assets that would at least attract people). when I start questioning why I can’t find a good relationship or someone who likes me it loops back into my thought of well how do I expect that to happen if my own father walked out on me as a child.

I just had to cut things off with this guy I was really into because I realized he just used me and didn’t care about me but now I’m like maybe I should just stick with him but at least I can pretend he cares about me.

Tossed aside.,"You guys ever been tossed aside like last month’s trash? Not a great feeling, especially when you already feel fucking worthless. My particular instance of this is made even worse by the fact that this situation arose from a douchebag throwing tons of money at the target of my affection. 

I don’t know where the money comes from, but it’s in large enough quantities that I have a suspicion the douchebag in question has some rich parents and hasn’t earned any of this affluence himself. It’s a real piss-off. 

I suppose what I should take away from this situation is that the girl in question is a money-grubbing whore. When I did have some disposable cash she was really sweet and affectionate. Not anymore since this fuckface entered the scenario. I’m really fucking fed up with this. 

I guess I need to just move on and write this girl off as what she’s presented herself to be now, an entitled, money-obsessed bitch.

I'm tired of the pain.,"I just can not keep doing this anymore. I keep reaching out for help, doctors push pills on me (I'm on five now) and therapists just try to push me into blaming my dead father. 

I can't afford my home. I can't afford my bills. I can't afford food and even the subreddits that claim to offer help just delete my posts because I lurk and my account doesn't have hundreds of karma.

I do not know what to do. I cry constantly. I hate my life and myself. I can't sleep I can't eat. 

I try to open up to people and they look at me like a monster.

I am a monster.

I'm about to lose my home and I have nothing left to sell to try to hang on to it. I sold all my dads belongings to make ends meet, he left those to me so I could have a good fun life and here I am a piece of garbage who can't even work a part time job to buy groceries. 

The state turns me away because I have income ($944/mo in disability).

I'm done. I can't do this. Why am I fighting? For who? I'm alone. My chest hurts, my eyes hurts. My head spins and I do not even know if any of this makes sense. I just can't keep this up. I have been fighting since I was a child, I'm a 38 year old man (ha) now. What do I have to offer to this world? All I am is a leech. I have no skills.

the first step.,"I've felt this way for a very long time. The feeling of inadequacy, the contempt of others, the anger, and the overwhelming loneliness. For such a long time, I've kept it bottled up, but now its beginning to boil over and I don't know how to handle it. This is my first time admitting to this and I think its easier to admit in anonymity than to my family. They wouldn't understand these feelings and I inevitably chase all of my friends away.  I have no hobbies or anything that I am good at so I just wallow in my sadness.  I dont want to be so absorbed in my own issues but its hard to overlook when it begins to bleed over into the things I used to care about like school. Being alive has never been a feeling that I can remember feeling happy about.I've come to live with pain and failure but I would just like the feeling to stop and feel even a modicum of  ""okay-ness."" Despite everything, I cant say I'm better off and I simply do not want to deal with any of it anymore to be honest.

Struggling,"A few years ago I was depressed and suicidal for several different reasons. I thought I worked through it. I thought I was better. But I’m 22 now and for about the last year, things have been gradually getting worse. I’m at the point now where I guess I’m probably passively suicidal? I have suicidal thoughts but I have no intention on acting on it. The urges to self harm have also occasionally come back, but I haven’t done anything.

I’m frustrated because nothing specifically happened to bring me back here. It just happened. I’m really struggling to see the light at the end of the tunnel. It feels like I put all that work in for nothing, I’m almost right back where I was and why keep putting so much effort into something that’s futile and I’m always just gunna end up here again.

I’m not quite at my lowest low, but I’m afraid if something doesn’t change I’ll get there. I guess for as long as I’m scared of being suicidal that’s hope.

Idk, I feel lonely and the few people close to me wouldn’t understand. I know that sounds cliche but truly none of them have had depression, and when I’ve tried approaching it they say something cliche and unhelpful like “things will get better I promise.” Or “try taking a walk, the sun and movement always helps me” Like yeah wow thanks I never thought to do that before lol. Granted maybe it’s partly my fault bc I haven’t really said the full extent of it so they don’t know how bad it is. But I still just don’t think I’d get anything helpful from them.

And idk if I’m gunna get anything helpful from here either and I’m not even really sure what my point is with this post, I’m just venting.

I feel like I'm doomed to just have bad luck,"I'm not a believer of anything spiritual or supernatural, but it truly does feel like I was cursed with bad luck or some shit.

A lot of it is just small things. Constantly getting the worst loot in video games, missing the public bus by like 30 seconds, etc. I always make small personal bets with myself like if I get a notification on Instagram I'll just be like ""I bet this specific person didn't like this post"" and I look at the notification and it's exactly that. This kind of shit is constantly happening everyday. By themselves it's not bad at all, but it really builds up and starts eating away at you.

And then there's bigger things. Like being 5'2 as a male is pretty bad. I have mental illnesses and some of it I can't even relate with other mentally ill people. I get bronchitis like every fucking year. And then tonight, I just got news that a field trip to Hawaii that I've been looking forward to for FOUR FUCKING YEARS has been cancelled because of the coronavirus bullshit. Of course it had to be the ONE FUCKING YEAR IM A SENIOR AND ABLE TO GO.

It just all piles up so fucking much. I feel like I'll just constantly have bad luck in life. It makes me lose excitement in things I'm actually excited for because I'm just in that mindset that it'll go wrong because of my bad luck. Makes me wonder if it's even worth living if I'm just stuck with this shit. Again, I don't believe in karma or the supernatural or anything, but this shit really makes me question it.",takedownhisshield,0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/fe7hjl/i_feel_like_im_doomed_to_just_have_bad_luck/,believer anything spiritual supernatural truly doe feel like wa cursed bad luck shit lot small thing constantly getting worst loot video game missing public bus like 30 second etc always make small personal bet like get notification instagram like bet specific person like post look notification exactly kind shit constantly happening everyday bad really build start eating away bigger thing like 5 2 male pretty bad mental illness even relate mentally ill people get bronchitis like every fucking year tonight got news field trip hawaii looking forward four fucking year ha cancelled coronavirus bullshit course one fucking year im senior able go pile fucking much feel like constantly bad luck life make lose excitement thing actually excited mindset go wrong bad luck make wonder even worth living stuck shit believe karma supernatural anything shit really make question,feel like doomed bad luck,takedown shield,1484,44,takedown shield believer anything spiritual supernatural truly doe feel like wa cursed bad luck shit lot small thing constantly getting worst loot video game missing public bus like 30 second etc always make small personal bet like get notification instagram like bet specific person like post look notification exactly kind shit constantly happening everyday bad really build start eating away bigger thing like 5 2 male pretty bad mental illness even relate mentally ill people get bronchitis like every fucking year tonight got news field trip hawaii looking forward four fucking year ha cancelled coronavirus bullshit course one fucking year im senior able go pile fucking much feel like constantly bad luck life make lose excitement thing actually excited mindset go wrong bad luck make wonder even worth living stuck shit believe karma supernatural anything shit really make question feel like doomed bad luck

An interesting title,"I'm back here. Yay, getting ready to rant out my god awful useless problems instead of revise for my mocks; which 2 of my A-Levels I'm going to fail. I don't want to do extra years in college, it's fucking horrible. I'm again crying out for help despite me not accepting it, or no one even giving me help; instead I'm getting help from the internet ""Oh wow how original, last time you did that you fell into a greater depression.""
 I hate my life, my family is horrible and struggling too. The world is fucked, people are disgusting; everyday I wish for a quick fucking death. I'm failing in school, I have no passion in what I do anymore and even better I don't know what I wanna be in the future.
God I don't know what to do with my life, I just wanna move out of England, go live a quiet life in Canada, somewhere where's there's no people, no problems and where I can die in peace. I don't know why I'm writing this. Again. For my own good I guess. I wish I could cry again, have a friend to talk to and feel open with. I miss my ex. Who was a fucking internet relationship that I fell deeply in love with. ""The retard has fallen in love with the E-boy"" how devilishly gay of me. I hate my life so much, god the thought of shoving a shotgun barrel into my mouth makes me so happy.
Please don't tell me ""it'll get better"" it won't. Life won't get better it will get worse. It has been. I don't really know why I said that because no one frankly cares about these posts, yeah you'll comment on one but after you don't know what will happen to them. It's funny, I went to one of those subreddits to make a friend in, and they fucking downvoted me. What a way to boost my confidence Internet. And make a friend. Fuck I hate myself.
I don't even know what I'm saying anymore. I want to sleep forever, I don't want to wake up tommorow to do my mock. I know I'll fail it. I'm a fucking failure.
Ask for help? I'm too worthless to ask, I won't accept it, I have too high standards or whatever. Idk. I've become the very thing I've sworn to destroy and that's a depressed sad fucking failure. I don't know what to do.
I'm just another one of the millions asking for help only to not take it. I'm unmotivated to do anything. God I want to cry so much.
I should stop, go look at some stupid pointless memes, suffer and regret my decisions and go look at my ex's profile for the 10th time this week. I hate myself and my life.

I’m fucking tired of being bullied over my disability,"So I’ve been dealing with this since the day I started medical school which was about 5 months ago . I’ve done my best to handle it all by myself but I’m fucking done . There’s no one around to talk to about it . I was diagnosed with Bell’s Palsy in 2015 , it recovered to some extent but didn’t go away . For the past 5 years every stranger I’ve met has in one way or another made fun of me , it was bad but in University it’s beyond fucked up . I haven’t had a single day when nobody laughed at me because of how FUCKED UP MY FACE IS . 
I used to be a pretty attractive person , I can’t hold my tears while writing all this . I still remember the time when I used to be pretty confident because of the way I looked . Now it’s just a dream . Every stranger I’ve met has in one way or another made fun of me . I am forced to stay alone everyday in school , my anxiety won’t let me move a muscle . Whenever or if ever  a stranger approach me with a smile , the moment I do the same they get confused and literally the first thing I’m asked is “what the fuck is wrong with your face?”
No body wants to be friends with me because they think I’m just a fucking retard who somehow made it into med school . 
Dating is just a whole another set of nightmares . I get rejected hardcore because of my face which completely disturbs my mental health . 
I feel helpless right now . Sometimes I get bullied to a point where Its feel like the only way to avoid all this is if either I commit suicide or the person trying to bully is gonna have to pay with their life .

I don't know how to ask for help,"My heart is screaming, my soul (and my right arm due to self harm) is bleeding and burning, I am feeling lower and lower each day that passes, I feel more and more like I will explode, several personnal reasons caused me to feel this way (sexual abuse, poverty, loneliness, studies, ill relatives, I am also possibly underdiagnosed when it comes to my mental health) but I don't know how to ask for help.

I don't know what to say, and I would feel guilty saying this to the people around me because I will bother them. 

I told it to my best friend but she is suicidal and severely depressed and she started to self harm again after I told her I self harmed and I don't want to make her feel worse. I want to support her although I don't have the strength to do that. I told it to a friend and to my sister as well and although they are helping and kind, I don't want to tell them how bad I feel. I don't know how to.

I tried to see psychologist but I have to wait untill at least april. This is a free psychologist and I can't afford to see another one earlier if it means I have to pay. My credit card has been stolen anyway lol.

Anyway, my way of coping with all of this is to put myself in danger and make myself feel physically bad in the hope I will feel more valid in my suffering and that I will finally be able to ask for help and feel like I deserve it.

I'm starting to have unrealistic thoughts of the future,"Home life is really bad at the moment, both parents are alcoholics and recently their drinking had been getting a lot worse. It's cause both sides of my family to argue due to my parents lack of care over my younger sister. I want to move out but I do not have the money, I don't really have anywhere to go, I want to call social services on my parents (again) but I can't as I'll be kicked out and have my belongings potentially trashed. My parents have never been there for me, I didn't have the best childhood, which has caused me to have an unfortunate array of mental disorders and depression. But now I'm starting to think I'll win the lottery of 1 million and everything will be okay, I keep thinking I'm going to win money and then I can move out and give me and my sister a better life for both of us. It's getting to the point that I'm daydreaming constantly of winning a large sum of money, and that I can get my own place and my sister will be okay. Ive started to genuinely think I'm a millionare.

Cursed,"I feel like I’m cursed. I don’t understand what I’ve done to deserve this. I try to be good, I’m not an evil person... I care, I try to be there, I try to help to others. My entire life has been shit... addicted parents who’ve never been there emotionally for me, abusive relationships, eating disorders, anxiety, depression... 

It’s funny how one little thing can change everything. As March started, I truthfully started feeling better, things were on the up and up... I even went to the gym and worked out yesterday, fully motivated to keep it going. Then, last night yet another curse. Now we’re back at square one, and the worst part is I have no one. I’m alone, physically and emotionally. I don’t have any friends or family to talk to or confide in. My partner is just as bad as I am in terms of mental state, so I can’t rely on him emotionally at all. I’ve managed to get through so many things in my life... and I thought they would make me strong.... but I was completely wrong. I’m weak.

"""Chemical Imbalance""","&gt; **[Trigger Warning: self-harm descriptions]** I found this in my notes in my phone from 4 years ago. I forgot how much I used to write about what it was like living inside my mind back when I was at my lowest point.

**Chemical Imbalance**  

It always starts with something taken out of proportion. A misread text, a misunderstood gesture, a misjudged opinion, or a misguided tone.  
“I love you.” They attempt to bring you back to a reasoning reality.  
But love isn't *love* anymore.  
Love is fake.  
Love is wrong.  
Love is *hate*.  
*I hate you*. Their mimicked voice echoes.   
Triggering the avalanche of spiteful words spraying from your pale lips.   
*They hate you*. The voice darkens.  
You watch them slowly fall into your torturous whirlwind of abuse. You watch them cry for help and ask for you to stop and listen to yourself, listening to you hate yourself and want to die is too much for them.  
Then you watch them leave. You watch them run away in fear.   

Your bony fingers crack as they clench into a fist. Your jagged nails are digging into your skin.   
Anger engulfs your vision, taking control of rationality.  
The first blow strikes hard on your face. It stings, but you go a second time. And a third. Until your head starts ringing.   
*You seriously fucked up this time*. The dark voice echoes.  
You can't see anything for what it really is.  
“But you said they hated me!” You argue with the little self-worth you have left.   
*Yes, and you believed me. You stupid little girl*.  
That restless feeling of guilt starts trickling down your spine. Did you jump to conclusions? Did you just impulsively hurt a loved one’s feelings? Did you just make them witness something so traumatic it will never leave them?  
*Yes, you're a twisted abuser*.  

No, you can't be here. You can't be alive anymore. You don't deserve it. You have hurt someone who needs you, you have acted out of spite.  
*Do it. You're worthless. They don't want or need you here*.  
More impulsive actions unfold, you only want to escape the guilt and anger that overfills your head. But you're scared to do it. You're scared to make the final exit by your hand.   
*Cowardice. You can't live and you can't die. You are pathetic*.  

The razor is in view. Tears are finally pushing out, causing more pain than the blade that now pierces your skin. Scarred and thin, the skin breaks. But no satisfaction is found unless you cut too deep. Only disappointment seeps in, blaming yourself for your cowardly slashes. Not going deep enough, pathetic little scratches. Why can't you feel more pain? Why can't you cut deeper?   
*You fail at even the simplest things*.  
You cut more. Faster, harder. You want centimetres, not millimetres.  
But still the same depth, still the same shit.  

There’re too many cuts now. But still no pain, only numbness from the raw wounds you view.   
But the blood won't stop. Your wrists are painted. Like stained crimson cloaks wrapped around each arm.   
You slip in the dark puddle and feel the red wetness of the towel you clench.    
“Take me!” You scream.   
“Please just take me!” You keep screaming at the otherworldly force.   
Pleading for the way out, pleading your heart would just stop.   
Now a mess of tears and blood on the floor, you weep.   
The sounds of silence bounces in your head.  
The dark voice is gone.   
Nothing.  

A door opens.   
The realisation of someone witnessing the mess you are in kicks you up.   
You can smell the shame from your cold sweat. You can see the damage you've caused yourself and the one who is about the enter.  

“I'm sorry.” You whisper.   
You are numb and frozen as they wrap the bandages around your wrists.   
“I'm sorry.”   
You can see the pain in their eyes. You can feel the fear in their trembles. You can hear the confusion in their silence.  

*You don't deserve this love*. The dark voice echoes.   
And then you fall back into the abyss.",poppi__054,0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/fea7zb/chemical_imbalance/,gt trigger warning self harm description found note phone 4 year ago forgot much used write wa like living inside mind back wa lowest point chemical imbalance always start something taken proportion misread text misunderstood gesture misjudged opinion misguided tone love attempt bring back reasoning reality love love anymore love fake love wrong love hate hate mimicked voice echo triggering avalanche spiteful word spraying pale lip hate voice darkens watch slowly fall torturous whirlwind abuse watch cry help ask stop listen listening hate want die much watch leave watch run away fear bony finger crack clench fist jagged nail digging skin anger engulfs vision taking control rationality first blow strike hard face sting go second time third head start ringing seriously fucked time dark voice echo see anything really said hated argue little self worth left yes believed stupid little girl restless feeling guilt start trickling spine jump conclusion impulsively hurt loved one feeling make witness something traumatic never leave yes twisted abuser alive anymore deserve hurt someone need acted spite worthless want need impulsive action unfold want escape guilt anger overfills head scared scared make final exit hand cowardice live die pathetic razor view tear finally pushing causing pain blade pierce skin scarred thin skin break satisfaction found unless cut deep disappointment seeps blaming cowardly slash going deep enough pathetic little scratch feel pain cut deeper fail even simplest thing cut faster harder want centimetre millimetre still depth still shit many cut still pain numbness raw wound view blood stop wrist painted like stained crimson cloak wrapped around arm slip dark puddle feel red wetness towel clench take scream please take keep screaming otherworldly force pleading way pleading heart would stop mess tear blood floor weep sound silence bounce head dark voice gone nothing door open realisation someone witnessing mess kick smell shame cold sweat see damage caused one enter sorry whisper numb frozen wrap bandage around wrist sorry see pain eye feel fear tremble hear confusion silence deserve love dark voice echo fall back abyss,chemical imbalance,poppi 054,3939,20,poppi 054 gt trigger warning self harm description found note phone 4 year ago forgot much used write wa like living inside mind back wa lowest point chemical imbalance always start something taken proportion misread text misunderstood gesture misjudged opinion misguided tone love attempt bring back reasoning reality love love anymore love fake love wrong love hate hate mimicked voice echo triggering avalanche spiteful word spraying pale lip hate voice darkens watch slowly fall torturous whirlwind abuse watch cry help ask stop listen listening hate want die much watch leave watch run away fear bony finger crack clench fist jagged nail digging skin anger engulfs vision taking control rationality first blow strike hard face sting go second time third head start ringing seriously fucked time dark voice echo see anything really said hated argue little self worth left yes believed stupid little girl restless feeling guilt start trickling spine jump conclusion impulsively hurt loved one feeling make witness something traumatic never leave yes twisted abuser alive anymore deserve hurt someone need acted spite worthless want need impulsive action unfold want escape guilt anger overfills head scared scared make final exit hand cowardice live die pathetic razor view tear finally pushing causing pain blade pierce skin scarred thin skin break satisfaction found unless cut deep disappointment seeps blaming cowardly slash going deep enough pathetic little scratch feel pain cut deeper fail even simplest thing cut faster harder want centimetre millimetre still depth still shit many cut still pain numbness raw wound view blood stop wrist painted like stained crimson cloak wrapped around arm slip dark puddle feel red wetness towel clench take scream please take keep screaming otherworldly force pleading way pleading heart would stop mess tear blood floor weep sound silence bounce head dark voice gone nothing door open realisation someone witnessing mess kick smell shame cold sweat see damage caused one enter sorry whisper numb frozen wrap bandage around wrist sorry see pain eye feel fear tremble hear confusion silence deserve love dark voice echo fall back abyss chemical imbalance

"problems in my new career path, now regretting it all.","*I apologize in advance for any terms i use which may not be common to most readers* 
I was once proud of this and now i see it as a neutral thing, but i joined the army. at first i loved the comeraderie, pt, rucks, etc. and basic was a lot of fun with the grenades, obstacle courses, etc. but now im an academic fail out from AIT (job training in the army). its really painful living as a holdover. for those who are thinking ""wtf is a holdover?"": a holdover is someone who for whatever reason failed from their training, got injured, or in at least moderately serious trouble. the job of a holdover is mostly sitting on bleachers all day near the drill sergeants officespace until the end of the workday.  they will sometimes clean or perform some paper work on occasion. i contribute nothing, do nothing, and all the while watching my old friends earn the exact position that i spent the last several months of working my heart out for. im not angry at them, so much as i am just really... frustrated. because of my jobs academic difficulty, this is really not uncommon but ive been stuck here as a holdover for over a month now. 9 hours per day, 5 days per week, of sitting and doing next to nothing. i feel like a drain on society while also miserable with the ""work"" i am doing. 

i used to think that i wasnt contributing to anything while training but was fine with it because my job was to learn to be a soldier. but now i have no job, no purpose, and none of the old freedoms i had as a civilian as a consolation. i still have to abide by the ""battle buddy"" system in which soldiers in basic and AIT cannot ever be without another soldier around except for very specific circumstances. i am not allowed off base (which is less than 2 square miles of space). and i cannot have things like electronics during the time in which im ""working"" to pass the time. this has all made me thoroughly reexamine my reasons for every decision ive ever made.

at first when i failed out i knew id be sent to a new MOS (army job). id hoped for armor (tank stuff), artillery, infantry, or really just anything except for signals (computers, which frustrate me to my wits end), medical (im afraid of needles), and transport (i hate working on cars). and the drill sergeant said the best case scenario, id be sent off to be an IT specialist. i was nothing short of devastated. 

Just one month ago, i was what youd think of when you thought of a bubbly, outgoing, and motivated soldier. Today i realized i had an issue when a drill sgt that i very much look up to came back after being gone for a few months and she noticed that i was showing signs of being ""off"" before i even really said anything. 

I used to be really great at pt, and now im doing so poorly that i may get kicked out of the army entirely. im stressed, saddened by my prospects, and overall just ashamed of where i am. if it werent for my gf whose been nothing short of incredible, there is no way i would have ever made it this far. but now it feels like in the process of joining the army, i started walking from new york to california, i was getting close to nevada until i tripped, got knocked the fuck out, and woke up in ohio. and now im just staring at the map thinking how itd be so much easier to just turn back and cut my losses.

It's unfair that I have to live with this burden everyday and they can go about their lives without caring.,"At the end of last July, a boy I thought I liked had a party at my house. I got drunker than I ever have in my life and I kind of got taken advantage of, and I really think about it a lot. How could this person that I thought was my friend let this happen to me? Why is it that everyone was mad at me for crying about it after it happened, why did everyone tell me I was making a scene, telling me I was making it a bigger deal than it really was. I've carried this ever since it happened and I can't make it go away, I can't stop thinking about it.

My family is moving out of that house now and I found a pile of the boy's shit that they all left at my house that night. I threw it all away and it didn't make me feel any better, it just made me wonder why I still had it.

And my parents tell me im not allowed to tell a doctor, because the intrusive thoughts could endanger my planned out medical career. Life has become too much to bear and i cant take it. Ive become so stressed my eye has started to twitch almost every time i blink. I cant escape, and not even suicide is an answer anymore. It doesnt help that it feels like everyone god damn hates me. Any mistake i make, i always have a thought like ""wow, that person probably hates me now"" and i cant live with my own thoughts.

"I’ve lost 4 pounds since Monday, this is just getting worse","I don’t like to complain and so I don’t talk about my depression a lot to my friends/loved ones, I don’t want to worry them or be annoying. It’s been getting progressively worse recently though, I’m dropping weight like crazy (I’ve never had it interfere with weight before), when I do try to talk about it, things get minimized and nobody really gives a f*ck. I had my s/o tell me that I was “not really sad” yesterday, and that messed with me because not only has he not known me for the majority of my life, but just because I don’t like to talk about my problems doesn’t mean they don’t exist. He really has no idea. My mom is a therapist so when I try to talk to her she just gets overly worried, and my dad generally follows her lead with that. I understand why they worry, a couple years ago I had a pretty bad suicide attempt and a near fatal overdose (od was an accident, I was just being dumb) within less than 6 months of each other, they worry that it’ll happen again. It gets annoying though because I feel like I can’t even say I’m sad without “are you on drugs again” etc. Now that I think about it maybe this post doesn’t make sense/ is all over the place, I guess it’s easier to vent to strangers on the internet than the people in my life.",[deleted],1,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/fe407t/ive_lost_4_pounds_since_monday_this_is_just/,like complain talk depression lot friend loved one want worry annoying getting progressively worse recently though dropping weight like crazy never interfere weight try talk thing get minimized nobody really give f ck tell wa really sad yesterday messed ha known majority life like talk problem mean exist really ha idea mom therapist try talk get overly worried dad generally follows lead understand worry couple year ago pretty bad suicide attempt near fatal overdose od wa accident wa dumb within le 6 month worry happen get annoying though feel like even say sad without drug etc think maybe post make sense place guess easier vent stranger internet people life,lost 4 pound since monday getting worse,deleted,1257,59,deleted like complain talk depression lot friend loved one want worry annoying getting progressively worse recently though dropping weight like crazy never interfere weight try talk thing get minimized nobody really give f ck tell wa really sad yesterday messed ha known majority life like talk problem mean exist really ha idea mom therapist try talk get overly worried dad generally follows lead understand worry couple year ago pretty bad suicide attempt near fatal overdose od wa accident wa dumb within le 6 month worry happen get annoying though feel like even say sad without drug etc think maybe post make sense place guess easier vent stranger internet people life lost 4 pound since monday getting worse

Why does no one talk about consent and decision making in a more serious context with depression?,"Recently, im going through a severe depressive episode and I did some things I would not have otherwise done that are now affecting my mental health further and affecting someone I love. 

I would like to hear those with severe depression talk about whether they feel they have the ability to consent and make decisions on sensitive matters during severe depressive episodes.

It feels like society tells everyone that it is their fault if they make a bad decision, that they are responsible for their choices, and most dont understand mental illness properly and to me its not that black and white. 

I want to know whether you think you truly have the capacity to be at fault for a decision youve made if it is something you would not have done outside an acute depressive episode.

Four abilities are usually assessed with decision making when I was looking around. The only studies I found were for research purposes (which saddens me, but thats a whole other topic).

The four abilities:
Understanding
Appreciating
Reasoning
Ability to express a choice

Now I cant say I know the exact ways to interpet these 4 things right now without further research but, do you feel you possess these abilities during a severe depressive episode? Do you possess some and not others? Does it vary? 

My answer would be during a severe depressive episode, I do not possess any of these reliably at every moment. It is not consistent enough for me to able to say I possess any of them during these times.

"When you try so hard, still fail. Depression is always there.","I have been through a very hard life, from my single parent mother being addicted to drugs, being in Foster care for 7 years, to being homeless for 6 years. I have and had finally gotten myself where I needed to be. I got a puppy I love dearly and has been my Emotional Support animal. I do everything in life for him now. I finally got my own place after 4 years. I have a great job that I am happy to go to and I can afford to pay my bills and all of my habits/ needs. Today I got a notice to vacat after spending months fighting over Landlord Obligations. I lost my old job a month ago because of the emotional distress that  I was in. I literally told my manager ""How can i care about someones remote not working and sit with all sincerity to trouble shoot, and I go home everyday to no heat and my dog shaking uncontrollable, but keeps a smile on his face for me?"" I was unable to pay my electric bill, so they are trying to evict me on the premise of breaking the lease. All of this is breaking my faith. I am trying so hard, but everytime I get a head there's something trying to break me. Today I have fallen back into my depression and cant help but say it's better to give my pup away to someone more stable and kill myself. I cant keep going and dealing with uncertainty or being homeless. I try so hard everyday, to just get pushed back into the void.

Can your body get depressed without you knowing it,"My question is can your body get depressed 
Without you even knowing it?
So the last few months I've seen some changes 
In my body, getting 4 hours sleep if I'm lucky
And it's broken, not wanting to go out because 
I'm so tired, everytime I eat I feel sick. 
But the thing is my mind feels okay and
Yes I've had suffered from depression many 
Times before, also a few other things. I see 
My doctor on a regular basis, but of late it's 
Been hard finding the right time. It wasn't until 
A few days I thought my body might be depressed,
I started thinking about the stuff that has been 
Going on with me for the last few months and I 
Remember that I had a major operation about 
7 months ago and that's when it all started and
Has gotten worse over time. The reason that
I'm asking here is because I don't want to 
Worry family or friends and I find it hard to talk 
To them about this stuff because they don't 
Really understand it. So my question is can your

Need help,"Hi I don't really know how to phrase this situation but I'll try. My life is at a really good point right now, I'm never really depressed over stuff and 99 percent of the time my mind is clear. I'm about to graduate high school and I'm really excited. However, people in my family and friend group have tons of issues. Wether they sleep all day, hate themselves, or have no ambition to keep living on in this world, they've got problems. I don't wanna sound like I'm gloating, but usually I'm the person that a lot of these people end up going to because usually I'm able to talk people through issues and help them in the long run. Yeah sometimes their issues make me really sad and stuff because who doesn't feel sad when people are telling you they feel worthless.

But today one of my best friends showed me that he was cutting and it really effected me. I talked to him about it and it's mostly because of how painfully ""bored"" he is and he doesn't even know why he's doing it (he's a pretty logical guy). He will go to class and just sit there for and hour most of the time doing nothing challenging because that's the way our school works. He has clinically diagnosed depression, has been to a psychiatric ward, and sees a therapist regularly. It's only been a couple hours since he showed me his arm, and I didn't even see all of it. 

I've got two main problems right now. First I don't really know how to help him. He said literally the only thing I can really do is just hang out with him after school and on the weekends so he doesn't just sit in bed all day. I've been trying to make an effort to do that as much as I can but I need to do more. He said himself that as long as he goes to highschool, and considering it's the law, he's going to feel this way until we graduate. I just need to know something I can do to help him, do I tell his parents? A therapist won't help he already goes to one. Should I talk to him more about it tomorrow. I just don't know

Second, stuff like this is really effecting me. I just feel that the world is being unfair to everyone I care about and I just want everyone I love to feel better. As of lately I've been feeling depressed whenever my friends need to talk about issues and it's really weighing down on me. I just don't want to leave the people I care about down in the dirt. 

So yeah if anyone has any advice whatsoever please help me. Im normally able to deal with these feelings and help my friends but right now I'm struggling.

It WiLl GeT bEtTeR wItH TiMe,"Just a little insight about my life 


3 years ago I lost the last vehicle I would ever own

3 years ago I lost the I only place i had to live

Ive lost at least 2-3 jobs in a 3 year span

2 years ago I lost the girl i loved

1 year ago I lost a career I was failing in

6 months ago i was eating good, showering daily I got a job and started fixing my life made plans fo get another car pay some debt

Today I am jobless, homeless, hungry don’t shower often dont eat much, isolate my self



Because I miss life. I miss going out and being able to socialize and I miss like dating and stuff and wearing clean clothes paying bills on time and not being behind miss having a drivers license and not being in fear everytime I get behind the wheel, miss having the Apartment for having girls just come over when ever they want, I miss eating good I miss shopping for things, 

Im barely living  and have been doing that for the past 3 years 

Everytime I get a job I try and fix my credit, and I can never seem to keep with it

I have to live my life with zero payments and buy everything with cash because I clearly can not keep up with them

Sometimes I wish my life was worse so I can receive sympathy,"My life, from an outside perspective, is objectively comfortable . I’m not terribly rich, but I have a roof over my head and food on my plate, with money to spare for my hobbies. I have a group of close supportive friends. 

I have depression. I’ve had it on and off since I was 11, but it’s been consistently bad for the past year. Everyday is filled with excruciating pain and loneliness.
But I often wish it was worse. I’m ashamed to admit that I sometimes wish my parents died all of a sudden or that my house will burn down or that I’ll get in a bad accident so that I’ll receive public sympathy. I’ll FINALLY have something concrete to complain about! Because guess what? Right now, I *don’t* have much concrete things to complain about. At least not things I can tell people publicly.

I guess another way to put it is that I’m desperate for attention, although I don’t like the connotation that comes with that phrase (as true as it may be). My head’s constantly battling these dark thoughts. My life is a living hell, and I’m frustrated that nobody’s taken notice, when it’s my own damn fault I’m not opening up to anybody.

Life is just a cruel joke,"Do yall ever feel so numb and empty, but at the same time you feel so much pain and emotions ? And its so confusing but what are you gonna do about it ?  
Just last week I was feeling better, and now I'm back at the bottom

I don't understand. I have an amazing boyfriend and friends, my family is shitty but I know they do love me, I've just suffered from so much emotional trauma from them.

And I do feel happy sometimes. When I'm with my friends and boyfriend all we do is talk and laugh, but when I'm alone I feel so hopeless. Which makes me wonder if I'm actually even depressed.

It hurts, everything hurts so much.  
I just found out my, ""best friend"" who I've known for 6 years, doesn't want to be my friend anymore. Because I've been so busy with school, and I've been so stressed and just exhausted I haven't seen her in a few weeks and then I found out today from her brother.

My family is a wreck, my mom is always telling me about all her problems and I have to listen and counsel her, I'm just a teenager mom,  I wish you would take me to that doctors appointment like you promised you would so maybe I could actually get some help, instead of running off and leaving for days to God knows where.

I haven't been to church in weeks, church has always been so important to me, but lately I don't want to go, I don't want to see the people there that I've known since I was a baby. I don't want to do anything in my free time but lay on my bed.

I want to cry, I want to cry so badly but I can't. I physically cannot cry, and so I'm just here, shaking, in pain, and at the same time feeling nothing. I'm so scared, I don't want to do this anymore, I can't do it anymore I just want it all to go away. I want to go to sleep and never wake up.

Inability to be better,"I have found that one of the main issues keeping me from being productive and moving forward is my inability to believe in myself. That is, I’m too worried about what others perceive me to be, and never being able to relax and exist in the moment. I’ve had therapy and medication for depression but none of it helps. If I can’t be better or get better, what’s the point? Why shouldn’t I just kill myself? I don’t want to keep trying. Life is boring. All my wildest dreams always lead to me ending up alone in some way or another. All so I can die without hurting anyone.

What are things I should consider before killing myself?,"I think I'm going to kill myself some time within the next week, but I wanted to make sure I'm doing my due diligence before making any rash decisions. I've already fixed my diet, created a stable exercise routine, received therapy, reached out to my support group, and contacted the suicide hotline.

I'm not going to explain why I want to commit suicide, but I do want to ask what I should think of before choosing to make the ultimate decision. I'm not talking about, ""Think of how sad your mom will be!"" Rather, the idea that if I killed myself in my apartment, the police might accuse my roommate of murder, or if I were to jump off a building, someone would have to identify my mangled body.

I don't know what's wrong with me.,"Let me start of by saying I'm not diagnosed, I haven't really experienced any traumatic incidents in my life and I have no intention of harming myself.

However, due to events in recent months, I feel so empty, like I don't give a fuck about doing anything. Even feeding myself has become something I try to avoid. I don't take care of my appearance, I do the minimal work I need to get by and I rarely socialize with the few friends I have.

These are part in part to a belief that has formed in my head: life is meaningless. What is the point of doing anything? We slave away through school, to get a place at university, then we slave away through uni to get a good degree, then we slave away in a job we will probably hate to make sure we don't end up on the streets. All this, all this pointless cycle and in the grand scheme if things, it makes no difference.

I think a lot of times to myself, if I were to disappear now, would anything be affected? Have I had any impact at all on the world? Will I even be remembered? The answers are always no. This has produced an emptiness inside me.

The emptiness leads to a lack of people, activities and more, which in turn leave me feeling lonely and unfulfilled respectively. Yet I again feel a lack of desire to do anything. I don't know what this is or why I think like this, but I would appreciate it if anyone could give me some sort of method or exercise to break this cycle.",throwaway22599172i,4,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/fe64pv/i_dont_know_whats_wrong_with_me/,let start saying diagnosed really experienced traumatic incident life intention harming however due event recent month feel empty like give fuck anything even feeding ha become something try avoid take care appearance minimal work need get rarely socialize friend part part belief ha formed head life meaningless point anything slave away school get place university slave away uni get good degree slave away job probably hate make sure end street pointless cycle grand scheme thing make difference think lot time disappear would anything affected impact world even remembered answer always ha produced emptiness inside emptiness lead lack people activity turn leave feeling lonely unfulfilled respectively yet feel lack desire anything know think like would appreciate anyone could give sort method exercise break cycle,know wrong,throwaway 22599172,1431,34,throwaway 22599172 let start saying diagnosed really experienced traumatic incident life intention harming however due event recent month feel empty like give fuck anything even feeding ha become something try avoid take care appearance minimal work need get rarely socialize friend part part belief ha formed head life meaningless point anything slave away school get place university slave away uni get good degree slave away job probably hate make sure end street pointless cycle grand scheme thing make difference think lot time disappear would anything affected impact world even remembered answer always ha produced emptiness inside emptiness lead lack people activity turn leave feeling lonely unfulfilled respectively yet feel lack desire anything know think like would appreciate anyone could give sort method exercise break cycle know wrong

Feeling helpless and hopeless,"It's been a hard couple months. 

To break it down in a simpler manner; 
I'm a General Manager at a restaurant, working ~65 hours per week. My husband is 29 years old, diagnosed with Crohns about seven years ago. He has been unable to work for roughly 2 years. About a year and a half ago, he had a surgery that required removing roughly 6 feet of his intestines. Due to us not having health insurance until recently, hes been unable to do follow up appointments or get onto much needed medication to manage his disease. His Crohns is getting worse. We finally got him into the doctor's in January when we got health insurance. They've done several CT scans, and keep finding more and more abcesses developing in his intestines. He has another surgery scheduled for this upcoming Tuesday, but he had to go into the hospital again today, due to an abscess that is bulging out of his stomach. I have two puppies at home. With my husband being in the hospital, and myself working ridiculous hours, it puts a lot more on my plate than I have already with work. I feel like a narcissistic POS wife, because while my poor husband is in the hospital, I'm more worried about how much more stress has been put on me. 
I've been through a lot of trauma in my life. A physically abusive father growing up really messed with me, and I'm just now realizing the impact it's had on my every day life. I was in a 4 year relationship with a man who cheated on me the entire time we were together. He abused me physically, verbally and sexually. Manipulated me, and really mentally screwed me over. I was the one paying our bills (on $13 an hour) while he sat at home for 4 years doing absolutely nothing. 
I've been through a lot like I said. Most of these situations I have put myself in. 
I'm constantly tired, unmotivated, and angry. All the time. I've reached a point where I just want to give up. I feel like I'm in a neverending cycle of problems. I fix one thing, and three more bad things get thrown at me. I'm working my ass off every day, plus some, and I have nothing to show for it, since we are so far into medical sent that we are scrounging for money. I'm 25 years old and I feel like I'm 50. I've had several panic attacks over the past couple months, many if which have happened multiple times per day. Anytime I go to the doctor for my anxiety/depression/ADD, they throw whatever meds they can pull out of their ass at me, and tell me to come back a couple months later. I have tried several medications and none of them seem to do anything for me except zombify me. I've tried journaling, I have tried exercising regularly, i have tried everything i feel like!!! I dont know what else to do. My friends are no longer existant, and I dont have anyone to talk to.

TL;DR Tell me some kindness you've witnessed or received.

I have been unemployed since December and I was holding on until I got my tax refund so I could see my psychiatrist for new meds, fixing my car, anything until I can get another job. Then the government took it all for student loans.

I used all my energy and grit to get here, only to be still stranded and lower than ever. I don't talk to my friends anymore about it because they just think being strong is the key and that I will be fine. I don't feel fine. I used everything up and now I am here, jobless, broke, and not even caring to take care of myself anymore. What's the point, you know?

Vacations,"I just got back from a week long stay on the big island of Hawaii. I had some of the coolest experiences from seeing a shark while snorkeling, to being right next to feeding manta rays. It was an amazing trip and I loved it so much. 

But the problem I have is that whenever I have gone on vacations, even when I was young, I would cry and be horribly depressed for the next few days to a week or two. I hate going on vacations because I know that I’m going to feel like shit after. Nothing feels right when I come home and I just want to be spending “one more day” out away from real life. I hate it because I know that I will have to go back to work and that I won’t get another vacation like this for a very long time. I hate that I can’t explain how I’m feeling to my wife because she’s lucky enough not to have to experience depression except from a third person perspective. 

I so badly want to still be out on Hawaii, or anywhere I’ve gone on vacation to, because out there, I don’t have to care about work; I don’t have to care about school, bills, or family drama. I can just be. I don’t want to have to go back to work and school on Monday, but I know I have to or else things will be worse in the long run. I hate that I’m feeling like I shouldn’t have gone to Hawaii in the first place. 

I loved spending all that time with my wife and enjoying that week together. I loved seeing things that I never have before and being somewhere that I haven’t been. I loved having that time to do whatever I wanted and not feeling badly that I didn’t do anything I didn’t want to. I loved the anticipation and excitement leading up to the day we left. 

I think that’s from where a lot of my depression stems: building up the anticipation, then it’s here and it’s so great, but then it’s gone sooner than it arrived, and you go back to anticipating nothing. 

I feel like life is mostly boring, dull, and no one really wants to admit that, so when you get a few days to enjoy yourself, after, it feels like the nothingness deepens and you sink further into it. 

I don’t know if this made any sense or if anyone is going to read this, but I really just want to stop crying and go to bed.",Papyrus_Sans,1,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/fe8u6h/vacations/,got back week long stay big island hawaii coolest experience seeing shark snorkeling right next feeding manta ray wa amazing trip loved much problem whenever gone vacation even wa young would cry horribly depressed next day week two hate going vacation know going feel like shit nothing feel right come home want spending one day away real life hate know go back work get another vacation like long time hate explain feeling wife lucky enough experience depression except third person perspective badly want still hawaii anywhere gone vacation care work care school bill family drama want go back work school monday know else thing worse long run hate feeling like gone hawaii first place loved spending time wife enjoying week together loved seeing thing never somewhere loved time whatever wanted feeling badly anything want loved anticipation excitement leading day left think lot depression stem building anticipation great gone sooner arrived go back anticipating nothing feel like life mostly boring dull one really want admit get day enjoy feel like nothingness deepens sink know made sense anyone going read really want stop cry go bed,vacation,papyrus sans,2188,9,papyrus sans got back week long stay big island hawaii coolest experience seeing shark snorkeling right next feeding manta ray wa amazing trip loved much problem whenever gone vacation even wa young would cry horribly depressed next day week two hate going vacation know going feel like shit nothing feel right come home want spending one day away real life hate know go back work get another vacation like long time hate explain feeling wife lucky enough experience depression except third person perspective badly want still hawaii anywhere gone vacation care work care school bill family drama want go back work school monday know else thing worse long run hate feeling like gone hawaii first place loved spending time wife enjoying week together loved seeing thing never somewhere loved time whatever wanted feeling badly anything want loved anticipation excitement leading day left think lot depression stem building anticipation great gone sooner arrived go back anticipating nothing feel like life mostly boring dull one really want admit get day enjoy feel like nothingness deepens sink know made sense anyone going read really want stop cry go bed vacation

This is a “throwaway” account I guess, but my reason for posting is not to say I’m sick and about to end it, but I’m hoping there are ways to help it. I can’t do this ‘train your brain’ crap or self help books. I’ve had numerous meds but lose sense of who I am. Is there a physical therapy, shock, sleep etc etc that can jolt you out of this mental rut?  I have my vision on psychedelic therapies, those look promising.

Feeling lonely and isolated,"Ok so I suffer with seasonal depression, and this winter has been significantly worse than last. Last winter I was around friends, and family. I was at home. This year I'm in a new city. I moved last summer for university, to try and get away from what/who I once was. I have met some amazing people here, but nobody seems to have any time to care for me. 

Heres a quick rundown of my 2020 so far:
I got a shoulder injury, had time out of the gym, was unable to compete because I was too weak. 
My girlfriend of 2.5 years and I split up. 
I developed a drug addiction to cope with the pain. 
I've hated my body more than ever and have lost all appetite and stopped eating. 
Sex drive has plummeted. 
Started hooking up with a girl but couldnt maintain an erection- realised I was using her for hugs and kisses to numb the feeling of loneliness.

I want to go to a doctor but my brain keeps telling me I'm feeling sorry for myself and this is all for attention. I even feel like this writing this post. 

I hate myself and genuinely don't want to die but I can't see any other options.

death,"I just can’t stop thinking about it, it’s constant, it’s all i think about. Before i sleep, when i wake up, and whenever my minds not totally occupied. Sometimes i contemplate suicide: the action then followed by thoughts of an afterlife, if there’s even one. I can never stop obsessing over it and normally i’m the one giving advice such as life and so forth, but recently i’ve been actually contemplating “what happens when we’re all dead?” and that just keeps me up and thinking every moment. This is made worse by people telling me “don’t worry it’ll all be okay” or “just live life to the fullest” something cheesy and dumb. Quite honestly, if life is as pointless as i think and as it seems, aren’t we just better off dead? To live is to suffer, pain after pain, at what gain? The humiliation and satisfaction of nothing short of a horrible life. The experiences all meaning nothing once we’re gone, and yet we’re all still here? Why? Just why?

Lol!,All my friends and family are so confused by my increasingly poor life decisions lately and I never have a good excuse. What am I supposed to tell them? That I’m so upset that it feels impossible to prioritize even the most important tasks. That I feel so lost that I don’t give a fuck about the future consequences because of how much pain I’m in now? And why I don’t bother telling anyone? Why I just keep it to myself and don’t even want to use the word depression to describe myself? Because I honestly feel like a little entitled bitch trying to use mental health as an excuse for being lazy but I truthfully have not been content with anything in my life for the past 3 years and it feels like there’s no escape from my mind. I’ve fantasized my suicide several times a day everyday for the last few months even though I have no plans of doing so. It gives me disturbing comfort.

I don’t know what to write here,"I’m 22. I’ve dealt with depression since Highschool, and I thought I got better for...I was doing great, went to college, got a job...But recently my anxiety has gotten really bad again...I dated this girl for a little over a year, then I felt myself slipping back into that depression (it was a long distance relationship, I’m in Cali, and she’s back home across the country) anyway...I started getting bored I guess with the relationship because it was just like being in a relationship with facetime...We would try to meet up every now and then...But maybe saw each other about 3 to 4 times a year, and the distance just got in the way, and we decided mutually to sorta break it off. We would still FaceTime everyday, we’d pick a movie to watch together and it was just like we were dating still, but I couldn’t tell her I love her anymore. And that’s when my depression started coming back...Well, fast forward a few months, it’s Christmas I’m home, and she spends my whole first day with me and my family. We wound up sleeping together that night, then the next day she has to leave because she has a job in a different state...We talked about what had happened, and she said it didn’t mean anything. And I thought we were going to get back together again. But that never happened. Now, more recently...She started telling me about this other guy she’s dating, and I try to be supportive she’s moving on, so why can’t I? All I can think about is them together, and him making her happier than me, like I wasn’t good enough for her, but if she’s happy with another guy then why do I want her to be unhappy with me? And I just keep having this one thought of them sleeping together. And that won’t get out of my mind. It’s all I think about every time she tells me they’re hanging out. The thoughts don’t stop, so I drink, and when I drink I cut, and I don’t wanna cut anymore so I stopped drinking, and started scratching my fingers to the point it bleeds and scabs over, and it’s only when I get panic attacks, but I get panic attacks every time I think about her, because when I think about her I think about him, and when I do that I see them “together” and what if he’s better than? This is dumb I know because we broke up, but she’ll still call me when she gets off work, or answer when I call her, but she just tells me about the guy, or she could just be talking about anything...But I just see them, and we hang up, and I want to cut, but I don’t. I haven’t cut in about two weeks now, and it’s hard to get over her. Everyone has the one they let get away, and that was mine, and now I just regret not being there for her enough, I don’t know what else I could’ve done though, I only get so much vacation days, and I’m sorta broke all the time...And I want to do something for her but I can’t I just feel so alone and worthless all the time. I keep obsessing over the two of them together, and I just trigger my own panic attacks and I hate this.

Feeling empty,"It's not that I hate working but... no, it is precisely that I hate working. I just can't come to terms with the thought that I'm going to waste a huge part of my life doing things I don't like to do. 
For what? I don't see the point on working hard and achieving all these career goals if the only time I'm going to have to myself would be after I retire — IF I'm ever going to retire and not just drop dead in my 50/60s. 
I'm 27 and I have no idea how to live this life, my supposedly only chance at sentience. I'm depressed due to a lot of things: physical health problems, not being able to find a job that I'm going to at least tolerate, feeling generally lost in life.
I hated all the jobs I've been at, ALL OF THEM. It majorly contributed to my suicidal tendencies and I quit my last job with this awful premonition that if I'm not going to quit asap, I'm going to kill myself. 
My family doesn't understand because 'Everybody's gotta work for a living' (the usual), they kind of resent me now for being like this. I'd gladly drink all the Kool-Aid of this world and be a relatively happy working drone at this point in my life, but my mind just isnt wired that way.
I'm tired of constantly feeling depressed, guilty, angry at this world and myself. I feel absolutely alone, even thought I know that I'm not alone in this type of thinking.
Right now I just feel empty, like there's no way out of this, lile I have nothing to live for.

I'm in a constant struggle between killing myself or doing crack cocaine,"The only good thing in my life is my girlfriend, her whole family (super religious and conservative) and friends hate me and do everything to stop her from being with me, including telling her they have seen me with other girls, a lie of course (her own mother did that).
I was an addict, I did cocaine, crack, benzos. Now I just smoke weed and take LSD occasionally (it actually helps me a lot), also I have tattoos so... the whole combo for them to hate. 
School sucks obviously, I can't concentrate, I disassociate, I feel worthless and tired all the time.

They then basically said coke back in a week and see how you feel. It's like no one even cares if I had concrete plans to kill myself I wouldn't be going to the doctors would I?

Need another perspective?,"I had a depressive episode so I moved back home, and have had depression for years but never confided in anyone. 

My parents are great and caring, and my mom is even a nurse, like 80% of the time they’re great.

But sometimes my mom can bug me.. like in the waiting room at the clinic while waiting to get recommended for a psychiatrist for depression she says: You still have it right?

Like what?! She has a nursing degree and asked that. I mean she’s usually very supportive but just this small thing makes me very confused. I am doing much better now that I have a routine and am not alone and suicidal everyday but just because you don’t see my depression doesn’t mean My depression went away.

I’ve hid it for at least 6 years and i was very good at it. I’m an actor. But it irks me that she would say that.

I’m 19 and sorta tall sometimes when we’re out shopping or something she talks about things that I’d rather not discuss in the middle of the mall, like “oh, yeah we should discuss when you should attend classes,” and we never discuss this at home.

It feels like she’s justifying my presence, like this is why I’m here with my 19 year old son on a Monday shopping and he’s not in school. Honestly it’s embarrassing and even if Im overthinking it I feel anxiety in public and I really don’t like standing out.

I’m pretty sure my depressions from her side of the family as she and her grandmother have had antidepressants. Don’t get me wrong we’re close and I love her, but sometimes it’s very annoying and any constructive criticism I give the way she responds is never in a way that doesn’t make me feel guilty about pointing something out.

Whenever there’s a problem she seems to blow it out of proportion, and I’ve stopped trying to help because if we go down a wrong street I become implicated in the problem and she makes it feel as if the world is ending even though everything works out. 

Sometimes it feels like she lets things go wrong on purpose, I can’t even count the times we have gone out for something and she forgot her bags, or we forgot to bring some package for the post office, or something similar. Whenever this happens she says “oh I should have thought of that” “I’m so stupid” “I should have known” and it makes me feel as if she is expecting me to remind her of these things. I appreciate all the things she does but if it’s something she organizes for example shopping like I have no control over what she forgets to bring but she somehow makes me feel responsible, or at least I do somehow. 

I just can’t understand this negative side to her and it seems like somethings always wrong and if it is she exacerbates it, I can’t tell if it’s from her depression if she has low self esteem and is hard on herself if she makes mistakes or makes mistakes on purpose, regardless it affects me.

I know not everything here was directly about depression but I thought because it relates to my situation might as well say what’s on my mind.

I've been having chronic pain and I'm partially blind,"Hi I'm 23 years old
It was October 2019,
I was having intense headaches and nausea, it was my birthday the 24th. My family thought it was normal because of my period 2 weeks go by the pain is worse and in tense. I was taken to a hospital, and a neurologist saw me and said I had no signs of any problems whatsoever but to make sure he prescribed me declofenac and to get a resonance on my head. 

No tumors where found and the declofenac made my problems worsen, I went to a different hospital where my grandmother sister works as head of emergency and pediatrician. The doctor who attended me stated I was fine and had nothing, I studied for a nursing license and knew the look in the doctors face when I told her I'm still in pain after administrating medication was of ""she just wants drugs"" face. I told my grandmas sister and she told me, that the doctor who attended me they always fight because of her attitude and insinuation on patients. At this time I was already 2 months in pain, my family tried to look for other know neurologist in the field to see what's going on and none of them knew.

3 months I was talking to a friend and just for a moment I felt numb, numb as in I didn't feel any pain. My dad got scared and saw my left eye drift away, he took me to a oftalmologist. He didn't know what's going on when he checked me so he referred me to a hospital specialized in neuro-oftalmologist. I went through the emergency room and I was obviously angry frustrated you name it. The doctor checked my eyes and told me I had papilledema, and it might be cause by the birth control pills since I was always having issues with my hormones. The blood pressured my eyes thus having nausea, headaches, desoroentation, sensitivity to light, and insomnia.

I was treated for papilledema and I can't use any birth control whatsoever, but now I'm still sensitive to light and I see like those huge TVs in the 90s and VHS. Because my left eye was left with nerve damage, I can't see my peripheral view from both my eyes. the left eye its been losing the blur I see and it's getting darker, as in pitch black and have like a 1cm of blurred or I think even less. I'm also not being able to see most colors or differentiate in deepness (as in stairs, steps, holes etc) 

It's been 6 months now..

I changed doctors, learned myself to go through my surroundings without depending in my eye sight. I no longer have papilledema and I still get headaches even when I try to force my eye sigth, plus In December we found out my knees is more above than usual and that's why it pops out. But that time it popped out it didn't went in and now I have to use kinesiology tape to have support and control over it.

I've been snapping at a lot of people degrading me, telling me it's nothing, people are in worse situations be grateful.

But I'm not allowed to snap, I'm not allowed to defend myself, I'm not allowed to call people out when they make me feel like I've literally gone through nothing.

I have no friends, and the people I know don't know my position. Because they literally don't give a sh*T

Im social whenever I can and this was my actual fear losing my eye sight. I'm not afraid of risking it, making hard decisions, animals, crisis. My fear is actually coming true..

How am I not going to feel depressed, sad, upset, angry, frustrated....

HOW?! I literally use the keyboard voice option instead of writing and Google assistant.

help- i need advice,"ive been having a horribly depressed episode for the past 6 months— i am not diagnosed but ive been dealing with casual symptoms of depression for my whole life (im 18).
i finally went to my doctor in january and she gave me a referral to a psychiatrist, but wait lists here are long and its been over a month and i havent heard anything. ill probably be waiting much longer and that thought feels like torture and makes me feel worse.
im self harming, but i personally dont think its at an alarming level. there was about a month long period when i was **actively** suicidal, had a plan, a date, and the tool to do it. obviously i didnt follow through. the thought of suicide still lingers in my mind but its more low-key now...
when i was actively suicidal i was considering voluntary hospitalization. i know that route would get me treatment much quicker.
right now i feel like thats my only option with my current situation... i dont know if this is selfish, but i cant bare the thought of waiting much longer for treatment when ive been having on and off depressive episodes my whole life, and i believe im in the middle of my worst one yet right now.

I have told her about this and we try different things to strengthen the trust again but nothing really works. This is ruining our relationship that was going great until this.

Doesn’t help that my friend is always lying about things (small things at times) and after telling him the situation he hated me and began acting like a dick and showed me a side of him I never knew.

In a pickle of feelings,"I've been in a very relaxed relationship since September but ever since january things have been ""on the wall."" During winter break, especially after the holidays, she became a lil bit distant to me. We eventually talked and she wanted to be apart for awhile due to personal issues with herself and I understood and we went from a relationship to just best friends. We have talked about her issues before so I told her I will always be there for her and she insisted she didnt want things to change or grow apart. We were in a very adult relationship so I didn't want to ruin or friendship, we eventually became close and things were all the same as they were before we broke up. Lately though she has been going through things again and I am having a hard time getting through it this time. Last time I took it very mature and was actually the only relationship I have actually not completely fallen apart after the break up. This time I'm thinking it's just me though and my own low self esteem has caused issues more than anything. I barely get a text from her and we never get to hang out and it really hurts, more than anything I have every felt before. This has resulted in me doing things I have never done before that I feel ashamed of, caused me to take up nicotine again, and major other issues resulting in my school work in college to be a burden rather than something to help me. Sorry I just needed to get some stuff off my chest and things and I hope she never sees any of this. She is an absolute gem and I want to be the one to be there for her as much as I can but I feel like she is hiding from me at times and doesnt want to even deal with me anymore. The only part that give me hope and joy is when I see her in class and we talk and joke, and then I kiss her good bye and I dont see her for another few days. It's just alot of pain to see someone I care about so much just dissapear from my life like this. Or atleast it feels that way if I'm not over thinking it.

I don’t want to say I’ve been emotionally abused, because it’s wasn’t as bad as others and I don’t remember most of it

I don’t want to say I used to cut, because I only did it for a few months

I need advice!,"Hi, so my friend has depression and an eating disorder of some kind. I had depression last year but got out of it and last time I selfharmed was maybe 6 months ago. I and the few people that know about her problems have tried to help her and it helped a little but got bad again. She was one of my bestfriends but she makes me depressed and anxious now and I can’t handel it. But none of the people that she has told can really help her anymore because we are too exhausted and can’t risk our own health. She won’t get professional help and 70% of what she talks about is her bad eating habits or selfharm/depression.

She’s always too close to me and I have said to her that I need my personal space but she doesn’t seem to understand. I want to help her but It’s just too much right now. When we talked about her needing professional help she said that she got professional help but it got too busy just before she could get better. She ment me, I was the ”professional” help. I have been busy so I haven’t talked to her outside of school that much and I just feel like she tried to make me feel bad that she almost got better and then I got busy. Like I can’t use all my free time on you, I have my own problems and life too. She doesn’t respect my boundaries and I feel like she has gotten between me and my bestfriends. I feel like I’m a bad friend but I have to choose my health first. I need some space from her but I can’t get any. I need advice! But remember, if you are depressed please get help and talk to someone, it truly helps. This is why professional help is so good, friends can help to some extent but they aren’t professionals that know how to handel these things in the best way. I just have it hard because I’m still healing and it’s not good for me right now personally.

What should i do. I am sort of bullied at school.,"Hello i am a 12 year old dutch boy. I am the scilent smart kid in class that always get good grades butt also i am not the tipical nerd in class that doesnt do anything but learning no I am in 7th grade and I have a class that is called science but it what i do now is make anything over a bicicle to race with.(It is for the looks) I have a boy who also does that class and we are sort of friends. butt he makes comments like: ""Sytse (my name), You ruined everything."" I really dont like that sort of comments because i am soccially really unstable. I have been trough a lott the last couple of years because my little sister(3 years younger than me) was alway angry. That really effected me. Also other classmates will kick me and i know it is al yokes en stuff but i really dont like that and i haven't been happy for a long time. when i am home is it also always that i am really tired. The only things that give me energy are drawing alone locked up in my room and watching youtube wit h my earbuds in. it also doesnt help that my little sister is really adhd or something. i mean REALLY ADHD. it isnt normal. and i cant have any attention because she always has something my parents have to see. My parents are the best, dont get me wrong butt i really dont know what to do. also i havent shared this story to anyone ever. my parents tell me that i seem depressed. It hasnt been proved yet but i am just not happy all the time. Not in school, not at home. the only thing that gives me some sort of energy is drawing. i can do that all day long.

Feeling below average,"This feeling comes and goes and I usually keep it suppressed by submerging myself in mundane stuff. I am 34 years old and I have been dealing with these episodes of worthlessness since probably middle school. I grew up in a small rural town in Puerto Rico. I can’t say we all know each other, but everyone knows everyone else’s business. 

I  grew up in a  strict pentecostal family with many rules forced into my siblings and I. We used to go to church usually 7 days a week and on Sundays twice (Bible school in the morning and afternoon/evening service).  Secular music was prohibited and any tv material that was deemed “demonic” by the pastor. 

Of course, living in a pentecostal family made a huge impact on who I was from elementary school all the way until I decided to part ways with the faith later on in my 20s. I was so insecure about myself and tried super hard to fit in with the other kids. It was a challenge because I never felt understood by the others, mainly because I had nothing to relate with them. I was not allowed to listen to secular music or even go to the movies because of rules my mom enforced on all of us. 

That insecurity grew even stronger when entered high school, which of course was the worse years of my teenage years. There were so many things happening in my life at that moment that I thought in some weird way it was all normal. 

During the last years of elementary school my dad decided to distance himself from church. He became an alcoholic shortly after and everything went downhill from there. He multiple affairs that my mom was ware of and that didn’t turned out well for me. My mom became aggressive and depressed. I used to get hit for no reason that I can remember to this day.

I think she felt trapped because divorcing my father was not an option due to her fanaticism. My mom used to break stuff every day, scream and yell, stayed inside her room all day and praying for the most part. One positive thing I can say about her is that we were never hungry and somehow she always found ways to provide us with clothes and food. 

My dad disappeared for many months one time and I thought he gave up on us but specially on me. I felt so betrayed by him. My mom was also non-present in my life or school. My grades dropped drastically and I was bullied a lot at school for being alone the majority of the time. 

There is so much to say about everything that happened but, I thought I was over that and everything that happened. Today I am angry at my parents because how irresponsible they were with their kids. I compare myself to every one else around me and I feel like I should’ve had a better upbringing. I know it’s up to me know and they are no longer responsible but it still hurts me so much. 

I deal with my insecurities every day and that is something I’m never gonna be able to change. I compare myself a lot with everyone.  I tend to feel like a way lesser version of whoever I am comparing myself to. I’m going to therapy and that helps to a degree. I just wish I could find people or at least someone that can relate to this.

I feel like my life is going no where,"And I don’t know where to begin
Words used to come naturally 
And now they feel dead. 

So I’m not going to try. 

I don’t know where my life is going and I don’t know why I am here. Things seem to be spinning out of control and I just don’t know how to stop things from moving. I got fired from my job for being sick, for being chronically ill. I’m doing the best I can, and being sick never effected my work performance. I belong in a hospital — but not as a patient. I am supposed to be a nurse now—I am 24. I was dead set on nursing school from the time I was a little girl. I’m supposed to be making little kids laugh as chemo flows into their veins. But no. I have a port a cath myself and nursing school seems so far away. I don’t know what I am doing. I don’t know what is going on in my relationship ship. I don’t know what is going on with my body. I go to the Mayo Clinic in two weeks so they can see what the fuck is wrong with me. I just feel like I have no control and I don’t know which way to turn. I’m trying my hardest to get through. I feel like I have no direction. Next week I don’t have any work lined up and then the week after I go to mayo. Alone. And I am starting to freak out. I mean I have traveled alone before, many times. But this is different. I am going to be poked and prodded and scanned and all of these things and I’m scared. And I will be alone. My boyfriend, who lives with me, but am now in an open relationship with and he came out as bisexual recently and we are slowly drifting apart so he can see what living life as a bi/gay man is like, will experience what it is like to be alone.

Turning 31 soon...is it worth trying to make something of myself?,"I'm almost 31 and a nurse. I own my own home in a capital city in Australia and have roughly 2/3 of the mortgage paid off. Despite these successes, I feel like a failure. I've pretty much lived my whole adult life in a way that is completely inauthentic to how I really feel inside. It's like I haven't let myself free in any way.

I always wanted to be a translator of Japanese, but I chose nursing because it was much more stable and I lacked confidence. In my early 20s I had an ED and I let guys use me for sex (I've only slept with 4 people but looking back I don't think I wanted to sleep with any of them). I used to have a nice slim figure but I've put on a few pounds from binge eating (not fat) and I'm working on losing it. I have pretty much no friends and don't really socialise outside work. I can't drive. I haven't had sex since I was 24. I've never had what you would call a proper, grown-up relationship.

I am thinking about learning a language in the hopes of changing career, but I feel like a total loser. Being 31, I feel like I'm 'over the hill' and there's no chance for me to become proficient in a skill or to succeed. I feel like no-one cares what I do, I could literally just live in my house with my cats getting fatter and fatter until I died. I seem to be obsessing over a guy who used me pretty badly at university who got married to a ballet dancer recently. I keep thinking, there's a quality woman, she's so talented, I'll never be talented like that. What's the point?

Basically I am in an anxious spiral...can anyone snap me out of this depressed thinking? I know I sound really pathetic and self-pitying, and that's because I am.",tokyospirit89,4,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/fdx6qy/turning_31_soonis_it_worth_trying_to_make/,almost 31 nurse home capital city australia roughly 2 3 mortgage paid despite success feel like failure pretty much lived whole adult life way completely inauthentic really feel inside like let free way always wanted translator japanese chose nursing wa much stable lacked confidence early 20 ed let guy use sex slept 4 people looking back think wanted sleep used nice slim figure put pound binge eating fat working losing pretty much friend really socialise outside work drive sex since wa 24 never would call proper grown relationship thinking learning language hope changing career feel like total loser 31 feel like hill chance become proficient skill succeed feel like one care could literally live house cat getting fatter fatter died seem obsessing guy used pretty badly university got married ballet dancer recently keep thinking quality woman talented never talented like point basically anxious spiral anyone snap depressed thinking know sound really pathetic self pitying,turning 31 soon worth trying make something,tokyo spirit 89,1669,65,tokyo spirit 89 almost 31 nurse home capital city australia roughly 2 3 mortgage paid despite success feel like failure pretty much lived whole adult life way completely inauthentic really feel inside like let free way always wanted translator japanese chose nursing wa much stable lacked confidence early 20 ed let guy use sex slept 4 people looking back think wanted sleep used nice slim figure put pound binge eating fat working losing pretty much friend really socialise outside work drive sex since wa 24 never would call proper grown relationship thinking learning language hope changing career feel like total loser 31 feel like hill chance become proficient skill succeed feel like one care could literally live house cat getting fatter fatter died seem obsessing guy used pretty badly university got married ballet dancer recently keep thinking quality woman talented never talented like point basically anxious spiral anyone snap depressed thinking know sound really pathetic self pitying turning 31 soon worth trying make something
wish someone would bring me chinese food and stroke my hair while i cry,"i am feeling very, very bad right now. suicidal i guess. more like passively wishing i would slip into death with no effort or suffering on my part. i’ve suffered enough. 

i feel like right now is the first time all week my brain has had to pause and process or actually feel something and it’s just aggressively hitting me with all the depression i’ve been stuffing down throughout the week when i didn’t have time for it. well, now i do. so here it is. 

i tried journaling. i ended up just listing ways i could kill myself right now while i’m home alone. (not gonna. wish i would, or could, but i won’t. not now). tried meditating. couldn’t focus on it or let the calm penetrate the surface. i looked at my dog and immediately started sobbing, thinking about him living without me. 

i wanted to get some fresh air and let him run around, so i let him outside and sat on the front steps. he ended up sitting right next to me. wouldn’t leave my side. i looked up and saw the moon (it was still daylight) and began crying again. my dog kept nudging me to keep a hand on him and pushing against me. it made me cry more. i talked aloud to the moon. to whatever is out there. to my late mom. begged whoever was listening to please just help me. ease the pain. do something. i do not want to do this anymore. 

sat there for a while and watched the moon move in the sky behind the bare tree branches. felt the cold air seep down to my bones. it felt good. felt good to feel something that wasn’t sadness. it calmed me down. at this point i just feel numb. back to autopilot, i guess. better than life-shatteringly sad, right? 

i wish i could tell someone “i’m feeling suicidal” and they’d drop everything to bring me chinese food and rub my back. without me saying another word. that’s what i want. ridiculous, right? but instead i tell people that and then push them away. or i don’t tell them at all. or i give subtle hints and they are completely ignored. 

actually, i wish the aid of other people would help me at all. i THINK having someone support me in this way or love me or kiss my wounds would fix it all, but it wouldn’t. i’m just terrified of the thought of dealing with this alone for another single second. i am terrified of myself. of my brain. of my sickness. my trauma. my darkness. i want someone else to come pick up all the pieces and feed me chinese food and rub my back while they do it. 

if only.

Was I depressed?,"In 2014, I first entered university and encountered a lot of changes: new people, new environment, new classes, and so on.

At the time, I had a lot of acne, which prevented me from meeting people. Furthermore, I had an identity crisis and started asking fundamental questions of life such as: ""who am I? why am I here? where do I go?"", and constantly thought about life and death. I wanted to harm myself and other people because I was in such a lonely, miserable spot when everyone else looked so happy. This lasted a few months. 

In between, I picked up lifting weights, practiced meditation, and my acne cleared up. 

Fast forward 5 years, I am completely happy. I have good friends, a good relationship with my family, and I have a stable career. Since my environment improved, my negative thoughts subsided. But I know that depressions don't go away with time, and that's what I'm worried about.

Depression and the people who treat it,"I have to get this off my chest or I’m going to go off on someone. So as you can read back through my posts, I was doing Spravato for a very short time before my insurance pulled the rug out from me. Two weeks into it, that’s right - TWO WEEKS, Insurance comes back after pre-approving my treatment and says since I had not shown a 50% improvement they were denying any further treatments. Thanks for the warning fuckers! So of course my depression and anxiety dropped severely after this happened. Partly because of being pissed and irate and outright shocked about how they could even do this. And second, my body and mind didn’t care for how I just suddenly stopped treatments. So I’ve been on a downward spiral for about two weeks now. 
Well the clinic where I was having the treatments has not really got back to me and kind of dropped me like a bad habit now that they aren’t getting money from my insurance. When the lady called to tell me she said she would talk to the dr in charge of the program and ask him what he wanted to do. That was almost two weeks ago. I’ve spoke to her once since and tried calling several times with no call back. Like seriously ... What the fuck? You have someone who was telling you I was severely depressed and suicidal (enough to get approved for disability - which is not easy to do!) and you’re just gonna fucking ignore my calls and my concerns and let me go to the wayside? What happened to checking with the dr to ask him about a next step? Is that it? Is it just like - well no more Spravato for you so we are done dealing with you?! I’m fed the fuck up quite honestly. And after waiting all week since talking to her Monday, I’m going to call tomorrow and I’m asking to speak to a supervisor or someone in charge of that fucking place. Let me just add also that when I first contacted them to set up my initial appointment, it took almost two months before I got in there! That’s right! Two months! It was the beginning of December when I first called and someone was supposed to call me back and I waited and waited and finally called and went off asking them “do I have to say I’m suicidal before someone will take me seriously and call me back??” It was soon after I finally got in there but to me that’s a little ridiculous to think of making a suicidal person wait almost two months to start treatment or be evaluated. 
Between that and the insurance screwing me, I’m truly and utterly fed up. It makes me sick and pissed off how the system fails people like me and then they wonder why mental illness is such an issue and has such a stigma around it! Well no fucking wonder. If others are treated anything like I have been, and I have a feeling that many are, then I can see why people lose their shit and either end up killing them selves or others. Let me clarify - I’m NOT in any way condoning that behavior or saying it’s okay. I’m simply saying that it’s no wonder there’s such an issue with mental illness in this county. 
All that being said, where does one go from here? I’ve tried therapists, countless medicines, obviously the Spravato - all to come to this. To pretty much be treated as if my life means nothing and completely and utterly ignored! I hate to sound narcissistic, but god damn. My life should be just as important as anyone else’s. 
Here’s the conclusion I’ve pretty much come to in the last 24 hours. I have to stop depending on anyone to help me deal with this fucking sickness. I have to depend on myself to somehow get better. I am the only one who is here for me. Nobody else gives a fuck. Nobody. Why should they? They have nothing invested in me and I mean nothing. If they aren’t getting money from insurance then why bother even returning my phone call right? 
I don’t know. If this is what our society has come to, I seriously want no part of it anymore. It’s disgusting and I am to the point where I hate people in general. I know that sounds bad, but go back up and re-read my post if you really want to try to understand why I am starting to hate people. I wasn’t always this way. Yes, I’ve dealt with mental illness most my life in some capacity or another. But here in the last 5 years it has hit the absolute bottom of the bottom. I look back at times when I thought I was depressed before and I think to myself - I’d give anything to go back to that time and redo things. 
I don’t really have anything else to say. I’ve rambled on enough. I just had to get this all out in some way. If you made it to this and have read my whole post then thank you. You’ve shown more concern than the people who claimed to be there for me and deal with my depression - until the insurance money stopped

Does anyone else feel alone even when surrounded by people?,"Things that didn't bother me in the past are now sending me into a deep depression. You know when you're talking to someone about something you're passionate about, but they just dont care? You know when that seems to happen with every interest and every person? Thats happening to me constantly lately. I guess it always did but I didnt think about it so hard in the past. Now it just makes me feel so alone. I can be talking and bubbly and I mention an interest and the person i'm talking to just nods in feign interest. If its over text its just stuff like ""wow"",  ""nice"",  ""lol"",  ""cool"". You can just tell they arent interested because as soon as the topic changes they are so much more involved. Honestly its making me feel so bitter, it feels like no one cares enough to try and get involved with the interests which mean the most to me. I can be surrounded by people but I feel so alone because I know no one cares. I know no one cares about me. No one cares about my interests. Honestly its just gotten really sad. Out of context this can sound so selfish but I just compare it to myself - when I know someone I love is deeply interested in something I try my hardest to see what they see when they look at it. I even try to get into it myself. Whereas I bring anything up about myself and they say one worded responses just trying to get me to move on. I don't know.

Can't Trust My Girrlfriend When I'm Depressed,"Hello all, 

Using a throwaway account, but I frequent this sub on my main account. Anyway, I need some advice. I can't trust my girlfriend when I'm depressed. The both of us deal with anxiety and depression, but she doesnt seem to get me when I'm depressed. Don't get me wrong, we both have our faults, but we always do our best to understand each other and walk through hard times with one another. However,  the last two times that I have been very depressed, she ended up pushing me away when I needed her the most. About a month ago she got very upset with me that she walked over to me and angrily accused me of not showing enough attention to our relationship. I had a family member pass just a few weeks before, and I think it was finally getting to me. I apologized, told her that I'm depressed, saying that I wish I could be doing better. I told her that I was depressed and she walked away, angry, slamming the door behind her. The person that I love the most turned her back on me when I needed her the most. I went for a walk, we messaged each other, and she asked me to come back. She was crying so much, I felt bad. She felt terrible for not listening to me. This wasn't the first time that something like this has happened though. When I am depressed, she pushes me away.

"I was dead years ago, I'm just catching up","I give up.  I have been over life since I was a teenager and I'm not doing a good enough job hiding it anymore.  My boss even pulled me aside with concerns. 


""When I was interviewing you you had the best interview I'd ever seen. Where is that guy? You miss work, you're emotional, you have lost all your passion"" 

My mother can't even talk to me without me going into tears over being the worst son ever. She hasn't said anything to that effect but does notes that I'm not eating. Not doing anything anymore. When I'm off work I end up spending hours just staring at the walls and I'll find myself crying although I don't know what for. She doesn't visit my home as often anymore.

I feel like I'm starting to slip and it's too much. When I could hide it it was fine because I didn't have to explain anything to anyone, but having people ask me directly why I'm malnourished and lost a lot of weight is leading to outbursts I can't control anymore.  

I was keeping it together pretty well for about 30 years but in the last 2 years my entire friend groupEnded up moving away or finding their own lives all at about the same timeAnd since then I've not really had any contact With other people outside of work 
. I'm glad I was able to keep it together until everyone found their own happiness so I avoided being a burden to them. so I feel like it's as good a time as any to have me just quietly disappear
 I don't know how to tell everybody that the guy that they thought they knew was an act and never existed in the 1st place. I feel darker and darker thoughts more and more often lately and I would honestly be terrified to actually hurt somebody else. And I guess I just wish that there was some safe in easy way out of life because I don't really deserve it.  

Who could possibly go through another 30 years of this shit? How is it that I am the crazy one for not wanting that?

Identity and being suicidal,"My problem started about 4 years ago.  Generally, I am a calm person - an introvert (more ambivalent), I liked being with myself, I liked to help, I was quite specific, very empathetic, although I stayed with other normal cool people.  I couldn't be a dick.
 Over time, I noticed that I stand out.  Others went somewhere, spent time, etc. Problems started in high school when it came to partying, crazy outings.  Everyone snapped, told their exits as if it was unknown.  And I didn't have anyone but one friend.  I found that something was wrong with me and I began to change.  I wanted to reprogram, upload other more extroverted software.  At that time I had a completely distorted picture of reality.  And for example - I have always been balanced and did not make quick, ill-considered decisions.  Seeing that others don't do it, I suppressed it and added it to my new ""software"".  Seeing that others do not respond immediately to the huts also so began to do.  These small, seemingly low risk examples have changed me.  There were plenty of them.  I did so with everything.  I know it's sick but it was so.  I began to think what other people's lives were like.  I wanted to experience these beautiful moments that I heard and told them myself.  It lasted a long time.  My current personality was changed.  I copied every behavior and thinking patterns of the ""better"" ones I took an example of. After half a year, I got depressed. I felt terrible. Memory loss, pits. I realized what I had done and wanted to unprogram. I began to think, I analyzed my personality a lot  , what should change, how to behave and feel. I tried to remember my previous identity. I had so many copied habits that I didn't know how to behave, feel, think. I didn't feel like myself, as if unreal, in a dream, without contact  with feelings, emotions.
 The situation continues to this day.  I do not know who I am.  I don't feel anything, I don't feel myself.
 The only thing keeping me alive is the awareness that it used to be good and it's all in my head.  I often have thoughts of suicide.
 I have sick thoughts - I classify people according to their qualities that are useful and not, I divide people into better and worse.  I do not feel anything.
 Not once during these 4 years did I feel alive.  No sadness, no shot of joy, no intense feeling.
 He constantly compares himself to others.  I do not know how to be myself - I look at others, I wonder what they feel, how they think, what chances I would face against them.  The psychologist and therapy did nothing.  Now he keeps in touch with a psychologist who tells me to stop thinking and follow my feelings
 I try to do it but I still want to write it.  I feel lost.  The only thing keeping me alive is reason.  Nothing else.  He tells me he thinks it all.  I don't remember what it's like to be happy.  I do not know who I am.

Beauty and the Beast but I'm the Beast?,"My partner is the most happy, positive, loving person in the world. I have never met anyone like him, he's so special and he makes me feel things I've never felt before. But it kills me how much shit I put him through all the time. He sees me when I'm depressed and it hurts him, and I lash out on him because I'm not feeling well and I have mood swings. And somehow it bothers me even more that he doesn't mind, he doesn't get offended or angry, I could be absolutely horrible to him and he would just show me endless love and try to comfort me and reassure me he's where he wants to be.

I know I should be happy, but it bothers me so much. I'm constantly tormented by feeling like an awful person for doing mean things to someone so amazing. A little voice in my head never stops telling me he deserves better and I would be doing him a favour if I broke up with him. Yeah, he would be hurt for a little while, but he'd get over me and then he could find someone who treats him the way he should be treated. I wish I could treat him right but I feel like I have no control over my mood swings.

There's also a selfish part of me that thinks I would feel better if I broke up with him and didn't have to feel so guilty all the time. I feel like I'm going to end up ruining him, he's so positive and he brightens up every room he's in, but what if my sadness rubs off on him? I'd be hurt too if we split up but I deserve that, he doesn't deserve a monster like me.

That's it, I just kind of wanted to get this off my chest.

Went to a psychiatrist,"This morning my mom took me to a psychiatrist appointment I’ve been waiting for for months. Immediately, he began questioning why I was there when I had good grades in school and seemed fine. Also asked if I was restless all the time and I said yes, and he told me no I wasn’t because I wasn’t fidgeting at that point (even though I was shaking and playing with my Kleenex) Then my mom mentioned the eating disorder clinic I’ve been going to and he asked my bmi and I’m not allowed to know it, so he made me stand up and started patting me down to get a “feel for my weight”. By this point I was crying and he just continued to make me feel like I was faking it or shouldn’t be there. It took me 6 years to speak up about this and now I’m regretting it because I always feared I would be told that I was overreacting or faking it. Was uncomfortable the whole time too because he was sitting with like less than a metre between us and. I have to go see him again in a few weeks and I’m so terrified, I’m still crying and it’s been 3 hours.

Do I even want help?,"I reached out yesterday... I called 111. I needed to. But now, am I glad I did or do I regret it?

 Depression at varying degrees has been my state of existence for so long, I don't know who I am without it. Yes, I have good times that are not as bad... But they are short-lived. Fleeting.

I last had medical help a few years ago. Therapy and meds helped. Therapy ended... Then I missed an appointment for a med check and I don't reschedule when that happens... I don't want to waste anyone's time.

My state was tolerable. Manageable. I stopped self harming more than a year and a half ago. I'm proud of that, even if that long stretch came from a bad relapse... I don't want to ruin it now. I really don't.

The thing is, my mental state has been deteriorating over the past few months... Year? More? I don't even know... Occasional thoughts of hurting myself I can ignore and move on from. But they, like the happy times, are usually fleeting. As are worse thoughts. Now... It's persistent. And fighting it is exhausting. Reached a point yesterday where I honestly did not feel safe. So I called. 111 put me onto the rapid response team. Had a meeting today. Have a doctor's appointment tomorrow. Have to see them ever day for a little under two weeks.

But that doesn't stop the thoughts... I feel guilty because I feel like I'm taking valuable resources away from someone else who needs them. But I'm also worried... I lose chunks of time... My memory is crap and I can forget things minutes later sometimes (it's intermittent)... I have no energy or drive to do... Anything... I can't focus on conversations and constantly have to ask people to repeat themselves. I've been getting persistent chest pains and my vision is just... Weird. I can't explain completely. And I'm constantly fighting the need to do... Something. I need to hurt. But I can't let myself. And it's exhausting.

So all these strategies coming in and I keep asking myself... I don't even want help. Or do I? I don't know. I know I reached out and I know I can't keep doing this without professional help.

I've finally accepted that I'm a fucking failure.,"I'm at my 3rd job in my field out of grad. The first lasted 3 months before they told me it wasn't working out, the second lasted 7 months before they told me I was slipping, and this one just ended today with a phone call at a mere 2 months. I don't know if I can make myself go on. I don't know where else to go, my skills weren't good enough, and it was a specialized field. I was too quiet for something too client-oriented and it translated to having terrible communication skills that I can't get over. My peers are all going to hear about this, it's a small field and you tend to see everyone in the same industry at conferences, two of them worked at that first job and are heavy gossipers and they'll probably tell everyone there what happened and they'll feel that happy schadenfreude that I was a fucking failure, another piece of conversation fodder to laugh about. I have my other classmates on social media and they post about how great it is to be in that field, and some of them share the same interests as I do so I'll likely run into them again at fan-related events. They say that you shouldn't care about what other people think but easier said than done. I can't face them again and I can't face myself either. The only thing keeping me alive is the fact that the options I've run through in my brain haven't been ideal, painless or with a high success rate as well as my cowardice so I guess I'll still be miserably alive until I find something suitable.",niricia,0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/fe63p8/ive_finally_accepted_that_im_a_fucking_failure/,3rd job field grad first lasted 3 month told working second lasted 7 month told wa slipping one ended today phone call mere 2 month know make go know else go skill good enough wa specialized field wa quiet something client oriented translated terrible communication skill get peer going hear small field tend see everyone industry conference two worked first job heavy gossiper probably tell everyone happened feel happy schadenfreude wa fucking failure another piece conversation fodder laugh classmate social medium post great field share interest likely run fan related event say care people think easier said done face face either thing keeping alive fact option run brain ideal painless high success rate well cowardice guess still miserably alive find something suitable,finally accepted fucking failure,nir ici,1476,49,nir ici 3rd job field grad first lasted 3 month told working second lasted 7 month told wa slipping one ended today phone call mere 2 month know make go know else go skill good enough wa specialized field wa quiet something client oriented translated terrible communication skill get peer going hear small field tend see everyone industry conference two worked first job heavy gossiper probably tell everyone happened feel happy schadenfreude wa fucking failure another piece conversation fodder laugh classmate social medium post great field share interest likely run fan related event say care people think easier said done face face either thing keeping alive fact option run brain ideal painless high success rate well cowardice guess still miserably alive find something suitable finally accepted fucking failure

My dog just pulled me out of a funk,"Hi guys. I've been struggling with a relapse into severe depression for the last couple of months. I've been seeing a psychiatrist who has changed me onto new meds, and I'm slowly starting to come good, but the last couple of days I've been in a deep funk, just not interested in doing anything, not eating, barely talking. I've spent most of my time in bed, or watching youtube, or both. I don't know if it's the change in meds (probably) or what, but I wanted to share a ridiculous moment I just had. 

My dog (a 5yo kelpie named Max) walked into my room, and nudged his butt against my knee like he does when he wants pats. I wasn't feeling it, and nudged him away. He came back, sat down on my foot, and let rip with a huge fart. Right on my foot. I started laughing - I haven't laughed in the last couple of days - and I kept laughing for a solid five minutes. I opened the window to clear the air (also haven't opened the window in the last couple of days) and all of a sudden the funk was over. It was like he poured cold water over my head and my vision cleared. I'm sitting at my desk in the fresh air, still smiling, and about to start on some uni work I have to get a jump on.  Max is napping on my bed like the champion he is.

Things can be so dark for so long that it can be hard to imagine anything different. I don't know what your version of your dog farting on your foot is, but when it comes, try to let it pull you out of the funk. I'm not well yet, and probably won't be back to normal for another month or so, but I'm getting there.",clairewil,0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/fe5zer/my_dog_just_pulled_me_out_of_a_funk/,hi guy struggling relapse severe depression last couple month seeing psychiatrist ha changed onto new med slowly starting come good last couple day deep funk interested anything eating barely talking spent time bed watching youtube know change med probably wanted share ridiculous moment dog 5yo kelpie named max walked room nudged butt knee like doe want pat feeling nudged away came back sat foot let rip huge fart right foot started laughing laughed last couple day kept laughing solid five minute opened window clear air also opened window last couple day sudden funk wa wa like poured cold water head vision cleared sitting desk fresh air still smiling start uni work get jump max napping bed like champion thing dark long hard imagine anything different know version dog farting foot come try let pull funk well yet probably back normal another month getting,dog pulled funk,claire wil,1554,35,claire wil hi guy struggling relapse severe depression last couple month seeing psychiatrist ha changed onto new med slowly starting come good last couple day deep funk interested anything eating barely talking spent time bed watching youtube know change med probably wanted share ridiculous moment dog 5yo kelpie named max walked room nudged butt knee like doe want pat feeling nudged away came back sat foot let rip huge fart right foot started laughing laughed last couple day kept laughing solid five minute opened window clear air also opened window last couple day sudden funk wa wa like poured cold water head vision cleared sitting desk fresh air still smiling start uni work get jump max napping bed like champion thing dark long hard imagine anything different know version dog farting foot come try let pull funk well yet probably back normal another month getting dog pulled funk

Totally burned out and extrem depressed,"So im going to tell you a „little“ about my Situation. I am usually a pretty happy Person. I like doing fun Things like going out with Friends who ive known pretty much all my life (im 23 ) and i have a passion which Is Film making. But Since i started with school even at a Young age i always had Problems concentrating and focusing at School it just isnt for me because I don’t see the benefits from it. I also think the school system is extremly outdated. Last September I started my education ( I live in Germany and the English word for ausbildung translates to education.. ) I work in a world known firm which im not going to name because of a couple of reasons which aren’t related to my problem though. I would say it’s pretty fun because all of my co workers and bosses are pretty nice and always want me to succeed and do good. I’m also pretty good at this job. Even though I got a lot for me going in this particular job I don’t really see me self working in this job for the rest of my life. I’d rather make a living doing films. But I could imagine working for a few years while working for my dream and that’s not a problem. But school is a major problem for me (in Germany you have to go to school while being in Vocational training, another word for the German word Ausbildung) it’s not that easy and I am literally crying everyday that I come from school ( School is 2 times a week ) I can’t concentrate well in school and I miss a lot of school material while trying to focus on a topic. When I have to write an exam I become depressed as f*ck from Studying. Everytime I Imagine working or having school I have suicidal thoughts and can’t get out of my bed for days sometimes. These thoughts are sometimes so bad, I imagine myself to end it all.. I also have a girlfriend which is my biggest supporter and the best human you could ever imagine. She gives everything trying to cheer me up and help me with my problems while working a 9 to 5 job. We want to marry and this is why I even got this job. Because of cultural reasons her family won’t let her get married unless her future husband gets a “secured” Vocational training in case something happens in life that I have something to fall back on. Me and her have the same outlook on this “cultured” living, it’s f*ckin stupid. I can understand her parents as well but it’s just that I am at a totally burned out point in my life that I can’t get motivated to finish this all. I don’t know what I can do to make my life easier.",[deleted],0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/fe0no3/totally_burned_out_and_extrem_depressed/,im going tell little situation usually pretty happy person like fun thing like going friend ive known pretty much life im 23 passion film making since started school even young age always problem concentrating focusing school isnt see benefit also think school system extremly outdated last september started education live germany english word ausbildung translates education work world known firm im going name couple reason related problem though would say pretty fun co worker boss pretty nice always want succeed good also pretty good job even though got lot going particular job really see self working job rest life rather make living film could imagine working year working dream problem school major problem germany go school vocational training another word german word ausbildung easy literally cry everyday come school school 2 time week concentrate well school miss lot school material trying focus topic write exam become depressed f ck studying everytime imagine working school suicidal thought get bed day sometimes thought sometimes bad imagine end also girlfriend biggest supporter best human could ever imagine give everything trying cheer help problem working 9 5 job want marry even got job cultural reason family let get married unless future husband get secured vocational training case something happens life something fall back outlook cultured living f ckin stupid understand parent well totally burned point life get motivated finish know make life easier,totally burned extrem depressed,deleted,2497,39,deleted im going tell little situation usually pretty happy person like fun thing like going friend ive known pretty much life im 23 passion film making since started school even young age always problem concentrating focusing school isnt see benefit also think school system extremly outdated last september started education live germany english word ausbildung translates education work world known firm im going name couple reason related problem though would say pretty fun co worker boss pretty nice always want succeed good also pretty good job even though got lot going particular job really see self working job rest life rather make living film could imagine working year working dream problem school major problem germany go school vocational training another word german word ausbildung easy literally cry everyday come school school 2 time week concentrate well school miss lot school material trying focus topic write exam become depressed f ck studying everytime imagine working school suicidal thought get bed day sometimes thought sometimes bad imagine end also girlfriend biggest supporter best human could ever imagine give everything trying cheer help problem working 9 5 job want marry even got job cultural reason family let get married unless future husband get secured vocational training case something happens life something fall back outlook cultured living f ckin stupid understand parent well totally burned point life get motivated finish know make life easier totally burned extrem depressed
"Days Like Today are the Days I wonder what the point is to carry on... :,(","I didn't sleep for shit again last night. Since I started taking Cymbalta, I have been having insomnia, even when I take melatonin. I miss sleep so much. Restful sleep... and my sex drive... thats just fucking gone. 

Work sucked so much today. One of the managers has an axe to grind with me it seems like and questioned what I was doing. I have been working for this company for almost four years and I know what I am doing. Then when I answered him he went and followed up with the other person to make sure I was telling the truth. I have never been dishonest with anyone at work so that really pissed me off and hurt my feelings. I am so tired of not being trusted. I once got accused of stealing $5k at a credit union I worked at long ago. I was never charged because I didn't do it and they couldn't prove it. I didn't do it and I don't know if they ever found out who did but it caused me a lot of hurt and grief. It is one of the worst feelings having everyone think you are something, like a theif, when you are far from it. I am still trying to lose that 50 pounds I gained from that bout of depression. I think my managers bullshit today stirred that shit up. 

I am simply exisiting today. I hurt everywhere. I dont feel like there really is any point to life anymore. I havent been happy for a long time. Ive tried medication. Ive been staying active om top of my already incredibly phyiscal job (i work in a warehouse). I dont have many friends anymore... my family is super negative.... im very much just going through the  motions and i ak so tired of it. I dont know how to be happy anymore. :,(",boopedya,3,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/fe2m8p/days_like_today_are_the_days_i_wonder_what_the/,sleep shit last night since started taking cymbalta insomnia even take melatonin miss sleep much restful sleep sex drive thats fucking gone work sucked much today one manager ha axe grind seems like questioned wa working company almost four year know answered went followed person make sure wa telling truth never dishonest anyone work really pissed hurt feeling tired trusted got accused stealing 5k credit union worked long ago wa never charged prove know ever found caused lot hurt grief one worst feeling everyone think something like theif far still trying lose 50 pound gained bout depression think manager bullshit today stirred shit simply exisiting today hurt everywhere dont feel like really point life anymore havent happy long time ive tried medication ive staying active om top already incredibly phyiscal job work warehouse dont many friend anymore family super negative im much going motion ak tired dont know happy anymore,day like today day wonder point carry,boo pedy,1613,74,boo pedy sleep shit last night since started taking cymbalta insomnia even take melatonin miss sleep much restful sleep sex drive thats fucking gone work sucked much today one manager ha axe grind seems like questioned wa working company almost four year know answered went followed person make sure wa telling truth never dishonest anyone work really pissed hurt feeling tired trusted got accused stealing 5k credit union worked long ago wa never charged prove know ever found caused lot hurt grief one worst feeling everyone think something like theif far still trying lose 50 pound gained bout depression think manager bullshit today stirred shit simply exisiting today hurt everywhere dont feel like really point life anymore havent happy long time ive tried medication ive staying active om top already incredibly phyiscal job work warehouse dont many friend anymore family super negative im much going motion ak tired dont know happy anymore day like today day wonder point carry
Maybe its for the best that I don't live anymore,"I am almost 40, on disability morbidly obese and can't lose weight no matter how hard I try.   I am almost 40, with nothing but a 500 dollar laptop that my neighbor gave me that is falling apart and only worth around 70 if that. a pair of shoes that are falling apart and hurt when I walk in them. about a dozen worn-out socks and a few shirts and pants all black. mostly sweat pants and two pairs of blue jeans and a worn-out wallet that is falling apart on me. 

I am on disability getting less than 800$ USD a month and have no educational background no GED was homeless for over 8 years and have bad teeth because of it. some need fixing and one needs a new crown. I wasn't taught dental hygiene until I became homeless and even then brushing and flossing was the least of my worries. it was more of getting food and trying to survive. 

I spent the past few years trying to get my GED and failed even with tutors and teachers and study groups found out I have learning issues that make it hard for me to get my GED and I basically have to go from the 2nd and 3rd grade to 12th grade in every subject.

I have no family, no friends. I am utterly alone in this world. Bought a car two years ago was my first car and was planning on living in it but got scammed out of 3k. been trying to save again for another car to live in but been unable to. 

Renting a bedroom from an elderly woman with bad health and she is going in for surgery today if she doesn't make it I will be homeless again nowhere to live and unable to survive being homeless this time. My body has arthritis in my lower back, rheumatoid arthritis in my knees and feet. there's days that I just can't get out of bed because of it hurting so badly. there is no way I can survive being on the streets again.

I feel like complete and utter crap especially compared to everyone else and now realizing how worthless I am in life and maybe it is for the best I just don't live anymore. I have nothing in this world to live for other than myself and even then I don't care to do that anymore. nothing in my life will get better. 

I applied for HUD housing and was supposed to move into my own apartment after 7 years of waiting on the list for over 40 hud housing I got accepted to one but I couldn't make it there as I had no money to get there or for first months rent, downpayment, or to have the lights turned on. 

I spent the past ten years trying to better my life but only to get knocked down every time I get up. For example. saved 3 to 4 years up to 3k and bought my first car then got scammed by the dealership. Resaved money up to 900 dollars then needed two teeth pulled which cost 450 each after tax which drained my 900 I had saved last month after almost a year of saving. Then I got called up for my first apartment ever and couldn't get there. 

Two years ago needed eye surgery to remove a cataract in my right eye and now need it done in my left eye but the Dr refuses and now Texas is doing this Real ID stuff where you need a star on your driver license and in order to do that I need an eye exam and I will most likely fail it and lose my driver license because of the cataract in my left eye so there goes the driver license and there goes getting a car to live in. 

Spent years trying to get my GED only to fail it every time I try. spent the past eight years in the dating scene only to get rejected by women over my weight and told I am worthless and have nothing to offer a relationship or just downright mocked at and laughed at over my weight.

I got the cataracts in my eyes from taking Androgel testosterone medication because I have very low testosterone and I am on thyroid meds because my thyroid is basically dead and when they gave the max dose I lost 45 lbs in 8 months with absolutely no changes to my diet or daily routine but then gained it back a year later..

I just literally can't take anymore of this crummy life and to the point of thinking death is a lot better than this and it is better to be dead than keep failing or being knocked down every time I try to do something with my life. 

I also suffer from CPTSD = Complex post traumatic Stress Disorder. I didn't serve just from things I been through in my life and childhood. I also suffer from Severe chronic depression, Severe social anxiety, severe abandonment issues, paranoia and learning issues. I have been diagnosed with them all. 

I have looked up issues with autism and self diagnosing that I may be borderline autistic as I have some of the same issues in that spectrum. I am just so tired of fighting and so tired of going through life like this barely being able to breath and barely being able to survive and have absolutely nothing to show for

35(F) suffer from clinical depression. I feel trapped in my 9 year relationship.,"Hi, I wasn't sure where to post this since it relates to a relationship. I've dealt with depression since my early teen's. It continued to be a major problem in my life until about my mid 20s when I met my current partner. Because of how emotionally mature, supportive and trusting he was, I felt my espisodes we not as frequent or as severe. However as I began to hit my 30s, I started to notice the larger issues that I overlooked when I was younger as not important, like his finanical health (how he views money/saving). He holds a job with little responsibility and low-stress but pays as such (i.e. near minimum wage). He did work overtime for a time to afford a house, which he has but needs me to pay half the mortgage in order to afford it. He says I'm the love of his life but he's not interested in getting married. He's also almost nearly a decade older than me.

I feel trapped because as much as I love him, I want to leave. The major reasons I want to leave are different views towards finances, marriage and moving (he doesn't want to move away from where his parents live). I've been wanting to leave for a very long time but I'm also scared. This decision has caused my anxiety then depression to spring up full force, comptemplating suicide because I'd rather die than live on my own. I haven't lived on my own since my early 20s and every time I lived alone it would result in me being suicidal nearly every day. I struggled, graduated late in college and managed a business degree that did nothing, but earn me an unstable job history and act as a cover to people that I'm doing okay. I just realize how emotionally dependent I am on him and that scares me too. I have no family or friends to talk to about this or for any emotional support. I also hate the state I live in as there are many bad memories here of past abuse. My parents also live here and our relationship remains strained.

What I want is to move out of this city and start over but I don't know if that's my depression talking or what. I don't trust my own decisions or judgements. I have low esteem for myself and my choices. Back to the reasons for leaving my partner though---I feel like who am I to say what I want in a relationship since for instance, I can't even hold a steady job so again, makes it hard to leave him. I'm also currently in school again to once more try a job more suitable to my personality--massage. Until then, I'm stuck living with him for another 6 months.

How do you find the courage to live on your own? Past that, how do you find the will or care to live? I don't have anyone. I mean, I won't have anyone if I leave him and that scares me into staying with him too. Or should I just stay with him and work things out? I'm not sure. I just know I can't sleep well, don't eat much and been crying every other day. Sometimes I just would rather die than have to make a life decision...

I’m losing myself.,"I can’t keep going.

I try and try to be a good person and every time I turn around the world takes something from me. I can’t afford to live anymore. The state of the world makes me sick. My family is so splintered. I lost my dad and my mother is so beyond done dealing with my messed up self it makes my chest hurt.

I never wanted to be this. I wanted to make my family’s life better but here I am a failed 38 year old man who can’t even support himself let alone help those I love.

I don’t know where to turn. Doctors push so many drugs on me and I feel like I can not even think because of it therapy just wants me to blame my father and I do t want to do that, I loved him and he loved me. 

I hate myself and who I have become. I want a normal life. I want to support myself and help my loved ones. I was the rock and now I’m just a pile of shit.

I can’t do this. I hate it, I hate me. I do not remember a time when my chest did not hurt from this. I’m so tired. I want to love someone, I want to be better. I’m going to die like this and I can’t stand the thought.

How can I legally die? I just want to stop being the burden. People will forget me quickly, I provide nothing to this world. 

I’ve never kissed a woman. I’m a damn loser.

I can’t even imagine having a child because I would never want this to pass down to them. The thought of that makes me sick. I just want love, of any type. I just want to hold someone.

Letting go the only thing that make me happy,"I’m 30yr male, living alone, unemployed, broke, alone, and the only thing that get me going is my dream to become a filmmaker, but that dream now starting to fall apart.

Filmmaking has been literally the thing that shape who i am today. I’ve been doing videography and editing stuff for almost 10 years, beside doing my passion project, i also earn a living by edit and produce video for small businesses. Overtime I learned alot about the entertainment industry, but i never part of them. Instead i just do my freelance work, but i do have a dream, to make a feature film. Knowing my own lacking, i study and research as much as i could about independent film and unfortunately in my country, indie scene is basically non existent. I decided to fund my own film, because nobody wants to finance a stranger like me. 

Earlier this year, I thought this year will be the year I finally made it. I sold my car and use my saving to fund a film project which i hope can be the one that gets people attention. As i slowly developing the project, i met several industry folks, with the intention of gaining knowledge and get some support, but instead all i got is them dismissed and laughed at my project because I’m a fool to even dream about making a film with my budget, and more importantly, I’m nobody. I was treated nonchalantly. Hate to say this, but i do agree on some of the points they gave.

Now I’m aware, even if i did make the film, the chances for it to actually help me further my career is slim. I love doing this, and i would love to make a living with this, but moneys are tight, the thought of giving up the only thing i passionate the most in my life, kills me.

Today, I’m just laying hopelessly typing this crap on my phone. I lost all the passion, and motivation to keep going. I’m tired of seeing people, i spent my days at home alone. I’m embarrassed with my friends and family, especially my mom, who has been nothing but supportive.

I’m contemplating if i should let go of this dream and looking for a new job at 30yr.",ministerofterrible,0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/fe5kou/letting_go_the_only_thing_that_make_me_happy/,30yr male living alone unemployed broke alone thing get going dream become filmmaker dream starting fall apart filmmaking ha literally thing shape today videography editing stuff almost 10 year beside passion project also earn living edit produce video small business overtime learned alot entertainment industry never part instead freelance work dream make feature film knowing lacking study research much could independent film unfortunately country indie scene basically non existent decided fund film nobody want finance stranger like earlier year thought year year finally made sold car use saving fund film project hope one get people attention slowly developing project met several industry folk intention gaining knowledge get support instead got dismissed laughed project fool even dream making film budget importantly nobody wa treated nonchalantly hate say agree point gave aware even make film chance actually help career slim love would love make living money tight thought giving thing passionate life kill today laying hopelessly typing crap phone lost passion motivation keep going tired seeing people spent day home alone embarrassed friend family especially mom ha nothing supportive contemplating let go dream looking new job 30yr,letting go thing make happy,minister terrible,2041,44,minister terrible 30yr male living alone unemployed broke alone thing get going dream become filmmaker dream starting fall apart filmmaking ha literally thing shape today videography editing stuff almost 10 year beside passion project also earn living edit produce video small business overtime learned alot entertainment industry never part instead freelance work dream make feature film knowing lacking study research much could independent film unfortunately country indie scene basically non existent decided fund film nobody want finance stranger like earlier year thought year year finally made sold car use saving fund film project hope one get people attention slowly developing project met several industry folk intention gaining knowledge get support instead got dismissed laughed project fool even dream making film budget importantly nobody wa treated nonchalantly hate say agree point gave aware even make film chance actually help career slim love would love make living money tight thought giving thing passionate life kill today laying hopelessly typing crap phone lost passion motivation keep going tired seeing people spent day home alone embarrassed friend family especially mom ha nothing supportive contemplating let go dream looking new job 30yr letting go thing make happy

Two Different People,"It would be nice to hear from other people what you’re experiences have been like.

When I’m on my own or with people I’m comfortable around, I’m “normal.” My version of happy and normal anyway, whatever that looks like with depression wrapped in. 

Then, when I go out in social situations, I’m someone else. I’m frantic, I try too hard to be funny, etc. I’m socially anxious, I guess that’s the point.

But I find these opposites in writing too. When I’m writing I’m intelligent, I have a lot to say and offer people. But when I speak directly to people I clam up. I have a tiny vocabulary. I swear a lot. I saw the same words/phrases over and over. None of these things is particularly bad on their own but together it translates into me being a fucking mess.

My heart hurts,"My heart feels heavy and empty...

 I don't feel like I am loved and cared for. I don't want to be with someone that has lost their job twice due to drinking on the job. During that time I was talking to someone and my partner was stressed out about and he started to drink more and he lost his job twice because of this and it feels like its my fault that I can't do anything that makes me happy. I don't want to care for someone that doesn't care about my needs, emotional and physically.  If I am sick or doesn't feel well, I have to do it myself without someone taking care of me. One time I had a fever and I had to go to work this partner that I am wish was out and never came home, He didn't check up on me and I haven't heard from him.

Friends are finally leaving me. My brain is fucking with me.,"This is a long text about what I'm dealing with.. just giving you a heads up.I hate embarrassing myself and I act in a way I dont like. I maybe acting in a way which balances all the embarrassments I deal with. 

I keep thinking about past moments where it's fucking embarrassing and then I hate to fight to being the person to desire to be. By embarrassing it means either people telling me on my face which hurts me and they know it but still choose to say it because they know Im boring now and I don't have the confidence they saw in me they used to. I'm on their side on this cuz I they are true. And I don't know how to help myself out of this. 

 To be honest I'm lonely like literally lonely only because of me. I'm not open about my feelings and try to just move the conversation about general things. I only love people but not give back anything or show it. Theres not a single person who I have a nice relationship with right now. I mean to say I don't have but they do. Few of my friends care about me and don't want me to get hurt but that's all. I don't like my family because I'm thinking like this just because of their conditioning . I hate my insecure mom who is highly egoistic of herself and can't handle rejection or appreciation she gets defensive for very small things and also expects me to show love to her and give the attention she needs all the time and if I don't do it she gets hurt again and gets defensive. I hate that she's like that and that's in me . That is my biggest problem because I have conversations in my head to fix her cuz I don't want her to be that way and I do this therapeutic talk all the time with her and me. Im starting to get sick of it and handle this. I know all the ways she can't get offended and it's not hard and it's my problem to deal with convincing her. I can't fucking do it I wanna leave her but I can't live with guilt she has given me till now that I can't live by knowing she's gonna get mental if I leave her. She has friends but they're cringe as fuck saying I love you or I hate you. All they talk about is that. She wants everything without deserving it. 

When I say all this about her I know that I act like her and when I say I hate her I hate the part of me that's her. That part of me is not leaving me. I try to give people guilt trips unconsciously or give them situations where I get rejected and I won't take it properly. This feeling of being alone after someone shows that they don't like me is what I want to feel but I want to say to mind that noone likes me and I'm alone. 

Today I truly feel like I don't have a friend to share any of my feelings to because it is truly cringe worthy and embarrassment because I feel like this. I have a lot of potential in me . I have great looks. Im smart. I'm talenting in coding. I'm very funny sometimes. But my ego which judges me and judges others gets all its data and fucks me over and convincing me to feel shitty and unmotivated all the time. 

I can't say these things to anyone I know and I'm always confused with the way I think I don't know what's a good thought or a bad thought because they have their own points which are opposite. Im conditioning and people are trying. To get rid of me because they don't like me anymore. I'm boring and I don't want to settle to this but I'm setting. I hate that this happening but not enough.

This is very general when I say people or feelings but this insecurity in a college environment. Everyone is different here and there only a few cool people. Every friend i know is a confident secure person and deals with Thier problems with friends together. I can't have that.

My personality is dead because of the shit thats in my head. The therapeutic talk. The polar opposite debates about feelings. Numbness. And living with the shitty version of myself. I know this is mood. In other times when I feel genuinely happy I have an answer that says just keep going through whatever it is and it's easy. It's not really easy at other times. And we don't know how long should I wait for the next mood switch to happen.",clientmein,1,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/fduleb/friends_are_finally_leaving_me_my_brain_is/,long text dealing giving head hate embarrassing act way dont like maybe acting way balance embarrassment deal keep thinking past moment fucking embarrassing hate fight person desire embarrassing mean either people telling face hurt know still choose say know im boring confidence saw used side cuz true know help honest lonely like literally lonely open feeling try move conversation general thing love people give back anything show single person nice relationship right mean say friend care want get hurt like family thinking like conditioning hate insecure mom highly egoistic handle rejection appreciation get defensive small thing also expects show love give attention need time get hurt get defensive hate like biggest problem conversation head fix cuz want way therapeutic talk time im starting get sick handle know way get offended hard problem deal convincing fucking wanna leave live guilt ha given till live knowing gonna get mental leave ha friend cringe fuck saying love hate talk want everything without deserving say know act like say hate hate part part leaving try give people guilt trip unconsciously give situation get rejected take properly feeling alone someone show like want feel want say mind noone like alone today truly feel like friend share feeling truly cringe worthy embarrassment feel like lot potential great look im smart talenting coding funny sometimes ego judge judge others get data fuck convincing feel shitty unmotivated time say thing anyone know always confused way think know good thought bad thought point opposite im conditioning people trying get rid like anymore boring want settle setting hate happening enough general say people feeling insecurity college environment everyone different cool people every friend know confident secure person deal thier problem friend together personality dead shit thats head therapeutic talk polar opposite debate feeling numbness living shitty version know mood time feel genuinely happy answer say keep going whatever easy really easy time know long wait next mood switch happen,friend finally leaving brain fucking,client mein,4092,60,client mein long text dealing giving head hate embarrassing act way dont like maybe acting way balance embarrassment deal keep thinking past moment fucking embarrassing hate fight person desire embarrassing mean either people telling face hurt know still choose say know im boring confidence saw used side cuz true know help honest lonely like literally lonely open feeling try move conversation general thing love people give back anything show single person nice relationship right mean say friend care want get hurt like family thinking like conditioning hate insecure mom highly egoistic handle rejection appreciation get defensive small thing also expects show love give attention need time get hurt get defensive hate like biggest problem conversation head fix cuz want way therapeutic talk time im starting get sick handle know way get offended hard problem deal convincing fucking wanna leave live guilt ha given till live knowing gonna get mental leave ha friend cringe fuck saying love hate talk want everything without deserving say know act like say hate hate part part leaving try give people guilt trip unconsciously give situation get rejected take properly feeling alone someone show like want feel want say mind noone like alone today truly feel like friend share feeling truly cringe worthy embarrassment feel like lot potential great look im smart talenting coding funny sometimes ego judge judge others get data fuck convincing feel shitty unmotivated time say thing anyone know always confused way think know good thought bad thought point opposite im conditioning people trying get rid like anymore boring want settle setting hate happening enough general say people feeling insecurity college environment everyone different cool people every friend know confident secure person deal thier problem friend together personality dead shit thats head therapeutic talk polar opposite debate feeling numbness living shitty version know mood time feel genuinely happy answer say keep going whatever easy really easy time know long wait next mood switch happen friend finally leaving brain fucking
Asshole dad doesn't support my dreams. Long rant.,"I'm 24 years old and have recently graduated from college with a BA in art. Art has been my passion since I was a little kid and I hope I can one day have an exhibition showcasing my art. 

So back in 2019 just a few months after graduating college I applied for this artists residence program. I knew that I probably wouldn't get accepted as these  residences are usually very popular and I was still buliding up my
career in art. But I still wanted to try and get more experienced in writing applications and though I'd give it a go and you never know I might just be lucky enough to be accepted. 
This particular application had to be sent in by post. So I asked my mum for a stamp. Later that day my dad sees the stamp booklet and asks what it was doing there. So my mum told him. He just conpleatly lost his shit and started yelling at my mum. He was arngry that my mum hadn't told him about my plans to apply for this residence. I could hear the yelling from my bedroom and came down to see what it was about. 

I can't remember everything that happened and what was said. But basically my dad felt that this was a terrible idea. That the residence wouldn't be good for me and that I shouldn't be moving out. 
I kept trying to explain how there were many benefits of doing this residence. And how I wouldn't be moving away forever. Besides I was 23 at the time. A lot of people my age had lived away from their parents. He, however, couldn't get his head around it. He thought the residence program wasn't legitimate. Despite the fact that I  found out about it through my college lectures and how they literally give us seminars on how to apply to these residences. 

He keep yelling and screaming causing my mum to cry and sleep in my sister's room that night. 

I didn't let the events of that night keep me from pursuing my dream. Fast forward to a few days ago and I'm working on another application for a artist residence. This one also has to be sent in by post. So this time I tell my dad what I'm doing just before he went to bed. He rolled his eyes but didn't say much. 
The next day I'm printing off my application and I can hear my dad speaking negativity about this residences to my mum.

My mum is so kind and loving and supportive of me and my dreams. I really couldn't ask more of her. 
Anyway. I come into the room and tell my dad that I can hear him talking about me. 
He says similar stuff to what he said back in 2019. How he's thinks its a bad idea. How he thinks I shouldn't be moving out. He is of the belief that I'm looking at this with rose tinted glasses. I try to explain how I'm not some stupid little kid just following some whimsical dream. This is my passion. Its the thing I have a degree in and very much plan on pursuing. 
 For some reason he cannot understand what a 
residence involves. I thought the team residence made it fairly obvious. However I try to explain how its a place you live and work in. So you can produce artwork in a proper studio. He's still just shaking his head saying its a bad idea. I ask him why he thinks its a bad idea but he just cuts me off and tells me to tell him why its a good idea.
Once again I try to explain the benefits. Because I'm just making small bits of Watercolour paintings in my bedroom and having a studio would be so much more ideal.
He stars asking questions about how they chose people. I explain about how you send in a cover letter, an artist cv, and images of your work.

For some reason he keeps referring to the residence as a course. My mum and I tell his how its not a course its a place to live and work. He doesn't seem to understand. 
He says how the only people who will benefit from this course are the people running in. 

He seems to believe that because I wouldn't be paid to attend this residence that its a waste of time. 
I'm not even asking my parents for money to fund this residence. I planned to pay the rent myself. 
The he says how I should be looking for work. He's a bit of a booomer. He seems to think that there's loads of jobs going round and I just couldn't be bothered to get one. Not true. 

I had a job not too long ago but it was temporary contract work which ended a few weeks ago. 

He has the nerve to say that when he, himself has been unemployed since the early 2000s and my mum is the main breadwinner.
 He just happens to be related to wealthy parents whom he inherited loads of money from when they died. He doesn't know the struggle of looking for work or having a strict budget. 
I asked if he'd prefer if i were in some dead end job that made me miserable. No he says. He'd like to see me in a job that makes me happy. And he sort of suggests to continue with art on the side but apparently working and doing an art residence is just too much. 

Anyway, getting back on track. He mentioned how he thinks I'm too vulnerable and not ready to move out. I don't know how he's going to react when I have enough money saved up to move out. But he can't stop me from moving out and living my own life. I haven't even been accepted by the residence program and he's acting as if I'm leaving to live on the other side of the world.
Everything up to this point has been very upsetting and stressful and depressing. But than he goes and says that I'm not good enough or talented enough. Thst these no future in this residences. No future in art. 

That fucking hurt but I highly suspected this. I told him that I already knew that. This man hasn't even seen half of my art. Hasn't see what I'm capable of doing. And doesn't understand how the art world works. If I were bad I wouldn't have gotten my BA. It's still so hard to not let his words get to me. I'm still planning on applying for open calls to residences and exhibitions. I know i have talent and I work hard. Even if I'm not currently good enough that doesn't mean I should stop. The only thing that will stop me from having a future in art is if I give up. So I won't give up until I have made it.",jenniferyoung03,0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/fe5ixt/asshole_dad_doesnt_support_my_dreams_long_rant/,24 year old recently graduated college

I’ve reached my breaking point-,"Okay so I have absolutely no one to talk to, so forgive me for ranting here and making little to no sense. I just really need to get things off my chest. 

I really want to die. I’ve reached the point where I would be fine with a car crashing into mine and killing me, or being shot, or getting a terminal illness; I’m not picky over how I die, I just want to vanish from Earth. And I’m too much of a coward to do it myself, though I think about it all the time. My family has grown attached to me, despite the fact that they used to hate my guts during my teenage years. I fixed my relationship with them, and I know dying would hurt them but I’m a selfish idiot. 

I recently started college and it’s awful. I used to be a great student in high school, the type of student teachers praise by saying they have a great future ahead of them. But along the way I fucked up. I feel dumber and dumber each day, I see my classmates learning quick while I struggle to understand a simple class. I can barely finish assignments on time and each day I find less reasons to finish them. I fear failing my classes, I’ve never failed one before but at the rate this is going I probably will. My family has put so many high expectations on me, and I’ve always known I would never meet them. 
I’m not even studying what I wanted because my mother disapproved of my original career choice. I wanted to study physics, but she made me study electronic engineering. 
The firsts exams were awful, I know I still have time to recover from my pitifully mediocre scores but I seriously doubt I will. 

I have no friends, my personality is awful and I never learned how to talk to people, I’m too awkward. I’m also incredibly hideous and fat, there’s nothing I like about myself. I absolutely loathe everything about myself. There’s no redeeming quality about me. I used to think I was smart but it’s clear I’m a dumb idiot that never should had been born. I wish my mother aborted me when she had the chance. I’m just a fucking waste of space. 

I can’t even cry anymore. Hell, I don’t even feel anything most of the time. I’m just numb, but sometimes I feel dread settle over me and not leave for days. I’m an useless, worthless piece of shit. I know that. I just want to disappear. I hope to fall asleep and never wake up. 
My birthday is in two days but I don’t think I can handle turning eighteen years old, I know not much will change but I can’t just keep living. Each day feels like torture, getting out of my bed takes too much of me and falling asleep is too difficult. I’m just really fucking tired all the time, no matter how much I sleep.

Today has been tough.,"Today has been harder than most. 

Bit backstory: my girlfriend and I recently broke up. It was something out of our control and I don’t blame her or hate her for it, but it meant upending my life and moving 300 miles away and back in with my parents after 7 years of being in my relationship and being independent. I left my life and my cats behind, they were basically holding me together at the time. I lost my job in September and have had a really hard time finding work. So as you can imagine I’m feeling pretty low right now. 

The main issue: my mother and I have never really gotten along. She’s unpleasant to be around for long periods of time. Fine in small doses though. She basically shits on everything I do or try to do. There’s always something negative that she brings to the equation that takes the wind out of my sails. 

I went for a job interview last week, it went okay. Wasn’t great, wasn’t terrible. I was confident that I was on the border of getting it. I got the rejection email this afternoon. It felt like I got kicked in the stomach by a shire horse. It was an awful feeling being knocked back. I applied for 43 jobs and that was my only interview and I didn’t get it. I was feeling pretty bad, then my mum came in to the room. She decided now was a good time to ask “what would you do if you didn’t have me and your dad to feed you and keep you?” A pleasant topic of conversation. I said, “well, I’d be homeless and sleeping rough I’d imagine mum.” She didn’t seem satisfied by this response and decided to go on a tirade about how I should seek unemployment benefits and such. Which I would, but my last ounce of pride won’t let me. I should also mention that I haven’t asked for a penny of charity from her since I got back. Anything she and my dad have paid for is listed on my phone and I fully intend on paying her back when I’m working or have some money coming in. I haven’t loaned money from my mum since I was at uni. Not because I didn’t need the help, I just couldn’t handle the arguing anymore. My sister however, currently owes my mum and dad thousands and they don’t chase her for it. Whenever she needs help they drop what they are doing to help her. I don’t know if I’m just bitter about that because my mum makes the statement “we treat you both the same” all the time, but I know they don’t. 

She continued to twist the knife until I couldn’t take it anymore and just walked out of the room. 

I should say, that she doesn’t seem to mind having me around when a delivery is coming and she wants to go and see a friend, or when I make lunch and dinner, or when I do housework. I feel like a should help out around the house where I can. Most of the time it’s not good enough for her, but at least I tried.

No motivation to do anything.,"Very painfully (for me) over the past few months I've lost my best friend. Despite my trying to make things better I couldn't salvage things. We've gone from a really good friendship to barely talking at the end of the day, mostly because of routine. I still care about this person greatly, but its pretty clear thats not the case for this person

Over that time period, my mental state has just gone down the drain. This person was really my only reason to get out of bed in the morning, and be the best version of me that I can be.

I've gone from an A student, to a B student, to a C student, and now im having trouble bringing myself to do any schoolwork at all. I just want to lay down and sleep, even though im getting less than 5 hours a night.

I've been having suicidal thoughts for the past month and I honestly dont know how much longer I can hold out, with the lonliness and the stress given for being an academic student (Canadian system)

I've always been more of a lonely kid, but over this friendship I was shown how much greener the grass is when you have someone to talk to, someone that (seems) to enjoy your company, and can make you smile.",CanadianLanBoy,1,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/fe20bu/no_motivation_to_do_anything/,painfully past month lost best friend despite trying make thing better salvage thing gone really good friendship barely talking end day mostly routine still care person greatly pretty clear thats case person time period mental state ha gone drain person wa really reason get bed morning best version gone student b student c student im trouble bringing schoolwork want lay sleep even though im getting le 5 hour night suicidal thought past month honestly dont know much longer hold lonliness stress given academic student canadian system always lonely kid friendship wa shown much greener grass someone talk someone seems enjoy company make smile,motivation anything,canadian lan boy,1160,29,canadian lan boy painfully past month lost best friend despite trying make thing better salvage thing gone really good friendship barely talking end day mostly routine still care person greatly pretty clear thats case person time period mental state ha gone drain person wa really reason get bed morning best version gone student b student c student im trouble bringing schoolwork want lay sleep even though im getting le 5 hour night suicidal thought past month honestly dont know much longer hold lonliness stress given academic student canadian system always lonely kid friendship wa shown much greener grass someone talk someone seems enjoy company make smile motivation anything
My local hospital doesn’t take my depression and PTSD seriously.,"A bit of background:
I’m 25, F and live in eastern Canada. I live in a small town where more people here fake being ill to get out of work or have other habits.

I’ve been suffering from depression for as long as I can remember being alive. I was first fully aware that I wanted to die since I was 6, I’ve begged for it every day of my life since then and every birthday, that’s what I wished for; even til this very day. 



I’ve been going to a doctor in my town to continue working on my depression, she prescribed me medication which started to make my state worse by an increased amount of suicidal thoughts, more flashbacks, and now irritation as well as mood swings. I’ve been diagnosed with PTSD, Dysthymia and Anxiety. I’m constantly trying to make it a point to address to every doctor I’ve been to in the past 8 years that I literally hate being alive and I’ve even been honest as to how many times in a span of a year Ive tried to commit suicide, even up to date. I’ve tried signing myself into our local hospital to try to be admitted to get real help and they’ve only ever kept me for a night each time. Ive begged to stay and I’m still sent home since I seem calm. 

I have always acted like I was fine in front of people since I was raised that it was not okay to be depressed or show negative emotions as I had an abusive mother. Because of that, I can’t express sadness normally, instead I just seem calm and most thing I’m being sarcastic or trying to be funny. I don’t openly cry in front of others since I honestly hate people seeing me cry when I’m a support figure for a lot of people I know. 


I’ve tried making appointments with psychiatrists (we don’t have psychologists at our hospital, they’re hours away and I can’t drive), but they often push Ativan which doesn’t react well with me. I’ve spoken to therapists and they have said I’m getting help in that way but I also need to be medicated if therapy isn’t doing much for me. 

Does anyone know what I should do?
I can’t keep fighting this anymore. I’ve been doing all that I can and I feel like it’ll never get better when all I do is hide in a bathroom and cry each night, wish that I was dead if there’s no fix for what’s going on or just isolate myself from others so I won’t be a burden anymore.",LadyDeathXIII,4,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/fe57lt/my_local_hospital_doesnt_take_my_depression_and/,bit background 25 f live eastern canada live small town people fake ill get work habit suffering depression long remember alive wa first fully aware wanted die since wa 6 begged every day life since every birthday wished even til day going doctor town continue working depression prescribed medication started make state worse increased amount suicidal thought flashback irritation well mood swing diagnosed ptsd dysthymia anxiety constantly trying make point address every doctor past 8 year literally hate alive even honest many time span year ive tried commit suicide even date tried signing local hospital try admitted get real help ever kept night time ive begged stay still sent home since seem calm always acted like wa fine front people since wa raised wa okay depressed show negative emotion abusive mother express sadness normally instead seem calm thing sarcastic trying funny openly cry front others since honestly hate people seeing cry support figure lot people know tried making appointment psychiatrist psychologist hospital hour away drive often push ativan react well spoken therapist said getting help way also need medicated therapy much doe anyone know keep fighting anymore feel like never get better hide bathroom cry night wish wa dead fix going isolate others burden anymore,local hospital take depression ptsd seriously,lady death xiii,2281,64,lady death xiii bit background 25 f live eastern canada live small town people fake ill get work habit suffering depression long remember alive wa first fully aware wanted die since wa 6 begged every day life since every birthday wished even til day going doctor town continue working depression prescribed medication started make state worse increased amount suicidal thought flashback irritation well mood swing diagnosed ptsd dysthymia anxiety constantly trying make point address every doctor past 8 year literally hate alive even honest many time span year ive tried commit suicide even date tried signing local hospital try admitted get real help ever kept night time ive begged stay still sent home since seem calm always acted like wa fine front people since wa raised wa okay depressed show negative emotion abusive mother express sadness normally instead seem calm thing sarcastic trying funny openly cry front others since honestly hate people seeing cry support figure lot people know tried making appointment psychiatrist psychologist hospital hour away drive often push ativan react well spoken therapist said getting help way also need medicated therapy much doe anyone know keep fighting anymore feel like never get better hide bathroom cry night wish wa dead fix going isolate others burden anymore local hospital take depression ptsd seriously
Worth?,"I hate always being reminded our lives are going to school, getting an education, hopefully get a good paying job and pay taxes. I know there are other stuff, Marriage or whatever. But as another year passes, I feel the years flying. I remember being in elementary telling my self in recess, “wow, I’m never getting to high school.” Here I am, I was a positive child and adults had hope for me. It’s sad to see depression hold me down. If I need to be happy I need to change something. I hate taking meds and being on a schedule. People are gonna treat me different if they find out. My dumb arrogant self also lashed out at my girl best friend. I think she hates me. I said sorry like a million times, I wrote paragraphs to get her to forgive me. She recently came up front and told me she was feeling suicidal recently, and me getting mad at her just made it worst. I’m trying to fix it as best as I can. She said if she can get a hug but she still won’t talk to me in class, hallways, or over text. Her reason is she doesn’t like getting personal. And she’s told me in the past she’s had family problems, so I know she’s stressed. I don’t know if I’m annoying her but I’m keeping positive vibes. Just today one of my “friends” with ADHD said his friend was gonna give him a gun and shoot two teachers. I trust one of my gym teachers the most in the school, more than my family. I mean the guys gone through it. I had him for class a year ago, and in that same year he was divorced. He knows depression and stress. Anyways I told him and he thanked me a bunch. I think he’s speculated I have depression, he’s a health teacher and I always talk to him so I know he knows somethings off. He sent me to the VP and told him the story. They both basically hailed me for keeping the school safe. And I’m grateful. I like being reminded people care for me, I just don’t see it. And neither do you probably. Think of an old teacher or friend you always talked too, I’m betting they’re missing you right now. 


Alright I know I wrote a lot but it just kind of blurted out, I knew I had some stuff going on, but now I’ve wrote it out I see the bigger picture of my self. I’m sorry if I’m not making sense, it doesn’t to me either.

Someone loves you, I swear about that. Don’t take your life, don’t take another’s, maintain those you love, because they love you back.

What do you do when no one can help?,"I went to a school counselor to talk about some recent &gt;!sexual!&lt; trauma and general ill feelings and I left there feeling worse about myself.

I haven’t been to therapy since 2014, and it was mostly for dealing with depression symptoms.  Therapy helped me tremendously, and I felt better talking  with complete transparency about my baggage with someone equipped to handle it. I went back recently and the interaction boiled down to them telling me 1) I was medicated at too young of an age (started SSRIs very young) and therefore my parents raised me incorrectly, and 2) Skepticism that the therapy ever helped me. He literally asked me, “did that even help if you stopped going?”

He told me his background was in social service, and he recorded the session for the school’s records. He also told me that after this preliminary session he would refer me to a person with the proper  training, but after our session ultimately decided he would take me on for appointments “I don’t normally do this, but scheduling is too hard right now”

I'm moving to a new city soon, so I really feel scared about how I'm going to support myself. As someone who's generally self-sufficient this was sort of a heavy blow, since I really need someone to talk to.",dottielane,0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/fdzscs/what_do_you_do_when_no_one_can_help/,went school counselor talk recent gt sexual lt trauma general ill feeling left feeling worse therapy since 2014 wa mostly dealing depression symptom therapy helped tremendously felt better talking complete transparency baggage someone equipped handle went back recently interaction boiled telling 1 wa medicated young age started ssri young therefore parent raised incorrectly 2 skepticism therapy ever helped literally asked even help stopped going told background wa social service recorded session school record also told preliminary session would refer person proper training session ultimately decided would take appointment normally scheduling hard right moving new city soon really feel scared going support someone generally self sufficient wa sort heavy blow since really need someone talk,one help,dot tie lane,1254,36,dot tie lane went school counselor talk recent gt sexual lt trauma general ill feeling left feeling worse therapy since 2014 wa mostly dealing depression symptom therapy helped tremendously felt better talking complete transparency baggage someone equipped handle went back recently interaction boiled telling 1 wa medicated young age started ssri young therefore parent raised incorrectly 2 skepticism therapy ever helped literally asked even help stopped going told background wa social service recorded session school record also told preliminary session would refer person proper training session ultimately decided would take appointment normally scheduling hard right moving new city soon really feel scared going support someone generally self sufficient wa sort heavy blow since really need someone talk one help

Realizing My Friends Might Not Really Care For Me The Way I Thought They Did,"   Well, I’ve been thinking about posting on here and you know what? Today I’m just going to do it. I’ve been feeling abnormally sad for almost five years now. I’ve never gone to get clinically diagnosed with depression so I won’t say I have it-but after having some dark thoughts these past three years...I won’t deny it if that ends up being the case.
   I have always had a small group of friends, and that circle is down to three. Out of those three friends, I have had one since 1st grade. After a mess up on my part (that happened almost three years ago), we haven’t been as close as we once were. We don’t share emotional things anymore. But we do laugh and joke a lot. That’s mainly what our friendship is now. We only talk when we see one another, and if we contact each other over text-she usually finds a way to cut the conversation short. I know I’m loosing her. It hurts but I know she will find someone better than me to be by her side....
   I have a second friend, she’s been my friend since 6th grade. I don’t feel like I’m loosing her as much as the others-but life issues are getting in the way of me seeing her so we haven’t been able to talk much-if at all...
  And my last-perhaps my closest friend now, just admitted today that he doesn’t believe in the whole ‘friendship’ ordeal. He said that he believes none of his friends actually like him-and he said that right to my face today. He’s detached from people, and when he thinks people don’t care about him...he doesn’t care about them. On top of that he’s been really distant lately, and we don’t have the deep conversations like we did in the past. When we talk it’s about nothing in particular and it hurts the most seeing him go because he’s always been there for me during my super low times. In response to what he said, I promised him that I would never stop trying to show him that I cared for him, but he brushed me off and said have fun trying.
   I feel like I’m loosing my friends slowly. I don’t talk to anyone anymore. I feel alone. I hate going out into public because that reminds me of how people have friends...when mine are slowly fading. I don’t know what to do anymore. They are the reason I’ve been pushing through-and the reason I have pushed through in these past five years. I don’t know what to do.
   I can’t talk to them because they aren’t very emotional, and the one that is (the one that I haven’t been able to see due to life issues) doesn’t deserve this type of weight on her shoulders. I guess this is just more of a vent to get this off my shoulders. I could go on and on about so many different things but...this is the one that has been killing me as of lately.

I'm tired of being alive,"I haven't been sleeping much lately, I wake up with heavy drowsiness, despite not being able to fall asleep. I don't want to continue like this, I don't want to live if this is what life is.

My daily thoughts are riddled with shame, regret, disappointment, anger, and worry. There is so much I wish I had done differently, or not at all. I don't talk to anyone about it because no one would quite understand. It is much easier said than done to not compare oneself to others, forgive, or move on from the past. I haven't lived a day of my life at the age of 25 because of my circumstances and poor decision making.

I feel helpless and powerless. The world is hostile, overly competitive, and parasitic. The deluded turn to their illusions of grandeur via religion, but no loving god would allow this atrocity of a world. I don't feel I have a place that I belong

I wish I had made friends sooner, I don't have anyone now and I feel that I am just a burden. I wish I had gotten a job instead of letting myself be pressured into post secondary education, I have no money or direction now and I feel that I am a failure. I wish I had stood up for myself in bad relationships, I don't have any self respect now and I feel that I am a weak loser. I wish I had matured sooner, I am very far behind in life and I feel that I cannot catch up. I wish I had any confidence in myself, I am convinced that it is too late to make anything worthwhile because the foundations of my life are rotten and building on rotten foundation is recipe for disaster.

I wish I had a better family, a better community, a better world to live in, and I wish I was a better person. No matter what anyone says, I don't believe much can change.

I'm not like others, I wish I was. I can't use social media at all because it floors me to see others doing things I wanted to do, and seeing the results of the better choices they made.

I wish life were easier, people were kinder, mistakes could be undone, and I wish I didn't feel so down all the time.

I belt myself to stop thinking about women and it's breaking me,"I was bullied for most of my school life. It started to get better at around 11th grade. Before that I have never really experianced girls that were nice to me. But for as long as I can think I have been dreaming about the soft touch of a woman. Not sexually but just being hugged. Or snuggling. Now at the end of 10th grade I started self-improving like theres no tomorrow. And it went uphill for me real quick. I started to work out daily, started fighting sports, joined the volunteer firefighters, volunteer wildlandfirefighters and recently sent out my application for the german red cross. It all went well exept one thing. I still wanted a girl to like me. Now more than ever before after I finished firefighting training and had my first ""psychologically demanding"" firecalls. Sometimes I just come home and wish that a girl would just come out of nowhere and hug me. I am still a kissless virgin even though from the outside I may even be desireable. At least thats what some people tell me. But because most of my life there weren't really any girls that were nice to me, I interpret every single nice thing from a girl as some kind of flirt. Then I get feelings for almost every single girl there was. They could be as bitchy as anything but as long as they're a woman, I would develop feelings for her and make advances. Openly flirting with almost every girl I knew. I was sort of known as the needy guy. Some people told me and I slowly realised that I had no chance with girls if I act like this. Then one of my ""favorite crushes"" (there are a lot of them) had a long talk to me. I told her how I felt about my needyness and my past. She told me I dont have any chance with her (she told me before) but that if I stopped thinking about girls all the time then maybe someone would actually turn up. That was the first time I really talked to someone about my problem and it was devastating. I couldn't stop thinking about women. For years when I'm home alone I'd pretend that there was a girl in my bed. Asking how ""her"" day was, making out with the pillow and everything. Sometimes at dinner I would put two plates on the table and just talk with ""her"" about ""her"" day. I didn't know how to help myself and because of all my volunteering work and sports I don't have time for a therapist. So then I had the idea of punishing myself if I'd think about women. And with no other ideas I started doing that. Every day I'd take my leather belt, take off my top and start belting away at my back. I'd take my phone and turn on porn and start belting myself so I would stop getting an erection when something sexual happens. At school and volunteering work I'd pinch my trizeps real hard whenever I'd think about women or would look at a girls butt or breasts. Now everytime I see a girl I'd just catch a glimpse of her and quickly look away. In the beginning it helped. I stopped thinking about girls. But after some time I was on edge all the time. Hurting myself at the slightest thought of someone. I'd look at women at firecalls or when I otherwise needed to. But otherwise I'd look away. And now it just hurts. My confidence has plumeted. I'm looking at the ground the whole time. I have spots on my back and arms. I am feeling like shit all day. Tired and with no motivation for anything anymore.

First post here many years of depression,"Hi, depression is something I’ve been dealing with off and on for at least 15 years. I’m 33 married with two young kids, I come from a family with parents who want to be supportive but do not really understand depression and mental health problems. It’s made worse by the fact my two younger siblings are already more accomplished than I am. Anyways I’ve been in therapy 3 times over the last 15 years and quite honestly it’s been a disaster each time, I’m to the point where I no longer believe in psychotherapy as a legitimate means to help myself.

This recent bout has started late October and has been moving into the severe, life affecting depression the last two months. It’s made much worse by having to look my wife and precious children in the eyes everyday knowing I’m failing them. My wonderful children 2.5 and 1 year old bring me so much joy but then so much anxiety that I am failing them, wasting my life in a malaise with no real impending problems. 

Probably the worst part is people who know me but don’t live with me would never know this, even when depressed I can fake it in social situations and I would say people think I’m funny, personable and when I’m not depressed I have a keen mind and have had some mild success in business or other endeavors. So people would be shocked to read or hear how tortured I feel mentally. 

Like an idiot I fell into old traps, trying to just “take the edge off” with a couple drinks in the morning just to get through the tough times, Which the veteran depressed reading this will be shaking their heads knowing how much worse that makes it. Luckily I recognized it early enough and cut it out cold turkey and haven’t had a sip in 10 days or so. Right now I just need some inertia to get out the door, run my small business and provide for them. Today is the worst I’ve felt in years, paralyzed by my demons, it’s absolute agony. 

Becoming a father has been the best thing that’s ever happened to me, but if I fail my children and wife I’ll never ever forgive myself. I need to face things head on but it’s that fear of what damage I’ve done the last few months being negligent and having to once again dig myself out of this hole. You see I know more major bouts of depression are in my future but I worry how many more recoveries I have in me, I make life so hard on myself with the inconsistencies, it’s such torture. 

Thanks for giving me a forum to say this.",Lionsjunkie,9,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/fduput/first_post_here_many_years_of_depression/,hi depression something dealing least 15 year 33 married two young kid come family parent want supportive really understand depression mental health problem made worse fact two younger sibling already accomplished anyways therapy 3 time last 15 year quite honestly disaster time point longer believe psychotherapy legitimate mean help recent bout ha started late october ha moving severe life affecting depression last two month made much worse look wife precious child eye everyday knowing failing wonderful child 2 5 1 year old bring much joy much anxiety failing wasting life malaise real impending problem probably worst part people know live would never know even depressed fake social situation would say people think funny personable depressed keen mind mild success business endeavor people would shocked read hear tortured feel mentally like idiot fell old trap trying take edge couple drink morning get tough time veteran depressed reading shaking head knowing much worse make luckily recognized early enough cut cold turkey sip 10 day right need inertia get door run small business provide today worst felt year paralyzed demon absolute agony becoming father ha best thing ever happened fail child wife never ever forgive need face thing head fear damage done last month negligent dig hole see know major bout depression future worry many recovery make life hard inconsistency torture thanks giving forum say,first post many year depression,lion junkie,2426,40,lion junkie hi depression something dealing least 15 year 33 married two young kid come family parent want supportive really understand depression mental health problem made worse fact two younger sibling already accomplished anyways therapy 3 time last 15 year quite honestly disaster time point longer believe psychotherapy legitimate mean help recent bout ha started late october ha moving severe life affecting depression last two month made much worse look wife precious child eye everyday knowing failing wonderful child 2 5 1 year old bring much joy much anxiety failing wasting life malaise real impending problem probably worst part people know live would never know even depressed fake social situation would say people think funny personable depressed keen mind mild success business endeavor people would shocked read hear tortured feel mentally like idiot fell old trap trying take edge couple drink morning get tough time veteran depressed reading shaking head knowing much worse make luckily recognized early enough cut cold turkey sip 10 day right need inertia get door run small business provide today worst felt year paralyzed demon absolute agony becoming father ha best thing ever happened fail child wife never ever forgive need face thing head fear damage done last month negligent dig hole see know major bout depression future worry many recovery make life hard inconsistency torture thanks giving forum say first post many year depression

"Nothing matters anymore, getting worse"," Hi..I don't know where else to go. I am devastated right now, feeling like I'm spiraling out of control, I feel so fucking numb from crying my lungs out. Even my best friend is no longer supportive, my family, parents at home are shit. I have no real friends who care, and I can't be bothered to do anything right now, I just want to sleep without waking up to see another morning. I feel so fucking pathetic and shit, I cut myself regularly now and I'm having so much fucking self pity, I'm pretending to be normal because I don't want to lose my best friend, the only person who has helped me come this far from previous suicidal attempts. But suppressing it makes it so much fucking worse I feel like nobody fucking cares, no matter how many times I shout for help. No one close to me cares. I don't know what to do. I'm leaning towards paracetamol poisoning all over again, if I die I die, If I don't I try a different method. I just feel like absolute shit, jobless. I regret everything in my life, every fucking thing, I don't know who to trust anymore, I don't even have a fucking shoulder to lean on while crying my lungs out. Im in a LDR, from past 6 months, (not prior to that) as she's studying overseas, I can't even fucking have her hold me in her arms when I'm feeling like shit. She is the best and supportive, and my best friend but I can't hurt her by harming myself so It's a fucking struggle. I just feel so enraged and angry at everything..I can't fucking find a job due to covid-19. Sometimes it feels like If I had some money to get myself kicked off I can go near her and find a job and at least stay sane. But right now it all seems so fucking impossible I feel like I'm such a fucking mess and I just wish to fucking die right now, I feel so much burden when I inhale, I just want to die.

I need help I am sad,"Hi so I would like to know what's your opinion on this.

So there was an activity at my college, in which students from different schools were coming the univ to see it and explore it. When they came, the college gave them a ticket to get a free meal. We, students of the college itself, are really unhappy with the university because they always have money for anything but the university itself, charging us a lot of money for things that are not there. So we, unleashed, decided to take back what's ours. One guy printed out a lot (maybe like 15-20) tickets of the food and we went there to get the food by ourselves. So at the end of the day, the food was done earlier than usual. We did it only for 2 days out of the 3 days the whole college stuff was happening.

Getting work done when Depression is telling you that you can’t do anything and you’re worth nothing kills me. (Unfortunately not literally),"Hey. 16M here. I’m just a wee little high schooler but I feel like I’ve been through a whole ass war with my own fucking brain. For context, my depression got intense at around 7th-9th grade. Finally it’s started to slow down and I don’t want to kill myself as much as I did in middle school. But not everything’s is so hunky dory. I don’t know if I’m alone on this and I doubt I am, but it’s so hard to get motivated to do anything but play video games and smoke weed. Now I know I’ll probably be told that the weed isn’t helping with my motivation, which it isn’t, but that isn’t the issue. My issue is that I don’t have any drive to want to better myself or to do anything other than what is fun to me. Am I alone here? Is this because of something other than my depression? 

I never do homework, I never study, and these days it’s actually affecting all of my grades and that kills me because I could get away with doing *some* of my homework and get amazing grades on tests and 9 times out of 10 I’d pass with a C or above. But now I’m getting Fs in my classes and I just want to quit. I can’t find a reason to continue being in this useless place we call school for my “education”.

"Looked In the mirror, and fuck man.","

I have run into 2 major problems in my life atm, it has been eating away at me for the better part of a month. I’ll give you some backstory:

I have people pleaser all my life. I feel like I have always gone with the flow, with people’s expectations of me rather than have my own. I have done that since I was a kid and I’m now turning 20 this year, And with that being said the first problem I have run into is, I don’t know what I want and like partly due to the depression. But mostly due to the fact that I’ve never really done or said what I wanted to to outside forces shutting me down at every turn (school, parents etc.). Idk and it’s driving me up a wall.


2: I thought hard about the people pleaser trait in my being a lot and I have come to this conclusion, I hate who I am. I believe that I am selfish and feel because I haven’t done what I have wanted in my life I am inauthentic. So I go and look for outside validation and love because I feel like I am incapable of it. But when I receive it, and it doesn’t hit the way I wanted it to or things are too fast or far. Like a addict I dump them and look for a new person to give me that feeling I long for. It’s fucked up, because the other people care about me and I do to to an extent, but I prioritize my own feelings and shit first. And that realization fucked me up so bad. Real bad.

I have nowhere and no one else to say this,"This is going to be a long post because i have a lot to say, sorry in advance.

 I dont see any way my life can get on track, I'm 23 years old, i have achieved nothing noteworthy in life and i've generally lived a life of isolation, this stems all the way back from secondary school where i was relentlessly bullied for being black and overweight, i was only 11 years old when i first got diagnosed with depression because of the sheltered life i had lived before then meant i had no idea what people would be like once i got to high school, no one told me that being black was something that people may not like, no one told me that being overweight would be something kids would make fun of, but it happened, for 4 years straight, throughout high school i ran into various obstacles i'd never want a kid to go through, almost weekly fights, bad report cards and parents evenings lead to detentions and 3 day exclusions which lead to me starting to simply skip school and not go, i tried so hard to get myself kicked out of that school because my mother would not take me out of the school, i didnt understand why then and i still dont understand now and i think part of me resents her for that to this day, i truly believe my life could have been so different if i didnt get forced to stay at the school that almost killed me multiple times. 

The bullying definitely subsided a touch in the last year, with kids wanting to get into good 6th forms they started looking to just finishing their exams i guess? But the damage was already done, i started school a pretty normal happy kid with a fair few friends who didnt think about much besides what pokemon i needed to catch to fill my national dex or if i the cartoon i wanted to watch was recorded but by my last year i was could barely be bothered to do anything, i didnt talk to anyone i simply went to school and got the bus home and avoided people at all costs, i had skipped way too much school to get good grades and i could motivate myself to want to study, i was getting the bare minimum to get into 6th form and hopefully that was enough to scrape by. But as if things wern't bad enough i went on a residential school trip with one of my classes that was cut short because I ended up having a severe athsma attack when we got the the accommodation camp, this was my first time having an athsma attack and my first time i'd have ever been to hospital and i was only 15 so my first feelings were obviously of extreme panic, a small part of me i'd say was honestly relieved, maybe this was the end and i wouldnt have to go on, the ambulance got there and i must have asked the responded a hundred times if i was going to die, obviously she cant tell a child 'probably' so she said no and was comforting me, the ride to the hospital felt like an eternity. To wrap this part up obviously i didnt die but i had woken up a week later in the icu surrounded by my family, it was weird seeing my dad and mum together as well as their partners because they had been split up for a long time but i was just happy i woke up i guess. I had to stay in hospital for a few days more after i woke up for tests and rehab, getting used to walking again after being in bed for a week was interesting and a lot harder than i ever thought it would be, i was told that people who suffer acute asthma attacks generally have a low survival rate, i cant remember the exact number but it was low enough to cause a reaction from everyone. We left the hospital and i was told i wouldnt be able to go back to school for at least a month, obviously any kid would be thrilled to hear that but i was super happy because it meant time away from hell on earth. 

However the recovery process during that month kind of set the precedent for a hole i got trapped in and am still trapped in, doing nothing for a month meant i got into some pretty lazy habits but also i got used to being on my own world just playing xbox and watching tv during the day. Transitioning back into school life was harder than anticipated because it was half days to start off with and that was for about 2 weeks. Fast forward a bit and the bullying starts again because fuck it why not bully the kid fresh out of hospital right? it gets to exam period and i have full on sacked off school, i skip most days and get put into the assisted education program where you take exams in a different room and have a personal TA and some counselling sessions, of course none of this really helped me because i just didnt have any care for my education i just wanted away from school asap. I by some miracle without studying at all managed to scrape by with enough GCSE qualifications to go to 6th form on the condition that i would have to take english and maths alongside a foundation year. This leads onto my next problem:

For more reasons unknown to me which i can only chalk up to she cant be bothered, my mum decided for me that i wasnt going to go to a college in my hometown, i would have to instead go to live with my dad and do my 3 years of college there. Now i should probably explain why this is a problem, my dad and I dont get on well, we havent for as long as i stopped being a child and we still have barely any real relationship, i just talk to him like once a month to talk to my little brother and sister who obviously i have no reason to not have a relationship with. I wont go into as much detail here because this post is already feeling too long but theres so much more to get through. Long story short my dad was extremely emotionally abusive, anything that he didnt like would be met with screaming banging on things and threats of physical violence, this would be for anything from not doing the dishes to not studying earlier than what was on my plan. This again warped my view of education because i wasnt really doing courses i enjoyed but rather what was available to me and i didnt feel inspired to commit to it by studying, most of my study time was just sneaking my phone on silent. This went on for 3 years straight, i was isolated, the only person i really interacted with was my abusive dad and my teachers and classmates when i had to. When i tried to confide in my mother she simply told me other people including herself had it worse and hes just strict and does it because he cares about me and wants whats best. So i gave up on that as well. Throughout my life one of the few things i really enjoyed was playing video games and I used it as an escape to just ignore my real life situation and responsibilities, how healthy that is is up for debate but if i didnt have that escape who knows if i'd even be typing this here now. He didn't like that i played video games because he said that it was pointless and took away time i could be studying or looking for work, so he took it away and never let me have it back on any occasion after half of the first year. 

Thats when things got really bad for me, without something to pass the time and take my mind off of things my depression and suicidal tendencies came flooding back, i started self harming and i still look at the scars along my arms sometimes and get reminded of how bad things were back then, i never thought that they would still be there 6 years later, i wish i had thought about that. Somehow 3 years later again without really putting in any effort i managed to complete my A levels and get enough points to get into University. on a foundation entry degree, I guess this was when i was happiest because i was finally free from my parents and maybe i could be someone new and different, I never would have imagined myself where I am now 4 years ago.

Uni life started off fine, i was still avoiding people and keeping to myself but a couple of people on my course would always sit next to me and try to talk to me, I guess because seeing someone sitting on their own in their first year of Uni made them want to include me so i even managed to have friends, the first year had some hardships because i was never taught how to budget or be independent so of course money got tight towards the end but aside from that i don't think my first year had any issues, i passed without any issues and found myself advancing to the first year of the actual degree. I wont go into detail for every year but i'll just say that apart from the odd times we'd go out together I still mostly stayed in my flat playing games or watching stuff online, I didnt party and I didnt study, I just kind of drifted, then for whatever reason i cannot remember i got into an argument with my mum, i cant remember what about but she sent me a message saying that she was done with me and i didnt really know what to feel, I just kind of stopped, I stopped going to uni, i stopped going out i stopped everything, i just started spending every day waking up, playing games and eating junk food, sleep, repeat. As you can imagine having a lifestyle like this really did a number on my mental and physical health. I would go an entire week without showering sometimes more, my only human contact was taking my food from downstairs, this was my lowest point. 

Obviously i failed the year because i didnt attend or do all the work. The next year i was allowed to stay at the Uni and take up a different course, thinking that i could just power through it, but apparently during all of this student finance (the company that pays your tuition fees) turned around and said they wouldn't fund this year of learning for me, which obviously kind of fucked me over completely. Because they told me I wouldn't be funded i decided that there was no point in going, because i certainly don't have 9k just laying around to pay the fees myself, I didn't attend a single lecture all year and lived the same unhealthy life i had lived towards the end of the previous year for the entire year, it was horrible. The one beacon of hope that i could find was that eventually i had to start benefits as i didnt get money to pay the rent or anything so that covered that, meanwhile there was a local game store that ran a tournament for the game a play and i really enjoyed going to that once a week and made friends with the team i was assigned to, my life finally felt like it had some form of normality, i had a decent friend group, i was finally going out and i had something to look forward to whilst i tried to find proper work to fill my time and move into my own place, but unfortunately i couldnt find work and it came time to decide what i was going to do next in the summer, at this time i had another argument with my mum because she began to catch on that clearly something was wrong and i didnt want to go to university and do a degree i had no interest in.

We hadn't spoken in almost a month and i was sure we had cut ties but then she messaged me pleading me to come to an open day for a course that did in all honestly sound extremely appealing to me so i went and the place seemed nice and this where I am now, i got onto the course and i'm currently here now in the same situation but worse that i was in for the 3rd year at the previous uni, i havent attended almost any of the classes i'm almost certainly going to be kicked out or have to retake the year, but thats not even the worst part, the worst part is that i'm still being asked to pay for other years that i was told would be funded including this year, meaning i'm in an insane amount of debt with no way to pay it off, this year also isn't being funded despite being told it would be and i'm currently in negative balance in my bank account with the next payment of my underfunded maintenance loan coming in on the 20th of next month, i havent eaten in 3 days already and i dont feel all that good, my parents aren't an option and i have tried to ask for help in the loans/assistance reddits but i got marked as a scammer because i wasn't getting any replies but kept trying, I don't know what to do, I think I am well and truly ready for the end, I don't see how I can recover from this hole i put myself into, I'm 23 years old, with no degree, debt, no work experience meaning i cant get any jobs despite the 100's of applications i've probably sent off by now, i've never had a romantic partner, hell i've never even had a real best friend, i'm completely alone and I don't think anyone will miss me when i'm gone.

I'm sorry this was such a long read, but I don't have anyone else to talk to and really explain things to, so this is my last resort, I dont think i want to die, but i really don't see how I can live

I hate my best friend,"let me start off by saying that I hate my best friend sometimes not all the time. The basic reason is because she's so perfect and I feel like such a waste and piece of shit when I see her. I'm 16 and a sophomore in high school. We met last year as freshmen and I had never had any friends before so I immediately just accepted her. She was 13 when we met so she started kindergarten early and skipped a grade. then there's me who's two years older but nothing compared to her. She gets straight A's, takes all AP and honors classes, made VARSITY softball as a freshman (age of a 7th grader), got the lead roles in all the theatre shows, and just has a perfect life. 

Then there's me who doesn't have the best home life. I've tried telling her I can't sleep over because I need my meds and for other reasons. But then she just tells me ""oh everyone feels sad sometimes. You don't need those stupid pills."" Or if I tell her that it's my anxiety and ADHD pills she is like ""everyone has some form of ADHD. Have you seen everyone who can't pay attention? Those pills don't do anything""

I'm very reluctant to end our friendship because I don't have any other friends. Also my Mom has gotten really close with their family and I can't end the friendship beacuse that would be awkward. I feel like this is toxic though. Idk maybe it's just cause I'm not good enough I feel like shit.",joho3883,1,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/fdu7fp/i_hate_my_best_friend/,let start saying hate best friend sometimes time basic reason perfect feel like waste piece shit see 16 sophomore high school met last year freshman never friend immediately accepted wa 13 met started kindergarten early skipped grade two year older nothing compared get straight take ap honor class made varsity softball freshman age 7th grader got lead role theatre show ha perfect life best home life tried telling sleep need med reason tell oh everyone feel sad sometimes need stupid pill tell anxiety adhd pill like everyone ha form adhd seen everyone pay attention pill anything reluctant end friendship friend also mom ha gotten really close family end friendship beacuse would awkward feel like toxic though idk maybe cause good enough feel like shit,hate best friend,j oho 3883,1379,21,j oho 3883 let start saying hate best friend sometimes time basic reason perfect feel like waste piece shit see 16 sophomore high school met last year freshman never friend immediately accepted wa 13 met started kindergarten early skipped grade two year older nothing compared get straight take ap honor class made varsity softball freshman age 7th grader got lead role theatre show ha perfect life best home life tried telling sleep need med reason tell oh everyone feel sad sometimes need stupid pill tell anxiety adhd pill like everyone ha form adhd seen everyone pay attention pill anything reluctant end friendship friend also mom ha gotten really close family end friendship beacuse would awkward feel like toxic though idk maybe cause good enough feel like shit hate best friend

I'm having a hard time.,"What do u do when you're in a dark place?
I'm married, I have one kid, dog, cat, house to clean.
I'm sick rn (just cold, but I have UC, so it's worse for us). Last yeah I was in hospital 5 times. This year one. All. Because of stupid UC. I hate myself, I hate how I look. I don't feel any support or love from anyone in my life except my little daughter. She's the only reason I don't commit suicide. I don't have strength anymore. There are plans to have 3 surgeries in near future. One of them is gastric sleeve - because I can't get rid of the weight because if the medicine I use, I feel ugly and fat. I miss the lovely feeling u get from first kisses, from love, excitement, happiness. It's just... My life is dark rn. I think about suicide alot, I've told my husband, mom (who doesn't belive clinical depression is a real thing), my therapist (who has a hard time with me, because I'm a stubborn little Satan). I don't know what to do... I know where I can get sleeping pills, so I'm just afraid my daughter will loose her mother soon.
And I'm in Norway, I'm afraid of telling doctors about my suicide thoughts because here they are really happy to take away child from your family for every little shit. I don't know what to do. I'm done with this whole life and shit. I have pain in my whole body and I don't have any pain relief meds (because Norway only gives you paracetamol fuckery).",DepressedPandaLola,0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/fdw7fv/im_having_a_hard_time/,u dark place married one kid dog cat house clean sick rn cold uc worse u last yeah wa hospital 5 time year one stupid uc hate hate look feel support love anyone life except little daughter reason commit suicide strength anymore plan 3 surgery near future one gastric sleeve get rid weight medicine use feel ugly fat miss lovely feeling u get first kiss love excitement happiness life dark rn think suicide alot told husband mom belive clinical depression real thing therapist ha hard time stubborn little satan know know get sleeping pill afraid daughter loose mother soon norway afraid telling doctor suicide thought really happy take away child family every little shit know done whole life shit pain whole body pain relief med norway give paracetamol fuckery,hard time,depressed panda lola,1395,23,depressed panda lola u dark place married one kid dog cat house clean sick rn cold uc worse u last yeah wa hospital 5 time year one stupid uc hate hate look feel support love anyone life except little daughter reason commit suicide strength anymore plan 3 surgery near future one gastric sleeve get rid weight medicine use feel ugly fat miss lovely feeling u get first kiss love excitement happiness life dark rn think suicide alot told husband mom belive clinical depression real thing therapist ha hard time stubborn little satan know know get sleeping pill afraid daughter loose mother soon norway afraid telling doctor suicide thought really happy take away child family every little shit know done whole life shit pain whole body pain relief med norway give paracetamol fuckery hard time

Suicide Attempt?,"A couple weeks ago, I overdosed on some Xanax I had lying around and chased it down with some vodka. It put me into a deep sleep and that took me around 36 hours to completely recover from. A friend found me at some point during this since I wasn't returning any of their calls and they know what I struggle with. Anyway, for some reason, I haven't really thought about what happened at all since then and I guess I kind of just shook it off (or tried to). But now that I'm thinking about it, I'm questioning what my intent was behind doing what I did. I didn't ""plan"" to kill myself but I remember thinking to myself ""if this kills me, that's okay."" Should I consider this a suicide attempt or just an odd lapse of judgement? I should mention that I have attempted suicide before and the thought process was much different than what happened this time which is part of the reason I'm so confused.",mthammer1,3,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/fdsdvo/suicide_attempt/,couple week ago overdosed xanax lying around chased vodka put deep sleep took around 36 hour completely recover friend found point since returning call know struggle anyway reason really thought happened since guess kind shook tried thinking questioning intent wa behind plan kill remember thinking kill okay consider suicide attempt odd lapse judgement mention attempted suicide thought process wa much different happened time part reason confused,suicide attempt,mt hammer 1,897,16,mt hammer 1 couple week ago overdosed xanax lying around chased vodka put deep sleep took around 36 hour completely recover friend found point since returning call know struggle anyway reason really thought happened since guess kind shook tried thinking questioning intent wa behind plan kill remember thinking kill okay consider suicide attempt odd lapse judgement mention attempted suicide thought process wa much different happened time part reason confused suicide attempt
Advice on getting out of the mentality of not wanting to live.,"I know it’s better to see an expert rather than stranger on the internet but I’ve been to 2 therapist and they haven’t helped. 
I’m 23, male, fit and healthy, come from a good upper middle class family who support me well and I really have no hard struggles to deal with. Despite all this since about the age of 10 I’ve wished I was never born and would rather be dead. Really the only thing keeping me from suicide is that I don’t want to put my family/ loved ones through that pain. This may be decent enough to keep me alive but still isn’t much of a viewpoint to live from, there are times I resent my family because I have to endure the pain and stress of life just because of them. 

I would just much rather be dead than go through the stress of living and working for the rest of my life, call it depression or laziness or whatever but it’s just my viewpoint in life and I can’t shake it. 
Does anyone out there have a similar mentality and have ever thought or been told anything to truly shift them out of that mindset? Therapy has never done anything to help me shift out of this and I almost feel like it’s too much of a therapist to be able to do so.",Imagine17,4,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/fdw24a/advice_on_getting_out_of_the_mentality_of_not/,know better see expert rather stranger internet 2 therapist helped 23 male fit healthy come good upper middle class family support well really hard struggle deal despite since age 10 wished wa never born would rather dead really thing keeping suicide want put family loved one pain may decent enough keep alive still much viewpoint live time resent family endure pain stress life would much rather dead go stress living working rest life call depression laziness whatever viewpoint life shake doe anyone similar mentality ever thought told anything truly shift mindset therapy ha never done anything help shift almost feel like much therapist able,advice getting mentality wanting live,imagine 17,1163,62,imagine 17 know better see expert rather stranger internet 2 therapist helped 23 male fit healthy come good upper middle class family support well really hard struggle deal despite since age 10 wished wa never born would rather dead really thing keeping suicide want put family loved one pain may decent enough keep alive still much viewpoint live time resent family endure pain stress life would much rather dead go stress living working rest life call depression laziness whatever viewpoint life shake doe anyone similar mentality ever thought told anything truly shift mindset therapy ha never done anything help shift almost feel like much therapist able advice getting mentality wanting live
Hugs,"Sometimes I dream about being hugged by my friends,when I am with them I just keep looking at them hugging other people and thinking ""I want a hug too"" but in the end I just try to forget about it,I don't expect to get a hug,so why should I ask for one?",gafsr,2,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/fduuvo/hugs/,sometimes dream hugged friend keep looking hugging people thinking want hug end try forget expect get hug ask one,hug,ga f sr,253,4,ga f sr sometimes dream hugged friend keep looking hugging people thinking want hug end try forget expect get hug ask one hug
I'm tired,"How do I say that I want to lay in bed all day and do nothing? How could I convey to my parents that not wanting to exist is one of few thoughts that I have? I don't want to work, but still my parents force me to, I know this might sound as if I'm lazy. And I am, no doubt in that. 

Tbh I didn't ask to be born, let alone grow up to do stuff that I'm not interested in. If I were to have my dream job, I'd work on it in my pace, but obviously that isn't how it works.

I always come to work, most of the time I'm late, 10-20 mins but I still arrive and work. 

Now I want to run away, cuz I'm tired of them complaining about how I always sleep or that I'm lazy and do nothing all day, that I'm always in my room and not check in on them. That I can't smoke weed to cope with my thoughts.

We only get one life. One. I don't want to spend that time thinking about suicide, and then complain in my head about the options and how painful or too fast it's going to be. 

I don't want to run away, but most of our time we've been together all I hear is an in depth negative comment of how my life is, and contrast to a simple ""I love you."" I do get ""how are you feeling today?"" Or ""what are you up to today?"" But I can't say anything with honesty cuz then they'll start to ask questions that I can't answer without breaking down and shit. 

I almost don't care about family and friends. But I think one fateful day, I'll make that irrational decision and run away. I really am tired of listening to the implications of how bad my life is, and I don't want to hear it anymore. I just need a little push that goes a little too far, then I'll probs snap and head the fuck out. Who knows.

I'm angry at myself and them, and honestly I want to hit stuff and scream at the top of my lungs. But I gotta keep it together, right?

Took a creative writing class because it's the only thing I'm good at. Now I feel like sh*t.,"Writing is basically my only talent. It's the one thing I can do with consistency. I'm not athletic. My art is passable but nowhere near good. I can't do stuff with computers. I can't make music. Don't do anything with friends because I don't really have any. So I write. 

Didn't mesh with one of my classes for this semester. Subbed it with a CW class because why not? We had to do a setting/dialogue assignment a while ago and just got them back. 

In short, I did sh*t, apparently. 

Basically, it wasn't really what we were supposed to do for the assignment. That's fine; I misunderstood the instructions and will do better next time. The problem is, he didn't say he liked anything I did. I did a little piece based on a project I've been kicking around that I really liked. I thought it was good. I wanted it to be good. I wanted someone who does this stuff professionally for a living to think it was good. But the note he left read to me like he didn't really care about it or didn't like it. 

And that hurts. Really really hurts. Writing is basically my only talent. I want to publish something someday. I want to be able to hold a book I wrote in my hands and feel like all those sh*tty experiences I had in high school and so far in college could be balanced out by something good I did under my own power without anyone else. Something that could only be chalked up to me. Something that could get me some modicum of respect. Something that could prove I'm not just some boring person with nothing interesting about them who's completely, utterly average.

Hey.,"I'm posting here for the first time on my main reddit account. People I know will probably see this, they'll probably laugh, but I don't care anymore. I need to vent my feelings someplace. I'm a male, so the general stigma around depression for men is to just 'suck it up' like we don't have emotions. Things haven't been going well for me for a long time, and i'm constantly miserable. I feel as if nobody cares about me, and that life will never get better at all. I've never had anybody i'd consider a true friend really my entire life and now i'm 20, it's starting to really hurt. My social circle consists of two people, to which i'm sure they can't stand me. They're always making stupid jokes and putting me down, but - shit, they're the closest people I have to real friends, and the only people I talk to on a daily basis. I'm at rock bottom right now. Every single friendship I've ever tried to make has just turned people away from me, like i'm some monster. I don't even feel human anymore. I don't feel like I fit in anywhere. I need help. I need to fix myself, i'm a broken person. I don't even know what to do with myself anymore, honestly.

Red Dead Redemption 2 helps a lot.,"I've been getting progressively worse throughout this year, and I found myself having the exact same days over and over again. My social life is pretty much nonexistent at this point, and I've found myself struggling to hold onto friends that are drifting away from me.

Then I started playing this game, and I'm actually excited to get back to my apartment and spend time in this world. It feels so rewarding even just to spend the whole day hunting or working on a level 10 beard. It gives me a sense of purpose I haven't really been feeling lately. I'm probably going to spend about a month in each chapter of the game because I want to prolong my time playing.

"How I feel at the moment. If anyone needs any motivation to seek help, this is it. Years of avoiding signals to get help can lead to a breaking point if the person isn't strong mentally, like me.","The last couple of months    ,             I've been tired . 

 I wanna die. Really badly. I don't wan't to cause the people that somehow still love me this pain, they need me here. But I am just so tired, so fucking tired.  I'm tired of this sad, mean, world. I feel like I can succeed, but I don't see the point if I still will not be happy. On the other hand I get the point, try to make family happy, and spend the little time we have with the ones we love. Someone of you may say, ""at least you are lucky you have people that love you this much"", and that is true. If it wasn't for them, I would not be here a long time ago. However, perhaps the feeling that brings within me the most pain and sorrow is: what if that love is not reciprocated? Don't get me wrong, I love these people. But I don't love spending time with anyone. I don't even love spending time by myself. I don't know what I want or what will make my day better. The thought of going through the same cycles of just trying to find some little piece of happy in the day for me and my loved ones for the rest of my life makes me not want to live through it. I find the bad in every activity, see the negative flaw of every person, while at the same time try to keep 'face' as much as possible. I think I can summarize this feeling into: I feel guilty for the pain that I cause my loved ones, but at the same time I am so fucking selfish. I just can't take it anymore. I feel like I am loosing my shit, I don't even know if I am depressed, crazy, bipolar, i don;t know. It just hurts. I want it to stop. \*I wanted better for myself

&amp;#x200B;

Overall, I don't know why I am writing this. 

I don't even want any help or input{

I just want this sadness to go way, I can't go around another day with my head down and my eyes filled with tears. I just feel like I wasn't born to act like this, I wanted to be strong physically and mentally in order to provide for my loved ones, not tear them down with my negativity. 

everyone problem is bigger than mine. I am just a selfish bitch who is too much of a pussy to deal with his own fucking emotions. There are people in this world who have gotten a much shittier hand. yet here i am fucking wanting to die. how does this make any sense?

It's also really hard to hide being so fucking sad; I am 6'6, live with my loving girlfriend, and trying to be social in years when I still had hope means there are still people who think I want friends in my life that try to reach out once in a while. Only to receive an excuse/ insult/ rambling when I try to avoid them. 

&amp;#x200B;

No matter how much effort I put into happiness, I can't seem to get close without cheating. Sure, some things make me happy, but as soon as they do, my mind almost tries to find the negative in the situation. 

&amp;#x200B;

To end this shit, I wanna make a wish.   
I wish for the kids who have to be strong, to have bull sized balls, and help every person in need. 

Because the false sense of protection is the last thing that they need. 

If you can't do it, don't say you can. Because when you don't, or aren't here, they will stay behind wondering why you every left. 

&amp;#x200B;

Stay strong everyone,

Now I feel unsatisfied. It was the last thing I still enjoyed. I can’t read, I can’t write, my musical instruments (cello, piano, guitar) are literally gathering dust. I stopped playing video games that require thought, I haven’t sung in half a year. I hav n’t drawn since before Christmas.

I have anorexia and my mom took some pics of us all hanging out.

Rediscovering Meaning in the midth of it,"To everyone out there, the people who have suffered from depression, perhaps for many years. This is my first post, I am, like so many of you lying in bed, have been for many months, known this state for decades.

You are not alone. And whoever you believe yourself to be right now that is not true. remember the person you were when you were fine, happy, in a better place. Feel it, embody that. I know that I am holding on to it. And if life has been mostly dark it helps to believe that experiences of happiness and joy exist somewhere outside of this state...just like Martin Luther king believed in his dreams even at that particular time it seemed impossible.

I do not know what caused you to land hard in this state, for me it was relationship loss, failure, deep loneliness and isolation-I have no family and lost my relationship/friendships to depression- people left-, though life circumstances (financial issues/living environment and of course the abusive childhood) AND my reactions to them e.g. blaming myself, self-sabotage, feeling futile, discouraged, bad habits, unhelpful implicit relational and emotional patterns that keep repeating. Whatever it is that led into this black hole. I guess the situation gets more frustrating with every attempt to heal that did not work. I tried many medications (almost all of them), several psychiatric stays, several years of therapy (CBT, depth psychology), the Hoffmann process, all kinds of meditations, body work, “giving up and surrender”, Eckhart tolle etc you name it.. they all helped a little but nothing really worked in the long term.

And it sucks that nothing seem to work permanently. 

However, I deeply believe that there is meaning imprinted in everyone’s heart. What is your life worth living? What would you like to experience?  If you we’re dying what really matters to you?Lying in bed, can you imagine and feel experiencing it? The happiness, the joy, whatever it is you wish for? In every ayahuasca experience and every other methods that helped me temporary what really helped was seeing clearly this pattern of depression replaying (the thoughts, the emotional pain, the energetic pattern) and then break free of it for a while until familiar patterns re-emerge. It is like getting on a diet and putting on weight again... rebuilding relationships is a huge part of my recovery. So I guess I wanted to reach out to you and ask the question what dreams do you have today? How can you believe in them in your head first and in your body? Often the despair is exactly next to this dream. But keep building that belief. You are not alone, please do not give up.

The Beast is pulled from the Dead Sea. It’s body is a salted wreck, and 7 heads top 7 ruined spines, and it is classified Gastropoda Megido by the Great Philosophers, and their steel physicians spit lightning down the nerves and its thrashing causes

The twitching in the upper atmosphere of a radio worm that is caught by the numbers stations and woven into the twelfth wavelength and a man in Moscow breaks the limestone shell on the humming copper dials and twists it into the monotone buzz and broadcasts to

The concrete bunker under Bikini Atoll where the pristine carcass of Einstein is still breathing in its galvanised cradle and a host of mathematical spectres are recording the convulsing patterns of his immortal cortex and from it they realise

That there is a Ford T-Model in a dusty cobalt sheen travelling Route 66 surrounded by a corona of cyanide and sulphur and the passengers are twice as worse as the driver and the drivers nails curl around the steering wheel and the colour of his eyes is the same as the arterial shades seen in the severed limbs of the myriad cadavers littering the streets where


A company of knights are solemnly striding through the wreckage and their banner is a dying CRT monitor from which a host of wires vomit forth into the shuddering rubber cancer of the power grid and upon the screen can be seen

A low resolution image, a pixel rupture bloom in which can vaguely be discerned the silhouette of a pallid hairless figure, and it slowly turns towards the camera which whines and coughs molten filament in protest at the eyes of the thing which

Flicker through a chemical veil rising from the blistered bones of the buildings, the weeping solar sore brushing the earth with a curtain of incomprehensible colour before

i think it’s time.,"i’m 17, im a senior in high school. i wake up, i go to school, i come home, i do my homework, i do chores around the house, i take care of the pets, i take care of myself, i eat when i should and i shower and i keep my room clean. i go to the gym and i actively produce art. i listen to music, i play guitar, i spend time with my mom and friends. im not unhappy, my life just feels so dull and gray. i’m not sad or angry, i’m not upset about anything. 

there have been previous years of my life that were overcome by anxiety and major depression and self harm and even a suicide attempt. but then i was sad, i was angry and confused and disgusted. i’ve suffered ptsd since age 12, and that affected me a lot. it still affects me, especially now that i have a form a physical ptsd (that’s how my doctor described it, i don’t know what else to call it) from overdosing 2 years when i tried to kill myself. 

but trauma aside, i don’t feel anything negative. of course i have my bad moods like anyone else, but really i’d say i have more good moods than bad moods. i laugh, i smile, i joke (a lot, i’m the comedian of my circle). 

i tell you all of this because it’s so odd that i live my life on autopilot, doing everything i should and being more positive than i used to be. but almost every hour of my day is filled with thoughts of suicide. i fantasize of slicing my wrists open to watch the blood pool in the tub beneath me. i imagine driving to the old hanging tree on the other side of town in the middle of the night and leaving my body dangling for someone to find in the morning. walking on the sidewalk i laugh to myself as i think about jumping in front of the cars rolling by.

Feel fake,"Every interaction just feels fake. I always want to be the popular guy (charismatic) considering I dont have many friends if any and hide away from people spending at least 15 hours a day in a room watching tv shows I've seen 100s of times.

Theres just a constant your not good enough, people are just being nice and dont really like you, they know your fake and try hard. Im conscious of everything how I walk, talk etc. I cant seem to accept myself, struggle with being authentic and just fill myself with information on the subject. 

I know I have to stop being a bitch and get a grip but it's like an internal battle and its exhausting. It's like I cant just let go for some reason.

i feel so empty at the moment,"i was perfectly fine until about 9pm last night (i randomly started crying out of nowhere as i was watching a perfectly normal youtube video, although i've forgotten what it was about, but it wasn't anything upsetting or triggering).

so i go to sleep at about 10ish and assume that i'll be better when i wake up, but i was wrong. i woke up still depressed and crying again, not wanting to get out of bed or do anything, let alone go to uni and do my work/study. i get up and get ready (although this felt like it took an eternity to do), and go to uni for a while, but i found it really overwhelming. i don't remember what else happened, but i decided to go back home (student flat) and try to take my mind off work even though i can't because the deadlines are coming pretty fast.

to think that i was full of energy and ideas 2 days ago is beyond me since i've barely had the energy to get out of bed this morning. i also don't have the energy to cry anymore, so now i'm just empty and wanting to die. also this post doesn't really make much sense, but i'm super depressed and empty that i feel like i can't function anymore",snoos_operator,1,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/fdvtyl/i_feel_so_empty_at_the_moment/,wa perfectly fine 9pm last night randomly started cry nowhere wa watching perfectly normal youtube video although forgotten wa anything upsetting triggering go sleep 10ish assume better wake wa wrong woke still depressed cry wanting get bed anything let alone go uni work study get get ready although felt like took eternity go uni found really overwhelming remember else happened decided go back home student flat try take mind work even though deadline coming pretty fast think wa full energy idea 2 day ago beyond since barely energy get bed morning also energy cry anymore empty wanting die also post really make much sense super depressed empty feel like function anymore,feel empty moment,operator,1127,29,operator wa perfectly fine 9pm last night randomly started cry nowhere wa watching perfectly normal youtube video although forgotten wa anything upsetting triggering go sleep 10ish assume better wake wa wrong woke still depressed cry wanting get bed anything let alone go uni work study get get ready although felt like took eternity go uni found really overwhelming remember else happened decided go back home student flat try take mind work even though deadline coming pretty fast think wa full energy idea 2 day ago beyond since barely energy get bed morning also energy cry anymore empty wanting die also post really make much sense super depressed empty feel like function anymore feel empty moment

I don’t feel loved by anyone and I don’t think anyone loves me,"Im a freshman in college. I feel terrible writing about all my problems on an online forum, but I’ve gotten to this point in my life where I just feel stuck and I feel like I can’t confide in my friends or family. I feel sad all the time. I don’t like myself and I don’t think I ever will, but what gets me to care about myself the most is when people show they care about me because it reminds me of what makes me happy. 

But lately I just feel like a burden to everyone. I recently told my close (best?) friend at college that I hate myself and that sometimes, even though I would never do anything to myself, I feel like there’s no point in me being here. She told me that she doesn’t want to hear stuff like that and that she’s going to distance herself because that made her worry about me all the time. And I understand and that I should be going to see a counselor but it just hurts. Because yea if my friend told me that I would worry but I also wouldn’t push them away because I would understand that they just need someone. 

It hurts that I put my whole heart into all my relationships and that I would do anything for the people I care about and to lift them up but at this point it feels like they wouldn’t do the same and I just feel alone. I feel like everyone is fed up with me and that I’m just sad and there’s so many things missing from my life and I don’t know what’s wrong with me. I don’t know why I try so hard to be this amazing friend and person to everyone around me and it gets me nowhere.

SSRIs and NDRIs and not killing libido,"I'm a mid-20s woman with rapid-cycling bipolar II but I'm posting here because I'm asking about antidepressants and how to control my depressive episodes.

My moods were under control when I was on lithium and zoloft, but the zoloft (50 mg, so not much) absolutely ZAPPED my sex drive. I would force myself to do it to please my partner (no, he did not coerce me). Aside from that, I felt the best I'd ever felt. No complaints otherwise.

Last June, I went off the zoloft and stuck with the lithium and felt fine, but I felt some depression symptoms coming back after a couple months. My anxiety and reactivity increased, but I was still WAY better off than with no meds whatsoever.

In December, my psychiatrist recommended an NDRI to help prevent a change in libido. I started wellbutrin (100 mg so again, not much) and it was definitely helping, but now I'm feeling some depression symptoms coming back again. I have spent the last week thinking I'm stupid and pathetic and useless for no apparent reason. My psychiatrist thinks I did better on an SSRI, but the lack of libido was awful and not something I ever want to experience again. I know that particular symptom varies from person to person, so I wanted to know about others' experiences with those classes of antidepressants and if symptoms varied from drug to drug, even within the same class.",scorpio_szn,4,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/fdyyl9/ssris_and_ndris_and_not_killing_libido/,mid 20 woman rapid cycling bipolar ii posting asking antidepressant control depressive episode mood control wa lithium zoloft zoloft 50 mg much absolutely zapped sex drive would force please partner coerce aside felt best ever felt complaint otherwise last june went zoloft stuck lithium felt fine felt depression symptom coming back couple month anxiety reactivity increased wa still way better med whatsoever december psychiatrist recommended ndri help prevent change libido started wellbutrin 100 mg much wa definitely helping feeling depression symptom coming back spent last week thinking stupid pathetic useless apparent reason psychiatrist think better ssri lack libido wa awful something ever want experience know particular symptom varies person person wanted know others experience class antidepressant symptom varied drug drug even within class,ssri ndris killing libido,scorpio zn,1355,38,scorpio zn mid 20 woman rapid cycling bipolar ii posting asking antidepressant control depressive episode mood control wa lithium zoloft zoloft 50 mg much absolutely zapped sex drive would force please partner coerce aside felt best ever felt complaint otherwise last june went zoloft stuck lithium felt fine felt depression symptom coming back couple month anxiety reactivity increased wa still way better med whatsoever december psychiatrist recommended ndri help prevent change libido started wellbutrin 100 mg much wa definitely helping feeling depression symptom coming back spent last week thinking stupid pathetic useless apparent reason psychiatrist think better ssri lack libido wa awful something ever want experience know particular symptom varies person person wanted know others experience class antidepressant symptom varied drug drug even within class ssri ndris killing libido

"Been back on medication for depression and anxiety for the past week and I still feel... Like.. Well, you know. Need advice.","Been put back on antidepressants to help me with anxiety and depression. Also, short term benzo. Nothing is going right in life at the moment. And I've taken to hurting myself in anyway as much as possible.

I have no control and alone in this, no one that actually wants to walk with me through this... Which, is the norm.

And, I've done what I always do, which is cut everyone off, delete/deactivate everything, go to work with a mask on every day, crying myself to sleep every single night.

Guess, knowing that I'm actually getting up and going to work is a good thing. As last time I just let everything go. I'm not as deep as I was back then, but I am still sinking right now.

Don’t know how to keep going with the award system broken in my brain,"I see the brick walls where I used to see beauty. Eating no longer feels pleasurable. My hobbies make me agitated. My friends make me anxious.
The only part of my brain that still works is the fear response. 

I’m not sure how much longer I can keep going. I grew up being taught to do the right thing—and I know continuing on is the right thing—but I didn’t realize how much human sanity relied on positive emotions. We are not guided by instinct—we are guided by these emotions. Mine are directing me towards death, and I wonder why, in the most advanced on minds, this pathway exists (suicide is unique to humans even though animals kill themselves).

Advice for a significant other of someone with depression,"I have been dating my bf for about 4 months so the relationship is fairly new.

We have never discussed depression before however my ex also struggled with depression and suicidal thoughts throughout our 3yr relationship. I always did my best to be loving and supportive to my ex but I also felt like I didn’t know the best things to say.

And I'm right back where I started...,"I had been doing so well for months and everything has come back full circle, if not worse. This move was supposed to be great for the both of us. More money and better opportunity for him. Getting away from all the bad stuff in our old town and new opportunities for me. But, everything is not how we would hoped it would be. Money is even tighter than before. I don't know how he's going to make his car payment, or pay for internet, or rent. Even make the trip back to see his parents this weekend. Nothing we do seems to be enough or even matter.

I am beyond stressed. I'm barely sleeping anymore, I just can't shut off my mind. All the thoughts racing back and forth in my mind of the things that I should be doing instead of sleeping. Like cleaning, finding a better job or a second job. I lay awake stressing about how to help more when I feel like everything I do now isn't enough, and I'm just waiting for everything to come crashing down. 

Yet, on the other hand, I am ANGRY. I'm angry that I'm getting no help from him. I do all the household chores amidst his claims every day of ""after work I'll come home and clean"". It's my paycheck and any extra cash I get a hold of that is immediately spent on bills because his check wasn't enough because sales were down the last month, or was spent on game passes and subscriptions for games. I was the one who drove there and back to go do his errands while he was sitting on the beach in Mexico with his friends. 

And I. Feel. Terrible. 

I'm right back to being sucked into this numbness, this darkness. All I want again is to just not wake up in the morning. To have everything just be over. The thoughts of suicide and self harm are back in full force and the only reason I haven't harmed, is because I simply don't have a razor blade in the house...

I don't know what to do,"Hi guys,

it is the first time that I write on this sub and it is also one of my first posts but honestly I feel myself sinking and maybe writing about it will help me. By the way I'm Italian so forgive me in advance for my English.

I'm a 20M and I've been suffering depression for 5 years now, before I thought it was adolescent sadness and I have never given it too much weight. But after two path of psychoanalysis with two different psychotherapists I was diagnosed the ""thing"".

I'm struggling every day with suicidal thoughts and the situation is going worst cause the situation in my home is terrible, I live with my grandma (who also suffers of depression and take Xanax and prozac every day) my mother who is a strong career woman but she uses me as her personal therapist since I remember and my little brother who is my only light in this house. My father works in another city and I don't see him that much. In the last six month my father said to my mother he don't love anymore her and there is another woman. I don't judge him, who am I to do it? But now I've always my mum emotionally destroyed that reach for my help, but I don't know how to help her and more the time goes on more I can't talk with my dad normally.

I tried to escape from this situation in October moving away in another city, I thought I need to live alone and away from that house, but the depression strikes hard on me and I had to return in my original home to afford to return in therapy.

Currently the situation is becoming uncontrollable, even my friends have noticed it, I've always been very good at hiding my problems, and one of the last evenings they have made me a sort of intervention for my drinking problem. I honestly reveal them that I don't have suicidal thoughts only when I drink.

I hate my self so much, I'm known in my city for my drunken adventures and I don't like it but the thought of stop drinking kills me.

Overreacting VS social isolation,"I really do not understand why I am isolated for ""coming across"" a certain way. People will judge you based off your innate defense mechanisms, but then the next day, it's like when I hit reset and try again to get to know someone, I can't. I'm a permanent smear of my mistakes. (I'm human, others aren't I guess?) I guess depression has made me ""unapproachable"". Which I don't grasp, because I am constantly in the presence of people who treat me like dirt (which obviously puts me in the offensive).

A lot of people around me also get defended by their friends when they face trials, I.E. ""they're having a hard time, just try to understand them"".  But I get told to change. As if I don't deal with my own? It makes no sense.

Does anyone else do this? Face isolation because people misunderstand their emotional turmoil? This has caused me great hardship, stress, and mental breakdown. It'd be nice to feel normal.

"If you never had a crush, be grateful","It's the worst catalyst to depression. Period. Remember all your problems? Now they are amplified. They feel worse because you feel like you have an escape in love but you don't and you never will. You start fantasizing over and over about the ""salvation"" of your life, the only source of possible happiness that you can imagine, and the more time passes the worse it gets. It hurts and it ruins your head it's either suicide or find salvation in that person. I've never hurt this much over fucking fiction. This person as I know it is in my head. I am in love with a person I created, I don't even know this person, just her exterior, yet I feel like I'm close to this person and it hurts not imagining a fake relationship. It hurts so fucking bad it feels good to think abandoning this world. No regrets. Why?
I am doing a favor to my crush and myself. Yet it still hurts I can't fall asleep. How does this make any sense? How strong is fictional love? Who is making me feel like this? I want to escape this hell. I already have crippling thoughts about my future and this just keeps coming up to me and it's so bad. So so bad.

Wondering late at night,"It is midnight and I cannot sleep again. I cannot remember the last time I slept through the night. I sleep in tiny spurts throughout the day but can never stay down for long. I often have nightmares even when I do stay sleeping for some time.

The other night, for example, I woke up screaming. I had been dreaming that I was eating a bowl of cereal and looked down and my spoon was covered in spiders. I actually like spiders so I am not sure why it scared me so bad. My husband reached over and held my hand and shushed me until I calmed down. It seems like he is too good to me always. I feel like I don't deserve it.

Tonight I looked outside the window at the world as I often do throughout the day. I thought to myself: the people that I have met, all of them, all of the people I have come across... does anyone of them ever think of me? Ever? Do they ever wonder how I am? Even just for a second? If they did, I wish I knew, because I feel like a shadow living life alone inside my house day after day. 

At the same time I feel that I am unworthy of friendship, community, love. Today at therapy my therapist asked me my goals. I said... to have a friend and to be a part of a small community that truly cared for me. But I have never felt or experienced that. I only know what friendships and loving communities are like from observing others. I truly pity anyone who would want to befriend me, because I think I would make the worst friend.",marsupial65,2,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/fdutq4/wondering_late_at_night/,midnight cannot sleep cannot remember last time slept night sleep tiny spurt throughout day never stay long often nightmare even stay sleeping time night example woke screaming dreaming wa eating bowl cereal looked spoon wa covered spider actually like spider sure scared bad husband reached held hand shushed calmed seems like good always feel like deserve tonight looked outside window world often throughout day thought people met people come across doe anyone ever think ever ever wonder even second wish knew feel like shadow living life alone inside house day day time feel unworthy friendship community love today therapy therapist asked goal said friend part small community truly cared never felt experienced know friendship loving community like observing others truly pity anyone would want befriend think would make worst friend,wondering late night,marsupial 65,1452,23,marsupial 65 midnight cannot sleep cannot remember last time slept night sleep tiny spurt throughout day never stay long often nightmare even stay sleeping time night example woke screaming dreaming wa eating bowl cereal looked spoon wa covered spider actually like spider sure scared bad husband reached held hand shushed calmed seems like good always feel like deserve tonight looked outside window world often throughout day thought people met people come across doe anyone ever think ever ever wonder even second wish knew feel like shadow living life alone inside house day day time feel unworthy friendship community love today therapy therapist asked goal said friend part small community truly cared never felt experienced know friendship loving community like observing others truly pity anyone would want befriend think would make worst friend wondering late night

Something is wrong with me,"I'm not one to reach out to strangers for help but something is wrong with me. I've felt empty for a long time now but I always contributed that to a lack of motivation.

 I fill this void so to speak with temporary pleasures like women, sex, working out regularly, and winning in games but they're all just distractions

Today I woke up and I was just sad and I don't even know why. I'm usually able to hold such feelings back but I woke up at 3am in the morning after going to bed a almost 1am. I was absurdly hungry and made some eggs and I just started crying. I just sat there eating these damn eggs with tears streaming down my face. There wasn't even anything wrong, I shouldn't be sad and yet I feel lower than I ever have. I've got a good family, plenty of friends, a job that is adequate for the time being, and I'm reasonably good looking to my knowledge but it's never enough. No matter how much I improve physically, no matter how much I win at DBFZ, no matter how many woman say I'm hot at the end of the day I still just feel empty.
Now I'm not here claiming to be depressed without even seeing a doctor but I don't like this. It seems like the only time I'm happy is when I'm in a relationship, but needing to constantly use a girl as a crutch to justify my existence isn't much better than being miserable by myself. I don't even enjoy life anymore I'm just going through the motions because I have to.

I don't know what to do and it frustrates me. I'm by no means suicidal but I'm tired of feeling tired. Every morning I wake up after 3 or 4 hours of sleep and lay there doing nothing. I feel useless and undesirable, I go on tinder and maybe I'll have a match or two but they just bore me with their monotonous bios and questions. It's not like I'm on there being toxic I do my best to make conversation but the thoughtless, close ended responses these girls send me annoy me and I just drop them.

Give me one good reason. I dare you.,"Give me one good reason I should not kill myself right now. The whole world is going to shit and no one can change that. The only people that could help refuse to. The world will never be a good place, it will always be on the brink. Everyone always says to just look on the bright side, but what is the point? For every good thing you could say, I could name off 3 bad things. Why shouldn’t I just end it right now and save myself the trouble. Everyone dies eventually, there is no point in being afraid of the inevitable. I house I can’t afford will be underwater anyways, if were not all dead by the time I need one.

Your typical normie trash with depression. :):,"I can't even tell when it all started, my memory has been very fuzzy past few months.So let's say 3-5 Weeks ago I *think* I feel in love for first time, I was 19. She has boyfriend so I don't even want to see her. But there was huge problem for me every time i thought about love or something similar i wanted to puke, no joke I almost puked way too many times, but after few days life became normal like usual.

Now i'm 20, after my hb I just stopped caring, I was really good student didn't even skipped school. But now I haven't been to school for 1,5 weeks. And the puking is coming back for no reason, but not as strong as it was. I feel like I lost motivation, fun and how to smile, getting worse vision, it's hard to concentrate on one thing. I'am getting easily exhausted, walking  2x slower than I usually did. I'm oversleeping no matter if i go to bed early, I still oversleep school. Also I'm listening to the one song like crazy obsessed, because it puts me at ease for some reason, even when i met up with my friends I still listen to the same song. Even when I'm going to sleep I listen to the same music. Don't know if it helps me or does it makes it worse. I started smoking 1 pack of cigs in a day,  usually 1 pack of cigs lasted about 4-5days.

I feel emotionally unstable, like my eyes get teary for no reason.  


I think I have fever lately, and don't understand if it's hot outside or cold. 

Lately i been thinking it would be nice to not feel anything, like lock all the feelings, emotions. And have peace. If u know how to lock emotions tell me ;3

I have suicidal thoughts, bcz i'm ur typical normie but i'm hanging there by small thread, I don't have courage to do something to my body.

I don't even know why tf i'm writing here. Oh, I think I know why am I writing here. Wanna be my friend? that could backstab so it would help cut that tiny thread, or ignore this post like usually i'm ignored which would put more weight and that thread wouldn't be able to support the weight.

I had ""depression"" 1-2 years ago, talked to my bestfriend made it better and it was gone not long after that. but that was like lvl 1, now i feel like it's lvl 5. Oh u say talk to my bf agian, but last night when I went to him I was afraid to show my back, when he let me go first inside.

I don't wanna see any doctors, because if i actually had depression then it would only make it worse. (like totally im not afraid of seeing docs... I wouldn't even know where to go)

I hope somebody helps to get rid of that thread. TY.

"I’m having a personal crisis so I’m gonna write to the Internet, hey welcome to my ted talk . 👋🏼","I hate my life so much I question why I’m even here sometimes , like what’s the mandatory policy to life? which way should you go? well when ur born everyone tells you the ideal path in life. Go to school, Get a job, Settle down, Start a Family and so on ... well I’m a fucking piece of shit and already started fucking up my whole life and I wanna take it back I mean for god sake I don’t even have someone I can express this crisis too I gotta go on the Internet and spill my heart out to feel content with how I’m feeling and I’m feeling fucking overwhelmed. like no one cares right? no dude, no one fucking cares and that’s when I go back to my first statement why am I here anyways? to do drugs, to have an abusive “boyfriend” that can give less of a fuck when u wake up in the middle of the night crying because you’re overthinking everything you scared yourself wide awake? Because no one should even care in the first place, but what’s a life that’s so empty no one can even comfort you? but again that’s life no ones suppose to actually give a fuck about you all you got is yourself and when you realize that it gets even more lonely. I’m to the point where I’m scared of life and don’t wanna live it but scared of what happens when it ends anyways. What if I die without really living out my full potential because I already lived it out ? was my purpose so little I didn’t even get to realize it before I died? I don’t know I just know life isn’t easy but no one said it was, it just looked that way when things were easier, when people still cared and the world seemed so curious there were a million possibilities life could take you but now you just worry away because all the people the cared are gone and now all the curiosity went away because you’ve seen all the ugly in the world and nothing looks beautiful anymore. maybe I’m just depressed and can’t ever really be happy ?

I feel unimportant.,"Not the first time I'm going through this of course, but recently it hit really hard. Like everything. I'm feeling extremely sad and tired. I want to die. Like genuinely. I feel like my life on this earth is insignificant and useless. I'm realizing I'm not happy with myself. I try to change but no matter how much I do, I can't seem to feel happy....about anything. My friends are disappearing one by one, school is getting harder and harder by the day, my anxiety has entered its way into mind, and dark thoughts cloud over anything bright. I just can't. I want to die, but I also fear what will happen after. I'm scared that maybe in the future things will get better, but because I'm dead I'll miss out. But also keep asking myself why does that matter? And the crazy thing is...my life isn't bad. Because even if I lost a few friends in my life, I also still have a lot of good ones. I have a lovely mother that cares deeply about me. I have some kind of passion that keeps me driven. So do I feel down. Because mentality, I'm unhappy. Because my friends don't trust me to tell me important things. Because I love my mom, but I want to get back on good terms with my dad to. Because I have passions yet I can't seem to pick up the pencil and write, draw, dream.  I hate this feeling. I wish I lived in my own world personalized just for me. It would be so much easier. I look at others and wonder what it's like to be like them. What is it like to be popular, associate yourself with everyone. What is it like to have a boyfriend and experience your first kiss. What is it like to have good grades in all classes. What is it like to be normal...I just want to feel worthy. I want to feel important. I want to feel genuinely happy in my life. In all honesty, I'm just really lonely. Love from your parents are great, but love from the people around you like your friends are so much more to me. Like it's expected of parents to love their kid(s), but when a friend loves you, it means something. At least for me. I'm 9th grade, only 14. I have so many years ahead of me that I'm looking forward to. But I'm always looking back on the past and never wondering or dreaming about the future. 

God....I hate myself. I want to laugh but cry at the same time because of this rant. So many mixed emotions...

This is unfair,"(I'm not a native english speaker, sorry for all the grammatical errors) 

I feel like I'm a fucking idiot and that the only reason I succeeded at school was because I was working hard, until now. I'm in my first year of college and the second semester started about a month ago but I feel like everything is falling appart. Two teachers barked at me while strongly implying that I was fucking dumb, I studied for several hours for a test and I ended up failing miserably while most of the class (who didn't study at all) found the test super easy. The worse thing is that the place I'm studying at wasn't even the one my high school teachers recommended me to go, thinking it was ""too easy"" for me, but I went to study here anyway because I felt like I wouldn't psychologically handle the option my high school teachers were recommending me to go to (in fact the day before my math finals in hs I was paralyzed on my bed for more than 30min and couldn't stop cyring thinking I wouldn't pass it despite the days I spent studying it). So currently I feel like that I'm just a dumb idiot and that everyone else is simply smarter than me, and the sole reason as to why I succeeded until now was because I cared about my grades but many didn't.

I feel like I have been LARPIng as ok - will SSRIs help?,"Basically I’ve always been a little listless and sad, even in elementary school. I got ok grades, didn’t really excel at sports. I started getting really great grades in college and joined a magazine, volunteered for the local Democrats, had a barista job etc. But still, even when I was seen as “ok” I was miserable. But, I have a lot of friends, I am kind and funny and have a nice time speaking to people. 

Now I’m three years out of post grad and I’m really suffering. I have been a poor performer at every job I’ve done post grad from the internship, agency, to the tech job I have right now. I have been put on a 30 day performance review and probably getting fired.

I don’t know what I want to do. I don’t know why I make these mistakes and fuck up my entire life. I feel like I’m broken, how will I ever make money?? I’m really on my own. I have rent and bills to pay. I could get another job, but I can’t deal with sucking and getting fired at the next one. 

I am on Prozac now so I am hoping this will help. I feel like being up for being fired was a wake up call. I am so ashamed I let this happen.

Someone killed my dog and I’m tired,"I’ve been posting here a lot recently, but it’s better then bothering my friends which is why I have. I feel bad because it probably seems like I am searching for some kind of attention, but I’m not I’m just so depressed and done with everything that I have no where else to turn. I used to text those crisis hotlines, but they never help anymore. They’re all trained to recite the same things, and it’s aggravating having the same conversation over and over again where it doesn’t really feel like my feelings are really being validated. 

Everyone goes through things. I know that as much as the next person. The world is a cruel yet charming place filled with a mixture of amazing people and people who couldn’t give two shits about others. I hate how complicated the world is, and I hate how the good things people do never seems to lessen the bad things. I have turned into such a cynical person and as time goes on I’ve found it harder and harder to see good in the world past some amazing friends and the unconditional love that animals provide. After someone killed my beloved dog though, everything just feels bleak again. He didn’t deserve the death he got, and it angers me that nobody even wants to put in the time to find out who would have done this to my best friend. “It won’t bring him back”, you’re right. It won’t, but maybe it would settle this raging anger I have inside? Maybe it would help me feel less guilty about the fact I wasn’t there for him because I was too busy fucking around in college? He gave me everything, and I gave him loneliness while someone brutally murdered him. 

I can never understand why I feel this way, and why everything in my life is going to shit. I’m so very tired and done with the world. When my mom died March 2019, I thought that was what finally broke me, but then I started to get better. I went to counseling, I leaned on my friends, and I started to cope better. I honestly thought that everything was finally looking up, but the world likes to put people like me back in their place. The more I think about it, the more I consider the fact that I’m probably meant for misery and this is why the world constantly kicks me back down when I start to get back on my feet. Coming home for spring break was a mistake as well. My father has done nothing but make me feel worse inside, and I have done nothing but be a recluse in my room watching Netflix. I have started to draw away from my support system too, not because they’ve done anything wrong but because I am tired of bothering them and they all have their own things going on in life without me coming around to be the depressed sack of shit that I am. 

I wish I hadn’t failed my suicide attempts in the past. I wish I was selfish, naive, and brave enough to try again. I wish I didn’t feel these things inside. Everyone would probably be better off without me anyway. My mom would be alive, my sweet baby would be alive, because I guarantee it was karma towards me that took them away.

I'm fine became an instant response,"Hello everyone. I'm sorry for taking your time, but I need help. 

A bit of a back story to my life: I come from a not-so-well-off family, mom left me (9at the time) and my sister (14 at the time)in my father's care (she left the country), to earn more so we could at least have a bread on the table. My sister took her frustrations on me, was being bullied at school gor not having a functional family, my father distanced himself from us... life generally sucked. I was also getting (at the time undiagnosed) migraines, which my sis and dad kept insisting that I'm lying about for attention, was even punished for it. So I stoped talking. After a long 2 years, my mother had applied for divorce, mainly due to my father's threats and mental abuse. By what I saw, my father was threatening my mother to throw me and my sis in the streets if she didn't send more money. The divorce was messy and a lot of shit throwing at eachother. It ended with my sis insisting that we need to stick toghether and since she was older, she insisted that we stay in my home country with my dad, also to spite my mother, who she now hated. The next years were rough, a lot of screaming, bullying, hitting, starving... list is long. (Just on a side note, I ended up climbing trees from windows to grab aome nasty fruit for my class mates and trading them and homework for sandwiches. Did I care I was millimeters away from dying, NAH!) Highschool was worse with the bulying, mom was still away but now, she had someone (she met the guy before the divorce, but I can't blame her. She was alone in a country where my people were, and still are, very hated). We tried to get mom to get cuatody of me, but for reasons I still can't wrap my head around, it failed. Well, her (now) husband lost his crap, and kept repeating to me and making me feel like pure shit because the process failed. It did fail because of me, yes, but as I said previously, I still don't remember why I said what I said and what happened. Years later, they decide to go to a better place, Australia! After 4 years of struggles and 3 lost cases, I finally get to get my (20 y/o) ass there with my mother. I get a boyfriend, her husband turns out to be the dickhead of the year and, long story short, I get kicked out of the house after only 1 year living with them, and end up with extremely severe anxiety because of him.

This year I turned 24. I still live with my boyfriend, who took me in. But here is where the problem is. I want to end it. So much stuff is going on, and all I can say is that it's too much. I was diagnosed (discovered by accident) with clinical depression at the age of 16, and was never addressed. I always felt like something was wrong, but every time I tried to look for help, was told to suck it up by the counselors and psycologists (admittedly, I only worked the courage to go 3 times in my life).

But in the past 3 years, I felt lost. I've been depressed and can't seem to get over it. I find no joy in life or any of the things I used to love. I have no reason, energy or motivation to move on. I drive to work, I work, put a fake smile, drive back, sleep, agrue, sleep, repeat. I feel so angry all the time, I ended hating myself more than ever, and I don't know why! I feel my partner is not there, he's stuck in his games and not engaging, and I think this is because I put too much pressure on him. I can't see my mother to talk to her, my sister doesn't talk to me and I had to go full no contact with my father. And whenever anyone asks me how I am, all I can do is repeat ""I'm fine"" and smile. I hate it... I hate it all....

Sorry for putting this all out, but I had enough of this. I want to smile, to enjoy things, but I can't... I need help. I knew I had to write this after I watched some reddit reading and was crying like an idiot at how accurate and true the things said in said reading were (the topic was ""What do you wish more people knew about depression"")

Grief Therapy/Process Group,"Another thing. My mom recommended I consider a grief therapy group or just a normal therapy group. I don't think I'm still grieving but I might be. I was in a process group many times, but I only sometimes felt okay with it.

Some of the others had an idea of what I deal with, as far as crippling depression and at the time, a bad home life. But they didn't have DID or BPD. At this point it's either one 🤦‍♂️. And the therapists, it didn't seem like they really knew how to help, like maybe they have had a personality case before but not on my level. 

I'm actually considering getting back into a group. Who knows, maybe this time they can actually help. I'm trying to not be so closed off. That's how it gets worse. Start shifting personalities and when I interact with my mom or anyone calling me, it's me but not me. Hope that makes sense.

You got this!,"I’m sure that a ton of your day is ruined by your head that always screams you’re not good enough or that you messed up.

I also know that I’m just another person behind a screen, casually typing away whilst you decide to read this. Well, I love you. Like, I love you so bad and to lose someone like you would break my heart, it’s okay to cry, it’s okay to feel bad, it’s okay to feel like giving up. But hey, I want to let you know that you’re still here. And if you’re sitting here, wanting it to be your final hours, then I’m glad that I still get to talk to you and tell you that I adore every part of you; every smile you’ve ever made, tear you’ve cried, every part of you from your head to toe makes me uncontrollably happy. 

I know you’re beautiful, happy or sad, excited or angry. You’re the most beautiful person to you, you want to know why? Because you’ve been going on for so long that you’ve shaped yourself, and you can never be wrong about yourself. You’re the most talented and awesome person I’ve met. And you continue to amaze me everyday by how you manage to wake up day after day, even with the dreaded feeling that you can’t do it, you’re so amazing that I can’t even begin to wonder why you don’t want to be here.

I'm so inconsistent on what I can and can't do. I feel like a liar.,"I can do errands and generally go to work. I can make myself go to therapy for now. I'm exhausted the whole time, and it's hard to concentrate, but I can do it. I will admit I've called into work 7 or 8 times this year though. I usually only call in once or twice a year. Whoops. 


So I can generally do what I need to do. I can't cook or maintain my personal hygiene though. I've just been microwaving leftovers that someone else made or eating fast food. I haven't showered in 4 weeks. I only brush my teeth once a day, and even then it's half-assed. I haven't brushed my hair in a few days. I lay around when I'm not running errands/working/going to therapy and it makes my body sore as hell.


I've been getting about 4 hours of sleep on average a night. I haven't hung out with anybody in about a month and a half. I text friends, but can't talk about anything other than...ugh. How I feel. It's pathetic.

I want to get better and I need advice. (Text wall alert),"29M. Depression and OCd. Started off 50mg Sertraline 3 weeks ago for two weeks; raised to 75mg one week ago. 

Dear mods, if this is not the right place, kindly let me know. If would be great if you could direct me to the right subreddit.

English is not my first language so please bear with me.

**TL:DR**
I have done a lot of reading when I procrastinate from work. I want to start a daily journal on reddit to keep track of my positives and negatives, my progress, and hopefully get advices on when I go wrong. 
I noticed that I get overtly stressed over tiny chores/work/things to do, and I'd like to tackle it via progressive increase in exposure and desensitization. Then incorporate other CBT techniques.

***Story/Background:***

I have only recently been diagnosed with Major Depressive Disorder after a close friend forced me to. Looking back now, I think I first had mild depression around 16yo.
I recall having a general apathy towards life, results, ambition, family, and friends. Any motivation is fleeting and I'd spend most of my days daydreaming. Perhaps hoping for some catastrophe in the school so that I'm no longer bored.
The depression seemingly subsided - at least I think so - as I continued on aimlessly on some path my family/culture/friends expected of me. while I'm not excelling, I'm not underperforming. I have close group of friends and we enjoy movies and outings.
It all went to hell when I was around 22/23yo. I should add that I have Contamination OCD and during my University days, decided against my better judgement that I should live with a close friend.
This proved horrible as my OCD meant I couldn't live normally or telerate their habits. I thought I had it in control and hid my oddities well. I didn't. 

My housemates at the time hated me and talked loads behind my back. All the while I was oblivious about their hatred towards me while they acted normal around me. I noticed somewhere around 3 months in. I had the chance to look through their messages and curiousity started my depression.
Reading through all those hate filled complaints and messages was painful. Having to sleep in the same room as him after was impossivle. To act civil while I moved out was tough. While we did not have a big fight because we both hated confrontation,
our 6year friendship fell apart; along with it, I resolutely cut ties with the entire group of friends that was associated with this guy. 

I believe this to be the ""event"" which kickstarted my depression. Worse still, I moved to a different place and had another falling out with another group of housemates. We started off great, even went on a trip together. In about two months, I don't recall the cause of it. But I remember they confronted me on something and I just started withdrawing from them. 
After that, I stopped going to lectures and classes. I was fired from my club because I couldn't perform anymore. (I spent the first year making it into the committee), As a result, I graduated with a subpar GPA. I've never felt worse. I feel like I disaappointed my dad, wasted his money, and failed to prove myself to those who looked down on me.
I spent the next two years isolating myself in my room, only going out for groceries if I absolutely have to. I avoided the housemates by being active at odd hours. I lied to my family that I was trying and failing to apply for jobs while the truth is I mindlessly watched seasons after seasons of brainless TV. 
I am eternally thankful that my dad supported me through this lie. He paid for my rent, food, and courses I took because I wanted to extend my visa. Oh, I was also an international student so you can imagine how much money that costed. 
I cannot begin to describe the amount of guilt I feel. 

The reason I'm even trying to get better is because of guilt. My main motivation is to make them proud of me.

When I was 27, I spent a year dodging their concerned calls. They were so worried they sent a friend over to check on me. And finally, they took a flight over themselves. My visa finally expired and I went home.
After getting home, I once again lied to them about job searching and spent a year doing my best to avoid family events and outings. Finally, last year they forcefully got me a job with my relatives and I've feel into a routine since then.
I majored in Finance and Accounting in Uni. But my results were subpar and it has been 3-4years at this point. I barely remember a thing and I can't perform. I can't even get myself to pick the knowledge back up. 
Admittedly though, the work I perform doesn't require that much. But alas, I fail to perform. I find it difficult to get myself to issue a simple invoice which takes 5muinutes tops. 

I am more and more disappointed in myself over time. I hate the job, but I haven't even sent out a single resume. The very thought of going for interviews and exposing myself as incompetent frightens me. GEtting judged by anonymous HR people makes me hate myself.
I contemplated all kinds of alternatives ie: getting a remote part time job so that I can make extra income while improving myself. Taking courses online and hopefully put me ahead of others.
Ultimately though, I have not brought myself to do any of those things. Even this reddit post took 5days of contemplating before I could do it.

I know what I should do, and people will say ""you never know if you never try"" but I can't help but imagine the negatives. Posting for help on reddit for example opens me up to judgement from random strangers, trolls, even scams, some of them incredibly damaging. 
Improving myself via courses/books/lectures can be an enormous time sink. Not to mention that what is learned may not even be useful to me in the future and may end up being a waste of time.
Currently, I spend the measly 4 hours of free time I get after getting back from work watching movies or reading novels. They're not entertaining nor boring, but they keep me sane. I dread the day that they are taken away. 


***Analysis:***

Growing up, I've been instilled with the idea that I am smart, but lazy. I believe this became a part of my core identify. I'm 29 and I don't recall ever working hard, for anything. 
I've coasted through life however, largely because my parents made me go to numerous additional tuitions, cram classes, etc. I've never done homework, mostly copied them off of friends, but have the concept repeated to you enough times and it gets carved into memory.
My results up till 15yo were always above average. 

I believe due to the circumstances, I grew up without developing any self-discipline skills. Never having an aim or goal and simply going through the motions meant I was lost the moment those guidance were taken away. Believing myself to be smart also creates a subconcious anxiety - what if I worked hard but still failed? that would mean I'm not smart.

Throughout life, I have had a panic attack twice. Once when I was 10. An art project which took me 20minutes tops was criticised and I broke down in tears and hyperventilated, having to be taken home from school.
The next was when I was 16. Around this time, I was getting progessively more apathetic at school. I struggled to get up in the morning and was often late to school. I was late for 10 times and my parents were called to school which resulted in me hyperventilating once again.
I also spent a lot of time gaming which I believe was some sort of coping mechanism similar to mindlessly watching youtube or browsing reddit. 

Not entirely sure what these events mean. But I think I can conclude that I have an inability to accept criticism or face consequences of my own actions. 

***What I want to do:***

As stated above, I want to tackle my self-disclipline, responsibility avoidance, and anxiety towards work, via progressively increasing exposure. 
I will practice mindful relaxation and attempt to associate the relaxation with the trigger(work).
I will also journal on reddit. 1. To have accountability, 2. to further dissect my thoughts, analyze the issues, solve them. and 3. to get advice.

Rock Bottom,"So I’ve suffered some heavy depression for a long time, my ex that I absolutely loved to the max just got along so well, she was so gorgeous, caring, loving and nice. She was the first girl I actually loved in a long long time. Me and her were so good for each other I thought. She knew I was suffering from depression but the crazy part is every day I was with her I was improving. She was the support I used to slowly walk up the steps to getting better. I was happy as can be to have a girl like that and for myself to climb out of that depressed hole I was in for so long. Well we got into an argument before our breakup because I thought we were being pretty distant and she blew up. She told me “I just can’t handle it anymore” and left me, I was heartbroken. She couldn’t handle my depression anymore and that’s what hurt the most. I loved her with my whole heart and now she looks at me like I’m some stranger on the streets. She never truly explained to me why everything happened and she won’t talk to me at all now. I thought I was making us stronger by opening up to her and having her help me but she never told me how much I was hurting her with my depression. She saw me improve so much and deciding to leave outta no where made no sense to me. Well here we are today, all that progress lost. I feel worse than I ever have in my life. It really fucking hurts to know the one person I loved most couldn’t handle me at my worst and left me to rot. I don’t even know what to do. I’ve deadass just been hooking up with girls at parties and drinking with my friends until I blackout. I don’t know if I can trust another girl with any of my emotions again or even trust myself to love someone again. I just wanted to give her the world but I ruined it for her and us.

No motivation in job related issues,"I would like to share my situation here presumming this has already been talked about a thousand times. First of all, forgive my English as it is not my first language (Im from Spain).

Im a 26 yo civil engineering, graduated in 2018 after 5 long years of hard study. Before this, I did a couple internships in civil engineering during college. The second one went pretty good and my boss actually wanted to hire me but I decided to leave to start the masters. After finishing it one year later and not finding any job, I ended up in an energy company, in the sales department, a field totally different than my educational background, where I stayed temporarily until I could find something in my field. The thing is, several months have passed and Im still here but also I found out I dont like this job, to the point that it has driven to a state of depression and unhappiness, but still here because of the money. The situation has been aggravated since I cant find anything else, resulting in a feel of no motivation to find other jobs and challenge myself to reach higher in life. Also, I feel that Im not as competent as I should be and that makes me feel bad too. Times is passing and Im still stuck in this conundrum with the pressure of no succeeding. I know this relies in the survival of the fittest and work hard concept but it seems to be more difficult for me. The only times I feel an extra shoot of happiness is when I practice sports or Im with my girlfriend/friends. But then this bleak mental state hits back again.

Wonder if any of you have experienced a similar situation and how have you dealt with it.

I sleep in my free periods at school and I sleep when I get home at 2:30pm. I wake up around 8pm, eat and go back to bed. My dreams are starting to be better then my own life. While I dream I feel happy, I don’t feel weighed down. I don’t feel like I’m alone. I don’t feel numb. 

I went to the school counselor for help last week. All she told me was to tell my mom how I was feeling and go see a doctor. That is the hardest thing I can possibly do. She will think it’s her fault, similar to how she took my sisters anxiety problem, and I can’t burden that on her. I don’t know what to do.

I forgot about music.,"Hi everyone, this is my first time posting in this thread so bare with me. 

So I’ve been suffering from depression on and off for years, I’m currently in an off cycle but feel kind of down/low energy but not enough for me to call it depressed. Anyway, I somehow completely forgot about music and haven’t listened to it for months. I commute on the bus, and I usually just sit and browse reddit, and when my bf drives me the radio is usually off because I get sensory overload if he tries to talk while the radio is on, so we usually just keep it off. 

Anyway, yesterday when I went in the car the Bluetooth function was on as I guess my bf was listening to his music on his way home from work, and it automatically connected to my phone and started playing my music. It was a song by the Jonas brothers (embarrassing) from like 2008, and it just made me so so happy and I started vibing so hard before I had to start work. I seriously forgot about music. I told him now that every time he drives me to work I should play my music to give me a quick happy boost before work.

Yesterday I was reminded again.,"Exactly a year ago, I turned up at my gf's (now ex) house. She wanted to be angry with me that day, she was walking towards me about to explode.... But I picked her up and ran away with her. She forgot even why she wanted to be angry with me for, we went IKEA to look at new stuff for her apartment and then we went to a cafe in which I took a selfie of us. We were so happy and cute together. That selfie popped up on my one year memories.

Fast forward to now, we've been separated since end of October last year. She doesn't talk with me, she removed me from everything except Facebook. 

I am hurting every fucking day. I remember her, I remember all the good times we had, I remember the future plans we had with each other. I don't know exactly when she turned from loving me to leaving me. But I just wish she spoke to me about any concerns she was having. I made my mistakes too by not understanding exactly what she wanted. 

I just want that happiness we had a year ago. I just miss her so much. We both wanted to get married, but I told her, once I finish school or get a job, we will get married! 

She told me she loved me and always will. I told her I loved her unconditionally. I wish somehow we could redo our relationship because we fit together so damn well.

My birthday is Saturday,"As the title says, my birthday is Saturday. The past 20 years I've never had a good birthday. My Mom was never stable, and my birthday was no exception. She'd would either view my birthday as a burden or if I didn't react in a specific way to something she would do for my birthday, she'd act as if the world collapsed around her and make a huge deal about how I don't appreciate her and she's a bad parent. (Maybe I'm just un-greatful like I've always been told) Regardless. As far back as I can remember, I've never had a good birthday. I recall vividly having a birthday party as a child, no one wanted to really play with me at my party. And I tried to isolate myself at a table when the cake was being cut (it didn't go over well with my Mom, she scalded me in front of everyone).

 As birthdays go by, all I remember are sighs, moans, and groans whenever mentioned. Last year no one wished me a happy birthday (family yes, but if history shows they don't really care) my Mom said I should celebrate her on my birthday because she's the one that gave birth to me.
 Later on I went to a pub I knew I could get into, and tried to get drunk but could barley manage. I had never felt so alone in a room of people, and it's not like it's a place I'm unfamiliar with, I knew the regulars, the regulars knew me, we're all well aquatinted. Yet still, I had never felt more alone. I ended up contacting a mate that sells me pot and got high with my weed guy. He's the only person that genuinely wished me a Happy Birthday outside my family.

 Flashforward to present day, life is pretty decent, my business is doing well, I have an album releasing soon, I have a clean bill of health (for the most part) but the realization set in...

My friend (we'll call him J) is talking in the group chat I'm in,  saying he wants to do social stuff soon, and I tell him that (we'll call him B) B and I are going to do stuff Friday and we could go out and do something all together. The chat goes cold. 

Time passes. 

Moments later, someone else in the chat (we'll call him C) says ""we should all do something Friday""...everyone lights up with agreeing with him. B then enters the chat and says my birthday is Saturday and ""we should be going out Friday for Matt"". C responds with ""that's fine"". Then everything hits me, I feel like a burden again, they probably didn't want to hangout with me, and now that B said something they feel obligated... 

I told them  ""We don't have to for me"" ""I would rather you guys have a full night"". The chats been silent since. I'm a burden, people probably hangout with me because they feel morally obligated. I'm just a waste of space.

 I'm probably being over dramatic and acting like a child seeking attention. But I know this post will waste away in the void. Nothing is genuine.

[Advice please] I feel like I'm stuck in fog and I can't work out which way to go,"Hi, 

First post on this sub in a while but I'm at a loss of what to do

I'm so fed up of feeling numb and tired and like I don't want to exist and my brain is so fogged that I cant think straight

I'm trying everything - taking the pills, doing the therapy, seeking advice and just nothing seems to be helping

I don't like my job, but I also don't want to resign without anything else lined up and all of the experts and forums and advice systems just suggest trying to 'think in a more positive manner' and I'm really trying but it just feels hopeless, I get 5 minutes of 'maybe this will be OK!' then immediately back to the grey reality

I've started applying for new jobs as my current manager has suggested that we get through year end then if I'm still feeling the same way then perhaps I should look elsewhere

so I kind of don't see the point in actually trying until year end as if I'm not staying then who am I impressing?

I have a 1:1 later so I guess I'll find out if it's time to leave

&amp;#x200B;

has anyone had this ? can anyone help?

sorry just a brain dump

I’ve never had this painful/angry feeling more in my heart than right now,"I (20 m) may or may not have depression and if I do it’s very mild, however that being said I feel this pain because I messed up the future I had with the girl I seriously would’ve hand crafted. I was madly in love with her but long distance made it not work in the end, I don’t have a problem moving on, but what’s hurts more than the break up did is finding out within a couple of months she’s met another guy, flew to him, and is planning on moving in with him. This could’ve so easily been me and her it’s painful. When we were together in person I can easily say that was the happiest 2 weeks of my life. Now I get it most people will think “just find someone else” but like some others I assume I am extremely picky.

19M Need Help Badly in Relationships,"Before I start I do got to say that I do not struggle with girls becoming interested in me since most of RateMe and many other places rate me at about 7.5-8 out of 10 for a male which is about average.
My main problem is keeping their interest in me.
A little background on me, I don't have many hobbies,dropped out of HS because of social anxiety and deppression,fathers dead,still living with mother, have no car nor license,and have no motivation whatsoever. So my life's a mess. 
So compared to most my age I'm lacking in pretty much everything, especially confidence. No friends really, so I'm mostly alone and feel like dying.
Thats why I came here, I need advice and need it bad because soon I'm afraid I'm going to hurt myself because this pain keeps breaking me down and down and I don't know where to turn.

Isolation,"Day after day. I’ve been isolated so long I’m beginning to actually despise people. I used to loathe the idea of hating all other humans but this isolation is starting to get to me.

I just expect the same from everyone I meat. It doesn’t matter anymore to me. It makes no difference weather I try or not. Everyone feels the same.

I thought I needed friends so I went out and talked to people. Nobody wants to hangout with me after school or work. I tried. My life is just pathetic no matter what I do and yes I never hang out with my so called friends.

I try way to hard with people because I just want them so badly to stay with me maybe that pushes them away.

How do I deal with parents that basically just punish me for being depressed?,"Because I am so tired of this shit. I've tried to sit them down and explains syuff to them. It didn't work. Never works. 

They don't outright say that they're punishing me because I'm depressed, but the things I do or don't do because I'm depressed get punished. I have bad grades, I'm failing in almost everything. I'm trying but with depression is really hard. You know what I get for trying? My phone and videogames taken away. I can't fall asleep at night because of anxiety. You know what I get for having nightly panic attacks? Yelled at for ""staying up all night."" You know what I get for having trouble keeping my room clean? Grounded. 

Tommorow I'm losing my phone because my grades are bad. Ignore the fact that I'm trying, yeah let's only care about a damn letter of the alphabet because THAT makes more sense than a flippin living person! t(-_-  )t

I don't even like my phone that much. I'm not one of those people who are super addicted or nothing. But my phone is a coping mechanism. Without being able to vent or watch some relaxing video to calm me down I'm probably just gonna end up cutting myself.

What should I do? Or should I just suck it up and deal with their butts for the next few years?

"I might lose the only person in the world who truly loves me, my mom, and I don’t think I can go on without her...","My mom is literary the only person in the world who truly cares about me. For everyone else, I pretty much just exist in the background, or people just use me. I have had periods of intense depression in my life and there have been so many times when I’ve contemplated self harm, but never dared to actually take action just because I thought about how much my mom loves me and how sad she would be if I hurt myself. She has done so much for me, &amp; I don’t think I could ever be half as good a mom as she was. When I was in the hospital for pretty much a whole year in tremendous pain, I never even had 1 visitor, but I didn’t really care that my friends didn’t visit me for a year, because she never left me and that was more than enough.  

The past month or so, she’s been suffering with her own health issues, which have now grown so severe the doctors are almost positive it’s cancer or ALS. I’m trying to keep my hopes up that this is just some kind of short term problem, but every day it worsens, the more I can’t stop myself from thinking about the possibility of life without her. And that’s a thought that I cannot bear. Life would be pointless and I would truly be all on my own.

I want to stop existing,"I have made small effort in trying to fix my self esteem, but it’s so hard and it feels impossible because I believe all my negative thoughts. I think I’m ugly, huge, boring, and unfunny person. I put up a good front when I talk to people that I don’t even think anyone knows how much I just want to stop living. I haven’t made any suicide attempts, but some nights I start thinking about how lonely I am. No one in high school liked me very much, lots of rumors would be spread about me. So after I graduated I didn’t keep many friends. I get it though, I’m boring. I don’t even daydream anymore about me living in a better mental state, surrounded by fun loving people. I thought it was stupid for me to live inside my head, so I stopped. But that was one of the things that would help me fall asleep better. I used to be a hopeless romantic but now I am convinced no one will ever love me. I don’t have crushes anymore because thinking about relationships sucks because I always put myself under a microscope and find everything wrong about me. I am alone, I can’t even bring up conservations about my mental health to my mom because she thinks I’m doing it for attention. I subconsciously probably am. I just don’t want to be here anymore, why did I have to be born. If I was really depressed I would have killed myself already, I don’t know why I feel like this. I don’t think I’ll get better it’s been this way for almost 3 years.  It’s so unfortunate that I exist and can’t disappear from peoples minds.

"I tried falling in love, now I'm even more broken","I'm 24 years old. I've consisrently failed at pursuing all my dreams. A year or so ago I broke up with my ex girlfriend. I met her 2-3 years ago, memory is getting foggy, I'm sure y'all understand. Before that I was lied to, cheated on by the few other girls I'd been with. She dropped into my life out of nowhere. I met her online and at first we were both apprehensive... I didn't want to get hurt more but she was there for me. She helped me see therapists for my disorders, she helped me get out of bed and go to work every morning. We lived in different timezones and she would stay up through the night to wake me up in the morning to hear my voice. I fell in love with her. She said she loved me too. I flew her to where I lived and she took two weeks off her work which she takes seriously. She maintained she loved me, things were even better than she had hoped. After she left everything started slowly crumbling. I was getting worse without her and she couldn't deal. She couldn't deal being away from me, according to her, and I could see my disorders were bringing her down, even when I was on antidepressants. She eventually broke up with me. And it's been a year, and I'm living with someone else. She's living with someone else too. I don't feel anything anymore guys... I just try to not cry every day. I'm not fucking happy. I miss her and we text occasionally, she knows what she wants, and it's not me. I've lost interest in even sex now, worse than with the SSRIs. I really don't know how to keep going. I tried moving on, I tried changing homes, I tried pursuing passions but everything just falls short. I feel like I'm just pretending I care about things in hope that I eventually will and this torture will end.

I just want it all to end,"Last year i got done with my senior highschool year and despite working soo hard for since june till the next june, studying hours daily i ended up falling short of the percentage i needed to enter the major i wanted to which is computer science and let myself and my family down. I had to major in finances since it was my only choice and i am hating it. Moreover i am hating the fact that i am living with myself as a failure, i never achieve anygoals that i want and i never get anywhere. I have OCD which i am taking medication and therapy for and it has been kicking in so hard lately with all the negativity making me go crazy. I am always depressed and my family is disappointed from me. I just feel like a burden now on every body around me i always have breakdowns and my family always blasts me for it. All my relatives are engineers and other good majors and jobs and i am stuck in this. i am sorry if my writing isnt organized but i am so disoriented right now. I feel like if i just die i would relief every body around me from my burden and relief them from the shame of having me. I cant stand living with my self knowing that i an a complete and utter failure. I dont deserve anything. I will never get anywhere in life i just want it all to end. i just want to die i cant live with myself anymore. And it is a relief knowing that when i die no one will care as i dont want to hurt anyone. I have no friends, my family wish they didnt have me. My relatives didnt even care to call or visit me when i was hospitalized after a cycling accident. I just wish to die and be forgotten instead of living in misery and burdening my family.

I have heart disease but Ihave slowly been losing weight and eating better. My doctor asked me the routine questions:

“What degree are you graduating with?”

“Is there good money in that? Enough to buy a home?” 

Then she says 

“It doesn’t matter what degree you get, if you become an engineer, or how much money you plan on getting.  You’ll be dead so early that you won’t be able to even attempt to achieve or enjoy any of it”

I have visions of seeing myself die in various ways...,"I walk my dog, I look in the street and see myself getting hit by a car...

I go to the beach, and I watch as my body falls off of a nearby cliff into the water...

I look in the mirror, and I see me slitting my own throat with a sadistic smile on my face...

I walk down the street and see a man run up to me and shoot me in the stomach...

It happens ALL THE TIME. It’s scary, but I see it so much that I’m kind of desensitized by it, if that makes sense. But every once in a while it scares me to death.

the only thing keeping me alive is my plan to die in 2 weeks,"I really cannot do this anymore. It's like my suffering has spread onto those I love and I'm at a point where I can no longer put on a fake smile. I can no longer pretend that I'm okay because I'm not. I  hate seeing my friends and family hurt for me and it breaks my heart seeing them feel so helpless.

My life is such a failure and I've already ruined it so much that there's literally no point in going on. I fall asleep crying every night because I realized that I'm the problem here and my existence only makes the lives of others worse. People keep telling me how much they love me and how much I have to live for and while that does mean something to me, it's not enough to make me want to live. With my existence, I hurt people and with my death, I'll hurt people, so what's the point? At least if I die eventually the hurt will begin to fade (or so I hope). I just want the people I love to live a life without worries or hurt and all I do is hurt them. 

I have 2 more weeks to finish this quarter of school. Before I decide to end my ""wonderful"" life I just want to finish this one quarter, not that I'm going to achieve anything. I just want to push through these last 2 weeks but even that's been extremely difficult. I cry every single day in agony that I have to live another day and it's so hard trying to even study for exams because I have no ability to concentrate or take anything in.

Why can't I find treatment?,"I was going to a doctor who just wanted to prescribe medication, but none of it seemed to really help. And my previous doctor was the same. I tried with no luck to self refer to some mental health places but nothing panned out. I changed insurance recently and had to switch doctors. They referred me to a place which both me and my doctor were under the impression would handle medication and therapy.

So I scheduled a needs assessment and thought, ""finally."" But after the needs assessment they just wanted to refer me to more places. I tried calling most of them and they were either full with long wait lists, no longer existed(maybe wrong number provided) or no answer.

I called my doctor back and they sent a referral to another place, and told me I should get a call within the week. Its been 3 weeks now and no call.

"No matter which path in life I take, I will be unhappy","I don't know if anyone will even read this, but I need to vent somewhere. For some background, I am now living back in my home state, in an unhappy situation, because I wanted to come back and finish up school and so that I could be around my family.

Originally, I moved away for a few years. I was unhappy before I left my home, and I found real happiness out west in Colorado for a time. I began traveling around, working seasonal jobs at ski resorts and in national parks, and I really enjoyed it for awhile. I just wanted to keep traveling, but then the realities of life set in.

I didn't have a degree, I wasn't in any sort of high-paying jobs, and I was struggling to make it paycheck to paycheck. Despite all of this, I was still relatively happy. Eventually though, I realized that I missed my family and my old friends terribly, and decided to move back so that I could be around them and get an education.

Fast forward to now. I'm 26 years old, living at my dad's house, working in an unfulfilling job that pays terribly, while I wait for my first semester of school to start. I feel like an absolute failure because I won't even have a degree until I'm 30. I won't start my career until almost a decade after everyone else did. I miss what I was doing and the places I traveled through so terribly much. I feel like I'm missing a part of myself by being back here and I left it out west.

I have considered moving back, but I have no idea how I would afford it, and I don't see any career opportunities for me outside of dead-end, low paying jobs out there. Also, if I don't do school now, then I don't think I ever will. If I moved back out, I would just go back to seeing my family once a year for two or three days, and I love them so much. That was the hardest part of being out there, and I want to be able to see them regularly. I'm extremely close to my parents, and I don't want to miss a moment with them, because I realize that they will be gone some day. Every moment with them is precious.

But, I feel like I'm slowly dying here. I am turned into a depressed, cynical person who cannot see the good in life anymore. Everything is negative, and the people around me in this state are so ignorant and offensive. I don't belong here, and I don't know what to do. Grappling with this indecision has been so unbelievably hard on me.

If I stay, then I will just become more and more unhappy. If I leave, then I will never be able to see my parents, and I will be unhappy again because of that. I can't take it anymore. Looking ahead, my life seems like it is going to be one endless stream of depression and I honestly just want it to end.

Changing thought patterns via therapy different than wishing away depression?,"I have never understood the distinction between therapy like CBT which tries to train you to think more positively to reduce or eliminate depression, which is sort of the underlying belief of most psychology thinking, versus the sentiment that one cannot think themselves out of depression.

I (19M) feel like I'm reaching a breaking point.,"I've been feeling depressed af the last few months, it sort of feels like a relapse after about 6 months of a reasonably healthy mental state.

Basically I feel physically drained of energy all day, I have zero motivation to study or try in any way whatsoever in college. I'm doing a notoriously tough course and barely passed my Christmas exams. I come home exhausted but when I go to bed I just become really agitated and irritated. My heart starts pounding and I struggle to breathe, I can't get comfortable and even if go to bed exhausted at 8/9pm I wouldn't get to sleep until 2/3am.  However in the mornings I struggle so much to get out of bed, I feel like there's almost zero point getting up anyway as I wouldn't even miss out on anything. I end up missing so many of my lectures simply becuase I cannot bring myself to get out of bed. I still live at home going to college but if I lived by myself without parents I could see myself just staying in bed/my room for days at a time. 

Every day passes by in a sort of blur for me, I feel like I almost have a depersonalization disorder as I just operate in autopilot. I feel like a shell, it's almost like I'm just empty inside; I don't feel emotions, everything just feels monotonous and numb.  Honestly I really just don't give a fuck about anything anymore. I used to have passions like playing music/sport/reading/films etc but nothing excites me anymore. I feel like I don't really have an emotional outlet, it's like I'm just existing day-to-day without actually living. Since I find close to zero pleasure in general life I self-medicate with weed; I guess it's just a coping mechanism in order to feel something other than numb. I also think I have memory loss, as the last couple months have really blurred, I honestly don't know where the time has gone or what I've been doing in that time. 

I also have really really bad eating habits, I don't generally eat breakfast and then could go the day without eating. However when I come home I often would binge until I struggle to breathe. 

I also feel socially exhausted every day I have to go into college; pretending to be someone I'm not is mentally draining as I feel like I'm putting on a fake persona just to mask the numbness when all I wanna do is just go to bed/get high. This is probably part of the reason I avoid going to lectures. 

This all eventually caused me to go to the student couseling services in my college sometime last week, however I feel like I wasnt as honest as I should have been regarding my situation, I was definitely making it out to be less severe than it actually is. They set me up with counselling sessions that start in 3 weeks. 

However I feel like my ability to function has been severely impaired in the last few days. Tonight I felt the urge to self-harm for the first time and honestly if I had clean razors I would already have done so. I don't think I can wait 3 weeks for my counselling appointment, I feel like I should go to a GP/psychiatrist and see what they think. I feel like I just want someone to tell me exactly what I have, I'm 99% sure it's depression, and perhaps symptomatic  insomnia/a binge eating disorder. I guess part of me still denies it's depression despite me knowing that it almost certainly is and I feel like I need a medical professional to tell me how it is in order for me to be able to work on getting better. I guess I also want to see if they think that medication could help too. Ultimately I just want treatment as soon as possible, something concrete I can show to myself to tell me that I'm taking steps to improve myself as atm I feel so lost in life, and I feel like a breakingpoint might come soon unless I change things. 

I really don't know where to go from here, I guess this post is just a reflection. Maybe I just want to get my thoughts down somewhere but if anyone has any advice obviously I'd rly appreciate that: like most ppl here I just wanna feel normal again. :( If anyone would be willing to talk about things a bit more in detail I'd appreciate a pm.",taway0403,2,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/fdlr0n/i_19m_feel_like_im_reaching_a_breaking_point/,feeling depressed af last

I don't do anything,"I've got a lot of work to do, but I can't do anything. The voice in my head says that even if I tried, I wouldn't get anywhere, I wouldn't succeed. That's why I always delay things, even though I have to do it at that time. The worst part is that I'm aware of this situation, and I'm still not doing anything about it. Time's going too fast and idk what to do. My anxiety gets worse at times like this and when it gets worse, I can't even sleep, let alone do anything.

I'm so tired of feeling this way, but like I said, I don't know what to do. I don't have anyone to talk to and I really need advice.

Disappointed,"Disappointed
That's the one word I would use to sum up the way I feel. Disappointed in everything. 

Myself, for being...mediocre. That's the only word that comes to mind when I consider my life. I've been given so many gifts and people that love me, and I waste it all. I don't quite understand what's wrong with me, but I know there's something not clicking right in my brain. People talk about a certain fire behind someone's eyes, a drive that pushes them to work hard for their goals. I dont have that. I'm not passionate about anything. I find myself with no motivation to do anything, even doing days without eating. Some days I'll be how I used to, full of energy and making people laugh, but, as quickly as it appeared, it's gone. I'm back to laying in bed all day, not speaking to anyone, not doing anything that I'm not required to. The only thing that impresses me anymore is how easily I lie to my own family. As soon as they call, I become this other person. The person they want me to be, who does well in school and never had any issues. 

I don't feel joy anymore. Not a trace of genuine happiness, other than the aforementioned 'good days'. Even the things that used to make me happiest, like Christmas, now just seem annoying and pointless. I can't sleep, often laying awake for hours on end. 

Fuck, I miss him. I miss my Da. I would give anything in the world for 5 more minutes with him. He was everything to me, my whole world. I loved him with everything in me. You could come to him in the worst possible situation, and he would tell you what you needed to hear, and you would always come away feeling better. But now he's gone. He left, leaving a mess that my family has yet to fix, and now I'll never see him again. Never hug him, or hear his roaring laughter. I'll never again have him look me in the eyes and say ""I'm proud of you, son."" And that breaks my heart. Sometimes I go back and listen to old voicemails, just to hear his voice. 

I'm disappointed in my family, some more than others. We all came together as a family for the funeral, and not even 24 hours later they're already fighting. I don't understand what I have to do to let them know I need help. I shouldn't be too hard on them, but if my friend who hasn't seen me in 3 years can discern I'm struggling over the phone, surely my own family could tell. I told them I wasn't ready to go back, that I couldn't handle it, but they didn't listen. I've never once in my life had real freedom. Freedom to choose what I want. Thats not exactly true. Theres 2 options: do what they want, or be on my own. 

Disappointed in those around me. Now, I could never blame anyone here for my problems, but damn if they can't tell. There are people here who's job it is to identify people who are struggling. They haven't approached me, nor have any of my 'friends' here. I went to the counselor once, and after an hour of talking, he told me that he thought my Das death might have had an impact on me. No shit. Say what you will about my high school, but I'm more comfortable telling anyone there that I'm struggling than I ever would be here. 

I don't know where something went wrong, where I lost my drive, but I want to fix it. I want to be happy again, but every day that seems farther away. Every day, I feel less like myself and I just want it to end.",howdoiexpressemotion,0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/fdrbq9/disappointed/,disappointed one word would use sum way feel disappointed everything mediocre word come mind consider life given many gift people love waste quite understand wrong know something clicking right brain people talk certain fire behind someone eye drive push work hard goal dont passionate anything find motivation anything even day without eating day used full energy making people laugh quickly appeared gone back laying bed day speaking anyone anything required thing impress anymore easily lie family soon call become person person want doe well school never issue feel joy anymore trace genuine happiness aforementioned good day even thing used make happiest like christmas seem annoying pointless sleep often laying awake hour end fuck miss miss da would give anything world 5 minute wa everything whole world loved everything could come worst possible situation would tell needed hear would always come away feeling better gone left leaving mess family ha yet fix never see never hug hear roaring laughter never look eye say proud son break heart sometimes go back listen old voicemail hear voice disappointed family others came together family funeral even 24 hour later already fighting understand let know need help hard friend seen 3 year discern struggling phone surely family could tell told ready go back handle listen never life real freedom freedom choose want thats exactly true 2 option want disappointed around could never blame anyone problem damn tell people job identify people struggling approached friend went counselor hour talking told thought da death might impact shit say high school comfortable telling anyone struggling ever would know something went wrong lost drive want fix want happy every day seems farther away every day feel le like want end,disappointed,doi express emotion,3340,12,doi express emotion disappointed one word would use sum way feel disappointed everything mediocre word come mind consider life given many gift people love waste quite understand wrong know something clicking right brain people talk certain fire behind someone eye drive push work hard goal dont passionate anything find motivation anything even day without eating day used full energy making people laugh quickly appeared gone back laying bed day speaking anyone anything required thing impress anymore easily lie family soon call become person person want doe well school never issue feel joy anymore trace genuine happiness aforementioned good day even thing used make happiest like christmas seem annoying pointless sleep often laying awake hour end fuck miss miss da would give anything world 5 minute wa everything whole world loved everything could come worst possible situation would tell needed hear would always come away feeling better gone left leaving mess family ha yet fix never see never hug hear roaring laughter never look eye say proud son break heart sometimes go back listen old voicemail hear voice disappointed family others came together family funeral even 24 hour later already fighting understand let know need help hard friend seen 3 year discern struggling phone surely family could tell told ready go back handle listen never life real freedom freedom choose want thats exactly true 2 option want disappointed around could never blame anyone problem damn tell people job identify people struggling approached friend went counselor hour talking told thought da death might impact shit say high school comfortable telling anyone struggling ever would know something went wrong lost drive want fix want happy every day seems farther away every day feel le like want end disappointed
The only time when I feel fine is when I sleep,"When I am awake my anxiety is there every moment, and it can be overwhelming. I feel my heart beating faster and my breathing becomes a mess, I just feel my whole body feel uncomfortable when I am awake. The only time where I don't feel panic, where I don't feel as much negative feelings, is when I lie in bed and my mind is getting ready to sleep. I don't know how long it takes to fall asleep, but if it took 10 minutes, then those 10 minutes is the best I ever felt in the whole day. I know that its not good to sleep so much, but I understand why some people would choose to sleep a lot when they are depressed. I look forward to that peaceful 10 minutes.

I don't really think if one phrase could even describe how destroyed am I,"I don't even know how to start, I always thought about one thing that always tortures my brain: Everyone are the same, but I am not. When I was a child, being child was the perfect excuse to hide my condition: I don't know how to talk to people, I don't know how to prolong a conversation, I don't know anything about being sociable. In the other hand, I was (and I am) really smart, but I don't really qualify myself about something special, because people are so stupid to think about being self-centered, instead of thinking about the personality itself, that's maybe one of the thing I don't even comprehend about society, well I continue, being able to do whatever you want its something amazing, I felt (I feel) I got the most powerful superpower, being able to think about something interesting to do and make it real, make it like I was professional on something, but if you can't even talk, even express yourself, your brain, all of your amazing ideas are taking down to trash, to something miserable, how much kids, teens worried about the things other people say (I worry too), but I'm 100% sure they can shine if they are with the correct people, ask me, I'm 22 now, in 22 years, Why didn't I find anyone like me?, anyone who I can talk about interesting things and not about superficial and stupid things, anyone who takes the life like a poetry, with right values, anyone who understands me, anyone who I can be myself

I hated my school partners, and they always thought about things on how to ruin my day, I didn't understand why being so small, being so tiny they were so disrespectful to each other, I lived on a city that I can't even pronounce it's name because is the reason of all my misfortunes, people so damn vulgar, so damn low they can't even teach their kids how to be kind, how to be respectful to anyone. I learn about pride, that keep me away from bullying, they don't even know why they bullied me, bullies tend to attack people about their body, about if they are stupid, about a condition, they just attack me because it was me, and I know, they smell it like dogs, possessed maybe, because I didn't find a reasonable reason to understand what they bullied me, but in the middle of that, I thought why just can't we be friends? Why do we attack to each other? Only because I can't be vulgar like you? They is the reason why I hate my ethnicity, this stupid language called spanish talked only by freaking stupid people, because I learned about they, every single piece of word they say, why my country is infested with third-world-people, they are way too worried about lgbt and inclusiveness, why didn't they included me on society?

There was a guy, Alvaro C. was and still is his name, he was the most disgusting, profane, putrid and revolting person I ever met, he was just a compulsive masturbator, obsessed with pornography, I remember when he checked the teacher computer just for looking for sexual content, when he masturbates in class, I couldn't care less about his life except for one thing, he didn't let me breathe one miserable day when I was in school, he just looked for me to having some daily fun, let's make this piece of s**t even more s**t than he actual is he thought, I cried trying to understand why me? what did I got in myself that makes me so despreciable?, he didn't know about what thing inserted in my mind, now I'm him, now it's me who have a problem with porn addiction

When I was 14, I decided to play guitar, not only that, now I'm feeling that I'm able to put some music on the radio with some effort and money, but I don't have the energy left to do something, actually I just don't have energy to do nothing more than just laying in my bed and watching these repulsive videos that I hate, but I can't left behind for some reason, this thing is just consuming my brain, all my abilities, my smartness, my heart, my soul, I want to leave it but I'm thinking that I have no reason to do that, because for me now life is just pointless, is just about being stupid, thinking stupid, talking stupid, living stupid, don't try to be some special for this world because this world will take you and make you descend down to their level, descend down to hell, and if you make it to the top maybe it's because you are like they by default, I got ideas, still have some beautiful ideas, but I'm alone, waiting for someone to help me that will never come, suicide is just a boring option, I know if I just die no one will notice and I hate that, I will not take that option because I don't want to give them the pleasure of that, it's freaking hypocrite when these criminals of society cry to a fallen relative, cry is a emotion just for good people so you know now why they don't cry me but instead cry to themselves, you may not believe in God, but you can make sure the Devil is in one of us waiting just for destroy everyone else and every piece of you, disguised as everything you know, the more you think everything is normal, the more you are far away from

Save Me,"I... I can't imagine dying, it's not something that I want.

And yet these thoughts they still exist and seem to scare and creep and haunt.

Plenty of ways to go about it, some are easy, some are not.

I let the feelings fill me up till I become too deep in thought.





I'm standing on a bridge, I'm looking down at frigid water.

I have come here with a thought, and intentions of self-slaughter.

But when I stand up on the railing, I want someone to come,

Someone to shout and pull me down, stop me from doing something dumb.





I want a stranger's embrace, to reassure me it's okay.

To tell me that it isn't worth it, that the trip's only one-way

I want to bawl and breakdown, in the arms of the unknown.

So I can maybe feel cared about, and not feel so alone...





Now I'm in my room, with a note and rope in hand.

Thinking I'll finally fall through, let my thoughts and mind disband.

But when I step off of that stool, I want my mom to come rush down,

To pull me out my quiet guillotine, and stop my silent drown.





Oh, she'd probably hug and sob, knowing what I had tried to do.

Glad she ran down stairs to check on me, as if had been on cue.

That night would stay with her forever, make her always high alert,

To stop her child from disappearing, or end up permanently hurt.






However in both situations, I would simply end up dead.

That is, if I could follow through with all these thoughts that haunt my head.

Alas I am not suicidal, just a faking wannabee,

Cause I don't actually want to die, I just want someone to save me...",SexuallyConfusedEgg,10,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/fdr9h5/save_me/,imagine dying something want yet thought still exist seem scare creep haunt plenty way go easy let feeling fill till become deep thought standing bridge looking frigid water come thought intention self slaughter stand railing want someone come someone shout pull stop something dumb want stranger embrace reassure okay tell worth trip one way want bawl breakdown arm unknown maybe feel cared feel alone room note rope hand thinking finally fall let thought mind disband step stool want mom come rush pull quiet guillotine stop silent drown oh probably hug sob knowing tried glad ran stair check cue night would stay forever make always high alert stop child disappearing end permanently hurt however situation would simply end dead could follow thought haunt head ala suicidal faking wannabee cause actually want die want someone save,save,sexually confused egg,1563,7,sexually confused egg imagine dying something want yet thought still exist seem scare creep haunt plenty way go easy let feeling fill till become deep thought standing bridge looking frigid water come thought intention self slaughter stand railing want someone come someone shout pull stop something dumb want stranger embrace reassure okay tell worth trip one way want bawl breakdown arm unknown maybe feel cared feel alone room note rope hand thinking finally fall let thought mind disband step stool want mom come rush pull quiet guillotine stop silent drown oh probably hug sob knowing tried glad ran stair check cue night would stay forever make always high alert stop child disappearing end permanently hurt however situation would simply end dead could follow thought haunt head ala suicidal faking wannabee cause actually want die want someone save save

I guess this is me venting? Not sure what to call it.,"TL;DR: I'm feeling really down, have shut myself away, and don't know how to get through this anymore.

Hi, I'm Brendan. Im a 27(soon to be 28) y/o male, and I don't know what to do anymore. I've been trying to avoid posting because in the end I feel it doesn't matter anyway, but I have to say something.

This isn't a cry for help, I wouldn't accept any because I feel I should be able to get over my problems by myself.

I was diagnosed wish major depressive disorder at 15, then obsessive compulsive behavior at 23, with generalized anxiety coming in at 25. I know I cannot simply get over my issues because they're in my brain. I also know that it's all in my head, that's why they're called mental problems.

To get to the point, I'm lonely. I have like 3 friends, but I know if I had a girlfriend I would still be lonely. When I had one, who was amazing, I still was feeling alone. I really just think that it's all going so bad because I deserve it, and that it will make the good times seem better.

I'm not patient when it comes to my feelings. I want this feeling to go away more than anything. I've basically sheltered myself in my room for the past year and a half. I don't remember how to talk to people or act in public. I have a job, but only because I'm striving to not be homeless.

I'm sorry if anything I said upsets anyone somehow, I really needed to say something. I'm starting to lose the battle in my head again. I feel like I've been fighting it for much too long. I want to just give up fighting and give in to the sickness taking me over.

I can’t - Depression fatigue? Is there such a thing?,"Been married about 17 years, my wife has had varying levels of depression right throughout that, and I think I’ve got ‘depression fatigue’. 
I just made up that term, I’m sure theres probably a real medical term for it.
I just can’t deal with it anymore. It’s consumed every piece of happiness, smile, laughter and fun I’ve had in me. We’ve got 4 kids and it’s affecting them too.

I can’t deal with her complaining anymore
I can’t deal with her moods anymore
I can’t deal with her abuse anymore
I can’t deal with being used as her verbal and emotional punching bag
I can’t keep doing everything around the house
I can’t keep dreading every time my phone rings and it’s her, wondering what it will be about, will she be losing her shit on the other end of the phone,
I can’t keep coming home and wondering what sort of mood she’s in.
I can’t dread her waking up in the morning, knowing she’s in a shit mood 13 out of 14 days
I can’t walk in or out of the house, say hi/bye, give her a kiss to be told to fuck off, I hate you, you’re a piece of shit, a cunt, or that she wishes I get hit by a train, have a car accident or similar.
I can’t be told I don’t do anything around the house, or about all the things I ‘don’t do’.
I can’t be told that I’m a shit father, and about all the things I don’t do with them, even though I’m with them every night and weekend when she’s at work, I take them to school, make their lunches and dinner.
I can’t be told how crap my family is, and that my dad who dies 3 years ago was a lazy piece of shit.
I can’t fight with her every time my mum is in town and wants to see us and the kids, especially as she’s moving to the same town this week so she can see more of us.
I can’t be told how she doesn’t have any time for herself, yet she directly controls how she spends every minute of her day.
I can’t her her complain about the house anymore, no it’s not a display home, but it’s FAR from dirty!
I can’t hear her complain about the kids and how much they fight - where do you think they learnt that behaviour from?
I can’t hear about finances, when we spend SO much on takeaway food or fresh food that gets thrown out because it’s gone off uneaten.
I can’t hear her complain about her weight, you got the op done, lost heaps of weight and haven’t been to the gym to tone.
I can’t hear her complain about not going to the gym and having paid for the membership for the last 8 months, you’re in control of your days and how you spend it.
I can’t hear you say to me I’m different towards you today/tonight, did you forget how you told me today what a piece of shit I am, you wish you never met me and you’re going to go and find someone to give you attention.
I can’t be told how much I repulse you when we have sex, and that you have to think of someone else to orgasm.
I can’t be told that I’m just here to look after the kids and support you and them financially.

Psychic Deadness depression conflation?,"I, like I think many people here, like to sometimes exist in a fantasy world, where we are worshiped or heroes or even the creators, as a means of escaping.

 I, like I suspect many here are, am a massive anime and fantasy nerd, but also am very into science explaining stuff. 

The other night I types ESP / Psychic into Google Scholar and I stumbled upon a great book called Psychic Deadness- Michael Eigen, which so aptly describes a lot of the sentiment I can feel from this sub.

Tomorrow is my thesis defense and I am not doing anything,"I tried making progress on my thesis from a few weeks back but it has been so difficult, not just in a mental state. Ever since I got depression, I have the hardest time focusing on stuff. Even if I tried to focus on doing stuff I enjoy doing, I can't do it for long, my head gets dizzy. I can't read lines in a book without getting my vision blurry and end up forgetting which line I was supposed to read.

And I also have the hardest time to recall short term and long term memories. These days I would have lunch and half an hour later I would ask myself ""wait, did I eat lunch today ? or was it yesterday ? Do I need to eat again ?"". I can't tell which day of the week is it. I currently don't have the two things that are absolutely crucial for my productivity, which is concentration and memory. I try to bring myself up but it is so freaking hard when my body can't respond back.

I guess now I just have to do what I can and try to brace myself for tomorrow, for I am sure to be destroyed during my defense tomorrow. I am scared sh\*tless because I know one of the professors can be ruthless and heartless, can only imagine how heartbreaking it will be tomorrow. I want to pat myself on the back and say ""Its okay, its gonna be fine. You've done your best against all odds. If you fail tomorrow its fine, you can try again next time"" but I can't bring myself to do that, and I am scared and I feel alone.

I'm drinking myself to death and it is causing my family pain,"The reason I drink is to self medicate because I saw my friend pass away in a car accident when I was 19. We were both stupid and I challenged him to a race using our parents cars. Basically, he understeered into a tree. I have tried therapy but it didn't work for me. I was also diagnosed with PTSD and depression. I stopped taking my prescription because it didn't work for me. I feel that I have blood on my hands because I was the one who made him do it. 

My parents and grandfather came to me and told me that they were worried about my drinking problem. I sometimes drink a bottle of Vodka a day. I just want to drink myself to death. My granddad tried to relate to the situation by telling me about the things he was in Vietnam. I walked out because I was upset about everything.

"I know this will get lost, but I'm just so tired of being alive.","Every day now for years, it's been exactly the same. Wake up, attend online school, get scolded by my teachers and parents for my poor grades and how slow I am, spend hours doing homework I struggle with, be overwhelmed and stressed about my life, cry, go to bed, and repeat. On the weekends I'll either just sit in my room all day watching YouTube or nap all day because I can't even find the energy to get out of bed and do anything. I can't even find the will to finish my overwhelming amounts of homework. I don't enjoy anything anymore. I don't have any skills, talents, or interests, and I can't even get a job since I live in the middle of nowhere and I'm terrified of learning to drive. I don't even really know anything about the real world. I'm just a husk of a person who rots in isolation in my room all day fantasizing about dying. I am so desperately alone and I feel like a absolute worthless moron. My entire life I've never even had one friend to talk or confide in. Every time in the past when I was going to public school and tried to make friends with people I always fucked up and made myself look idiotic because I never understood how to talk to people and form connections with them. I can't even make online friends. No one cares about me, not even my own parents. Every time I try to have a conversation with my mom, (who is the only thing keeping me from not being totally socially isolated as I am pathetically desperate just to have someone talk to me since I have no one else) she doesn't even bother to pretend to listen to me. She has more important things to do than spare a moment of her time talking to me. I get it, but I wish she didn't make it so obvious. 

I just am so tired of trying to survive each day of hell by myself. I don't see how life can get any better when I'm already incapable of achieving anything. It doesn't help either that I'm so scared about the future. I don't know what I want out of my life, and even if I did, I'd have no idea how to get there with how far I've fallen behind everyone else and how unmotivated I am. I'm scared of fucking my life up even more than I already have. Maybe it'd be easier at this point for me to just drown myself to prevent having a depressing future where I'm suffering even more. I don't really know.

Why can’t I grow up? (Maybe you’ll relate),"Had a birthday, I am 22 now. I still live with my parents. Got kicked out of my state university and am at community college now for the second year. Take maybe 1-2 classes a semester (anymore and I’ll be overwhelmed). Work about 10 hours per week at a data entry job my parents work at. Still come home and put off doing any homework or studying so I can play video games. Skip class a lot. Watch the same few shows over and over. Don’t have a concrete idea for my future or what I’m going to do with it. 

Still laugh at humor I found funny when I was in my teens. Lie to all my old friends (haven’t made a single new one in college, all friends are from high school or before) about how my life is going. Don’t exercise often (genetics allow me to still be skinny, expect for my face which accumulates fat beneath my chin. Not a good look.) Self conscious about how skinny I am and never wear short sleeves in the summer. Social anxiety about my appearance.

It might not make sense to a lot of people but it really gave me perspective and made me feel a little better!,"I had a thought today while I was mulling over what a shitty mood I’ve been in lately. Basically I was thinking about how my latest depressive episode was lasting longer than usual, about how tired I was and all I wanted to do was take a long ass nap and just chill for a few days- I wanted to not have to deal with all the responsibilities on my plate right now, and thought about how great it would be if I could have someone “take my shift” for my life this week. 
And it just popped into my head that maybe that’s what happens when we get thrown back into depressive episodes- maybe someone has been feeling so shitty for such a long time that the universe has decided to give them a break and I’m the one that’s been chosen to “take the shift”, bearing some heavy emotions, etc. And that when I’m lucky enough to have some free time for an afternoon snooze or just to watch a movie, someone else is taking my “shift” for a while.

Anxiety has ruined me.,"Everything I've had in life has slowly been ruined by anxiety.  


Friends I used to talk with constantly are now either gone or distant because I just can't keep up with them anymore. I've separated from so much of my family because of my own choices and shitty habits. I'm unable to beat them. For years I've wanted to reconnect with the people I shut out, but I've become trapped in a self-destructive cycle where I'm too ashamed to admit my problems to the same people I just want to make proud.  


I've lost every job the same way. Whether it's throwing up in the bathrooms at work or failing to muster up the courage to even call in sick, it finds its place in the worst possible ways without fail.  
It's been like this for years. I live at home with no job, no car, not even highschool degree four years after I should have graduated. I don't even have a driver's licence.   
I've been hospitalized twice, both times in relation to this problem that just won't go away. Nothing works.

Emotional hurricane,"So this is my first reddit post, so bear with me. I am not suicidal, so I don't want anyone to think I am in dire need of assistance. I don't want to scare anyone. But I do have depression, for 2-3 years now. I wrote a journal entry today that kind of illustrates how i constantly feel. 24/7. I've been journaling on and off for maybe 6 years, but tonight, after 7 months of not writing, I just felt this urgent need to put my feelings to pen and paper. Reading it back, its kind of scary (knowing myself) how dark it is, if that makes sense?  I don't really know why I'm posting it. Maybe someone out there will say 'SAME BITCH I FEEL THE SAME FUCKIN WAYYYYY'??? Who knows. Anyways, here goes:

March 4th, 2020

&amp;#x200B;

What does it mean when you feel so sad/lost/hopeless, but none of your friends or family seem to notice? To be constantly around people, but to feel so alone? To feel like you're being sucked into this black hole, but no one is around to help you out? To not really know how you feel? To wishing you were brave enough to tell other how you're feeling? To reach out for help? But at the same time, feeling hurt because nobody seems to care? To want someone to look into your eyes and see the sadness and tell you it's going to be okay? For the ones 'closest' to you to hear the lie in your laugh? To feel alone? Abandoned? Like you'll never be happy again? To be so scared that you'll feel this sad and lonely forever? Sometimes I really wonder if there is a single person out there that cares about my feelings, about my health, about my state of mind. I try so hard to be shoulder to cry on for my loved ones, to be a support system. But what about me? I've spent my whole life putting other people's needs before my own, and now that I'm trying SO HARD to focus on myself and put my needs first, I'm alone. Even the few people I've shared my feelings with are nowhere to be seen. What's the point in sharing if nobody cares? Because nobody cares, right? I think it's pretty obvious at this point. So what do you do when you have no support system?  No one in your corner to encourage you? To fight for you? To fight FOR you? When there's no one to tell you 'it's going to be okay'? To give you a hug while you cry? Because you're always crying. I don't know. I just want my smile to be real again.",04sabdi,6,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/fdpjop/emotional_hurricane/,first reddit post bear suicidal want anyone think dire need assistance want scare anyone depression 2 3 year wrote journal entry today kind illustrates constantly feel 24 7 journaling maybe 6 year tonight 7 month writing felt urgent need put feeling pen paper reading back kind scary knowing dark make sense really know posting maybe someone say bitch feel fuckin wayyyyy know anyways go march 4th 2020 amp x200b doe mean feel sad lost hopeless none friend family seem notice constantly around people feel alone feel like sucked black hole one around help really know feel wishing brave enough tell feeling reach help time feeling hurt nobody seems care want someone look eye see sadness tell going okay one closest hear lie laugh feel alone abandoned like never happy scared feel sad lonely forever sometimes really wonder single person care feeling health state mind try hard shoulder cry loved one support system spent whole life putting people need trying hard focus put need first alone even people shared feeling nowhere seen point sharing nobody care nobody care right think pretty obvious point support system one corner encourage fight fight one tell going okay give hug cry always cry know want smile real,emotional hurricane,04 abdi,2326,19,04 abdi first reddit post bear suicidal want anyone think dire need assistance want scare anyone depression 2 3 year wrote journal entry today kind illustrates constantly feel 24 7 journaling maybe 6 year tonight 7 month writing felt urgent need put feeling pen paper reading back kind scary knowing dark make sense really know posting maybe someone say bitch feel fuckin wayyyyy know anyways go march 4th 2020 amp x200b doe mean feel sad lost hopeless none friend family seem notice constantly around people feel alone feel like sucked black hole one around help really know feel wishing brave enough tell feeling reach help time feeling hurt nobody seems care want someone look eye see sadness tell going okay one closest hear lie laugh feel alone abandoned like never happy scared feel sad lonely forever sometimes really wonder single person care feeling health state mind try hard shoulder cry loved one support system spent whole life putting people need trying hard focus put need first alone even people shared feeling nowhere seen point sharing nobody care nobody care right think pretty obvious point support system one corner encourage fight fight one tell going okay give hug cry always cry know want smile real emotional hurricane

I'm failing school and I cant explain to the teachers why I'm doing bad because they won't care,"I'm getting really bad grades in a class I used to be really good at.

But I'm just lazy right? It's so frustrating being seen as careless when I'm just trying to survive. But my teachers expect me to get over myself because everyone goes through hard times. I'm already seeing a school counsellor who's not helping in any way and it's in secret because my parents wont let me see a proper therapist. Yesterday when I got 2 essays back I got E on both of them and I just wanted to tear my hair out because I'm trying so hard to balance everything out but it's not good enough. Seriously, all I can think about is killing myself and it's good enough that I actually come into school when I dont want anyone to see me because I feel too ugly, and I try to socialise with people and not zone out in class for like 8 hours.

Venting.,"Hi. I have had a bit of a rough day and honestly it feels like my thoughts are actually killing me. So I really feel like I need to express my feelings right now.
So my thoughts are just gonna be thrown out there so without further ado....
I think I suck. At everything...my job, having friends, just...everything really. It honestly feels like I cannot just work like a human being.

Now don't get me wrong, i don't hate life. I have things I rather love about life such as my family and my job including the people I work with.

And everyone keeps telling me how ""nice"" and ""good"" I am at my job such as winning a rather ""employee of the month"" sorta thing but as strange as this seems....

I struggle to believe them. Now of course I'm not calling them liars I just find it to hard to believe. I know that sounds rather stupid but I honestly just can't help feel this way.

As I said I truly love my job and everyone there but that is honestly where most of my self esteem comes from so constantly thinking I'm horrible at it is obviously not a good cycle.

Now as for everything else apart from my job, well I will just break it down like this:
I'm at overweight, ugly, shy, embarssing and awkward guy that honestly anyone could cringe at talking to. And of course I'm trying to overcome some of these things like the overweight part but...I'm honestly losing hope at this point and it's giving thoughts of doing something silly to my self.

Sorry about this silly dump of self pity but I actually couldn't think of what else to do.

26 and feeling so burnt out,"Long story short.. I've been in and out of college, failing out two different times taking breaks from classes once or twice. I've had on and off addiction problems with alcohol during this time.. basically I've been trying to get a bachelor's degree for 7 years. The last 4 years of college has caused me soo much stress. My parents are wealthy and not to say they are at fault in any way for my failire but they have sort of enabled me financially  to keep trying to get a degree. Ive wasted probly around $100,000 dollars on failed/withdrawn classes. My sister deeply resents me for this. I have an insane amount of guilt for this too even though my parents say they would pay anything and help me in any way they can for me to graduate. 

So after all that, i made it to my final semester b4 graduation. Im only taking 2 classes but i might fail 1 of them and that would result in my 3rd and final academic dismissal, meaning i wount get a degree cause of a flunk in my final semester. I just dont understand why i cant just sit here and do my homework and actually care. My problem is i dont give a crap about anything unless i have an innate desire or interest in it. Like my motivation is just 0 in anything thats academic i dont understand why!

So after all this.. even if i do pass and graduate i feel like im so broken, endured so much stress by the age of 26 that i feel like just a vegetable now.  i cant fathom myself using my business degree to get a ""real job""  i dont know if ill ever be able to get over the idea that i spent over 250,000 dollars on a degree and i have no desiree to work a normal job because i feel like my brain is this empty void that only seeks pleasure and has no purpose or drive. On the surface, im a happy bubbly person. Im outgoing and very sociable. I feel deep down i really have alot of potential but im soooo lost and so easily overwhelmed by everything. I feel the slightest bit of resistance and i just shut down mentally and seek pleasure in the form of leisure activity or alcohol. 

Idk where im even going with this.. sorta just letting it all out i guess because i have nobody to talk too. If you read this far im sorry for all the grammatical errors i just typed it all out and didnt re read it once.

Trapped,"Over the last few years, I've gone through various cycles of depression, anxiety &amp; panic attacks. I've fallen into the trap of everything's fine again i'm alright, only to be hit by a oncoming train of depression 6 months later. I spend a lot of time in my room alone &amp; I rarely leave the house much and when I do leave I feel massively anxious &amp; I feel much worse when dealing with people. I get hit sporadicly with depression &amp; insomnia, which makes everything so much worse. Insomnia has a truely wonderful talent of nuking everything.

I feel like I have no future and certainly no future or a life where i'm happy or even content. I've spoken to friends and loved ones about jobs and I always get the wishy-washy response of ""you'll be fine"" or ""everything will work out fine"". I want to have purpose in life but I just feel so incredibly hollow &amp; low all the time &amp; all my interests and hobbies just fade away. I'm absolutely terrified of applying for jobs (i've had a few interviews that completely nuked my mental health for more than a year) in fear that it's going to destroy my mental health again (had very bad experiences in my last job) and it doesn't help when friends/family tell me I need to apply or jobs or that i'm lazy. I really don't know what it is i'm suppose to do? or what it is that people think I should be doing? 

My biggest concern is that I just feel like if this is something I have to cope with for the rest of my life, I just don't think I'm going to be able to cope and I really worry where that will lead and what bearing it'll have on the important decisions in life. I'm really struggling to help myself and get help. Even writing this post has been hard (this is my fifth attempt) &amp; composing my thoughts has been really difficult. 

Has anyone had similar problems? or been in a similar situation and overcome it? I really don't want this but I feel like i'm stuck with it unable to do anything about it.

When I'm alone is when I'm most at risk.,"When I'm at work, I talk, laugh, and hide behind my shield. When I'm with family, I'm a little more vulnerable, but I'm mostly still silent about the things that are working hard against me to bring me down. However, when I'm alone...that's when it hits me. When my kids aren't home and I'm left to my own devices, that's when I'm the most afraid. It's not that I don't think anyone would miss me, it's the fact that I don't honestly care if they would or wouldn't. I feel like if they knew the extreme pain and mental anguish I'm in from the events my life has drug me through, they would understand my want for release. The constant cheating of exes, the constant deception and pain from being tossed away over and over again. The uselessness I feel of getting out of bed because the same vicious cycle awaits me every single day of my life! I'm tired. I'm tired of giving myself to others, putting myself out there and making myself vulnerable, just to wash, rinse, and repeat a thousand times more. Is it time for me to go? Does it matter?

Furiously Tired of “Running at it like a Bull”,"People are unrelatable and hindering to me at this point. I feel as if every time someone approaches me, or walks into my space, I can predict what they are going to say to me. This annoys me further.

Ive been fired from the last 5 jobs, all for reasons of using marijuana to calm myself from my co workers, or outright having a verbal confrontation which results in me getting fired. I used to like being around people, but as i reach the age of 25 i feel like i’ve been struggling for an eternity.

Im truly tired of this fucking 9-5 society everyone seems to be able to spend 40 years in and come out accomplished. It seems no matter how many counsellors  i appoint myself with, or how many doctors appointments im making nobody is helping me and i feel im reaching my breaking point. I know i cant live without society, but this cant continue.

Ive tried steps to help myself, counselling, therapy, doctors appointments; all leads back to the same bullshit place im in now, stuck in society. 

Ive recently acquired my second dui, have a breathalyzer in my vehicle and spend most days sitting at home thinking about how much i hate interacting with people.

The women my age ive dated and been around dont want to hear any of this. Men arent supposed to complain or whine. Im supposed to shut up, apply for another job, and continue to “run at it like a bull”.

"Ex bf is suicidal, depressed, and mentally ""not there"".. how to help?","I broke up with my bf about a year and a half ago, after being together 4 years. Throughout our relationship he was often depressed, angry at everything, narcissistic, extremely anxious, would go through phases of not eating, etc. I tried helping as much as I could and encouraging he get help (which he did a few times, on and off seeing a therapist) but it never worked.

I had to cut off our relationship because it just became ""too much"". He would blame me for his carelessness, would get annoyed if I offered help in any way, and was just constantly negative. I just often didn't feel loved, and without ranting his mental health issues were stressful as I tried and tried to help him and it felt useless.

When we broke up I didn't feel the need to block him but did not want to be ""friends"" or really ever have any communication any more. Since we broke up, he has texted me here and there that he's suicidal, hates everyone, screams at himself, has no reason to live, etc. He told me that since I broke up with him he would kill himself, but i took that more so as manipulation. I would text him trying to help, offering advice, and so on, which was mentally draining because any time I'd try and help he'd continue texting things like ""I'm just gonna kill myself"". I have told him so many times he needs professional help and by doing so will improve his mental health. 

He's nearly 30 and has barely held a job because he ""hates all the managers"" wherever he works and continuously drops out of school to sit at home and be handed money by his mom and play PS4 all day. When I encourage finding a different job or so on he gets offended and tells me I'm a ""slave"" because I have a full time job.

I've since entered a new relationship with someone I love very much. When my ex randomly occasionally texts me (he texts me probably once every 10-15 days) saying he wants to kill himself I panic and reply and try to help. I told my current bf about helping my ex and he was understandably upset. I know I need to stop communication with my ex but I worry by telling him we need to stop talking he actually will kill himself. I have told a close friend this and they told me if he doesn't want to accept help or seek any help, and kills himself, at least I tried and there was nothing more I could do. 

The other day at work I checked my phone and had a ton of missed texts from him saying he was going to kill himself  &amp; that he has no reason to live anymore. All the texts made me panic terribly, I had to leave work because I started crying and ended up calling suicide prevention (they were beyond unhelpful) because I know he needs help. After 4 years of hearing him talk about being depressed, and never accepting help and then breaking up and still hearing it through text and STILL trying to get him to see a professional and get help I am honestly burned out and mentally drained. I don't know what else I can do at this point besides telling him, for the last time, he needs help and due to me being in a new relationship we need to stop talking and I wish him the best.",videostore01,4,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/fdn8t6/ex_bf_is_suicidal_depressed_and_mentally_not/,broke bf year half ago together 4 year throughout relationship wa often depressed angry everything narcissistic extremely anxious would go phase eating etc tried helping much could encouraging get help time seeing therapist never worked cut relationship became much would blame carelessness would get annoyed offered help way wa constantly negative often feel loved without ranting mental health issue stressful tried tried help felt useless broke feel need block want friend really ever communication since broke ha texted suicidal hate everyone scream ha reason live etc told since broke would kill took manipulation would text trying help offering advice wa mentally draining time try help continue texting thing like gonna kill told many time need professional help improve mental health nearly 30 ha barely held job hate manager wherever work continuously drop school sit home handed money mom play ps4 day encourage finding different job get offended tell slave full time job since entered new relationship someone love much ex randomly occasionally text text probably every 10 15 day saying want kill panic reply try help told current bf helping ex wa understandably upset know need stop communication ex worry telling need stop talking actually kill told close friend told want accept help seek help kill least tried wa nothing could day work checked phone ton missed text saying wa going kill amp ha reason live anymore text made panic terribly leave work started cry ended calling suicide prevention beyond unhelpful know need help 4 year hearing talk depressed never accepting help breaking still hearing text still trying get see professional get help honestly burned mentally drained know else point besides telling last time need help due new relationship need stop talking wish best,ex bf suicidal depressed mentally help,video store 01,3093,69,video store 01 broke bf year half ago together 4 year throughout relationship wa often depressed angry everything narcissistic extremely anxious would go phase eating etc tried helping much could encouraging get help time seeing therapist never worked cut relationship became much would blame carelessness would get annoyed offered help way wa constantly negative often feel loved without ranting mental health issue stressful tried tried help felt useless broke feel need block want friend really ever communication since broke ha texted suicidal hate everyone scream ha reason live etc told since broke would kill took manipulation would text trying help offering advice wa mentally draining time try help continue texting thing like gonna kill told many time need professional help improve mental health nearly 30 ha barely held job hate manager wherever work continuously drop school sit home handed money mom play ps4 day encourage finding different job get offended tell slave full time job since entered new relationship someone love much ex randomly occasionally text text probably every 10 15 day saying want kill panic reply try help told current bf helping ex wa understandably upset know need stop communication ex worry telling need stop talking actually kill told close friend told want accept help seek help kill least tried wa nothing could day work checked phone ton missed text saying wa going kill amp ha reason live anymore text made panic terribly leave work started cry ended calling suicide prevention beyond unhelpful know need help 4 year hearing talk depressed never accepting help breaking still hearing text still trying get see professional get help honestly burned mentally drained know else point besides telling last time need help due new relationship need stop talking wish best ex bf suicidal depressed mentally help

Ready for the end at this point,Yea. I’m ready for the “you’re just a kid”. Idgaf. I want to go. My mind and body is screaming for a way out of this fucking horrible mindset of myn. Im a dumbfucking stoner with a stepdad who literally makes me fear to go downstairs. I sit in my room all day and hope that I just fucking die. My mom Dosent fucking care jack shit about me. My step dad gets pissed off over nothing. And leaves for 8 months. And I swear by this saying those 8 months are the happiest months I ever have. My stepfather almost choked his father out when he was 16 and said he wishes he did it. Which makes me scared to say anything to him. My mother knows I don’t like him and don’t like being near him but she Dosent care.

Am i depressed?,"*Posting on behalf of friend*

Basically I'm perpetually sad, but for no apparent reason (I work a lot at 17, but that seems normal)

I think suicide is a valid option, as I would be at peace, but I do not want to commit suicide due to friends and family feeling bad.

I also feel lonely, even around friends and family which leads to me think this is depression.

Is this depression, or is this just a phase?

"I am young, that doesn’t mean I don’t have depression","I don’t wanna specify my age, but I’m young. Because of this my mom thinks that I’m faking and won’t accept it.

Even when I tell my school counselor that I just don’t want to be alive anymore and they send police to my house to check up on me, my mom won’t believe me. Even when I tell her to at least get a doctor to diagnose me, she won’t, 

As previously mentioned, the place came to my house and they suggested that I might want to get a therapist. My mom said ok yeah sure whatever. A week later and I remind her. She says yeah I’m on it, another week goes by and my mom tells me that she just doesn’t want to pay for something that I’m probably faking for attention.

I guess I just feel overlooked,"Like the title says, I often times feel like I'm just a side character in the lives of those around me (19 M in college). It sucks. I was diagnosed with MDD about 2 months ago after struggling to convince myself I needed help for about 2 years, and it just kind of feels like despite trying to be more present in the lives of those around me I end up hurt and ignored no matter what I try. For example, I have tried to get into the habit of asking my roommates what they've been up to recently, how their day is going, if they want to get food, etc., and it just kinda feels like they don't have the time or motivation to reciprocate. When I try and share something from my life, I just feel like they shrug me off or ignore me completely. Every day feels like I am growing apart from those around me and needless to say it's not fun. I am introverted by nature, so socializing can often be exhausting, so I guess it's just even more insulting when those around me blow me off despite the colossal effort it can take to even say hello.",brednen_,6,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/fdl7x4/i_guess_i_just_feel_overlooked/,like title say often time feel like side character life around 19 college suck wa diagnosed mdd 2 month ago struggling convince needed help 2 year kind feel like despite trying present life around end hurt ignored matter try example tried get habit asking roommate recently day going want get food etc kinda feel like time motivation reciprocate try share something life feel like shrug ignore completely every day feel like growing apart around needle say fun introverted nature socializing often exhausting guess even insulting around blow despite colossal effort take even say hello,guess feel overlooked,bred nen,1035,30,bred nen like title say often time feel like side character life around 19 college suck wa diagnosed mdd 2 month ago struggling convince needed help 2 year kind feel like despite trying present life around end hurt ignored matter try example tried get habit asking roommate recently day going want get food etc kinda feel like time motivation reciprocate try share something life feel like shrug ignore completely every day feel like growing apart around needle say fun introverted nature socializing often exhausting guess even insulting around blow despite colossal effort take even say hello guess feel overlooked

I've ruined my whole damn life before it's even started,"Pretty sure this will get buried in all the other posts but I guess I need somewhere to vent... either that or i just want to remind myself what a piece of shit i am. 

I've been depressed pretty much my entire life, i never realised it, i thought everyone was sad all the time and had a constant pit in their stomach like they wanted to cry and had random thoughts about killing themselves. 
I've been going through this shit since elementary school. 
I've always been the akward kid that was overly loud and made jokes at my own expense in order to get others to crack a smile. 
I've never been good at keeping friendships let alone making friendships. Ive always considered myself a loner in a way, mainly because I always feel like I want to be alone. 

I've never been to a party unless it was for a birthday, never gone drinking with friends, never really had a conversation with anyone without it turning into an akward silence after a while. 
I'm currently a senior in highschool and I feel like I've wasted my highschool years. 

My freshman year I met this girl, she was great, caring, shy, cute, and seemed to truly listen to what i said. 
I never had the balls to ask her out which I suppose was a good thing because later on I found out that she was gay. 

After half a year, she got more and more involved with the highschool lgbt community which was full of just flat out rude people. 
This changed her... for the worse. She started spending alot less time with me, and before I knew it we had gone an entire month without spending any time together. I'd always ask her if she wanted to hang out but she was always ""busy"". 

She slowly started to do a complete 180 from who she used to be. She was becoming very self centered and was always saying how nice of a person she is. 
I eventually stopped talking to her completely because I realised she was destroying me. I was in love with who she used to be and I guess I thought that the harder I tried to be her friend, maybe shed start to like being around me again, i guess i was wrong. 
At one point i stopped even acknowledging her like she did to me and i guess this annoyed her because she would text me and ask me why i was doing it. 
I'd send a lengthy text explaining why and it's like she didnt even read it because she kept doing the exact same things that i told her were making me feel like trash below her. 

This friendship absolutely destroyed me and i became extremely depressed. I became somewhat of a hermit that would go to school and as soon as I got home would sleep until the next day. 
I still am really sad about what happened and I cant help but blame myself for not doing something or saying something earlier about how her friends were making her treat others. 

Well, basically, this kind of destroyed me self esteem and any confidence I had left. I was now the quiet kid at school, although my friend says that i dont really seem like the quiet type, I'm 6 foot 2 inches tall and am built like a ""viking"" as he says. 
I havent spent time with him in months because I can barely bring myself to leave my house. 
He is pretty much my last friend and i feel like I'm letting him slip away like i have with all my other friends and its destroying me but I'm too afraid to do anything about it. I hate myself, I'm a terrible friend and I dont know how to change it. 

I've always been known as the ""nice guy"" who helps in any way I can and likes to talk to anyone who is willing to give me the time of day. Now.... well I dont even know. 
There was a lady at the store the other day who dropped something, she had a cane and her arms full and I just fucking watched her struggle to pick her stuff up off the ground. What kind of fucking person just watches someone struggle??? Apparently I do... I just like, froze I guess, I couldn't move my body, it was like I was paralyzed and I had a pit in my stomach and I felt just really anxious if that's how youd describe it. 
I hate who I've become, I just want to go back to being the kind guy who always helps others instead of watching them struggle like a jackass. 

I dont know how to fix who I have become and I'm afraid it's going to affect me when I try and get a job this summer and when I go to college, I'm afraid I'm going to be this shell of who i used to be, someone who just watches things happen instead of giving a helping hand. I feel like agoddamn failure, mainly because I am. 

I guess this story type thing doesnt really have any point, just me talking to myself reflecting on how much of an asshole I am. If someone actually reads this, well, then I'd love any suggestions on how i can get rid of this damn shell. 

I left alot of details out, but it's 1am and I have school in the morning so maybe I'll come back sometime on my computer and fill in a bit more. 
Thanks for reading this if you did, I sincerely hope you dont have to go through what I've gone through.",yeeters-apprentice,22,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/fdawr6/ive_ruined_my_whole_damn_life_before_its_even/,pretty sure get buried post guess need somewhere vent either want

Diary Entry 01 - I hate Xi Jin Ping,"Dear Diary,

I feel myself, yet again, sliding into the abyss of darkness.

Is it better that I remain fueled by anger and frustration at the CCP? When hopelessness overtakes anger, I feel sucked into a swirling vortex of desolation.

Knives, scissors, any shiny sharp object - they all beckon warmly, seducing me with sweet promises of an end to this pain.

Carefully laid plans, budgets, all gone awry because of a situation beyond control. Exacerbated by one man's greed for power and face.

I fear to run out of anger. When fury no longer triggers, and desolation lays waste to sanity, it would probably be the beginning of the end.

I hate how I talk to a therapist every two weeks and I’m not diagnosed with depression. I cry every night and feel so alone. I’ve isolated myself from others in order to heal. I go to the gym 4 days a week, I eat healthy, I try to do some chores and self care too. I don’t know if I need meds because apparently I show signs of willingness so I don’t need them. I’m pissed that I am consumed by chronic sadness every day and night, 24/7. I’m also pissed that I have no supportive people besides my parents and cousin. Perhaps I’m ungrateful. I’d rather end it all tbh. Nothing in this life is exciting and at 21, life should be fun, exciting, wild, laid-back, etc. As a young woman, I should be excited for what’s to come. I should be excited for having a wonderful life but I am not. I absolutely hate my self and my life. Nothing is helping, not even talking to others.

Another long frustrated rant,"So I've been seeing a therapist for a couple of months now, and besides all the other upsides of therapy, I think my favorite and also most frustrating part is that my therapist confirmed that I am incredibly self-aware. 

To the point that she usually just agrees with me and I spend a lot of my sessions just talking to myself. Because I already know why my thoughts are irrational. I know I shouldn't let these things bother me. I know I'm not alone. I know this is an ongoing thing, I know, I know I know. 

And that's so frustrating. Because knowing doesnt make me feel any better. Knowing I need to learn how to like myself better and be okay to be alone  doesnt help me actually get there. And when I get there, or think I've gotten there, I dont really feel any better. 

Yes, I'm lonely. I should learn to enjoy my own company and spend time with people who actually want to be with me. Great! Done that! Do this all the fucking time. But I feel the same. I'm still lonely. I still hate myself. 

Worst part is that I cant even blame anyone or anything. I did this. I'm doing this. I'm the problem. 

My therapist part of the problem is that I overthink and keep having these expectations for myself. That I should try to just ""do"" what feels right. But I already do that. If anything, I do it too much. That's why I'm starting to accumulate so much junk in my house.

I genuinely feel good after being depressed for over one year straight,"Hey! The past year I've been really depressed. I tried to kill myself and felt like it wasn't getting better at all. I somehow managed to deal with everyday life, but I didn't really live. I knew what kind of behavior was appropriate and I tried acting accordingly, but I didn't feel what I was doing. The destination of my thoughts was always suicide. I thought about it a lot. I planned multiple suicide attempts. I wrote  farewell letters. Stuff like that. 
Now I slowly return to my true self. It's like I'm able to see the world in colour again. It's not that I'm always happy. There are days I feel bad. Even days I'm depressed again. But it's way better than it used to be. I'm in touch with my feelings again. I've almost forgotten how sensitive I was. I feel alive again and that's fucking amazing!

The reason I post this here is that I wanna remind you (and maybe even myself) that it gets better. You got this. You're strong. I believe in you. No matter how bad you feel at the moment, remember there will be times you feel better and that are worth living for!

Help me name a feeling,"First of all, some details about me. I am 25 years old male in my last semester of college (yaaay!) and I call myself protypal geek - introverted IT guy who loves fantasy and Sci-fi. I am from a small European country. 

I am struggling with a feeling I can't quite name. Most of the time I feel incomplete, like some vital piece of me is missing. This feeling goes away and the world turns brighter the minute I start feeling attracted to someone. Just the possibility of having a girlfriend makes me happy, that feeling of hope. And the minute I lose that hope.. well.. hello darkness my old friend.

I've read the usual advice ""you need to be complete by yourself, find a new hobby or something that makes you happy"". I've tried, really tried. It's possible to silence it, but not remove it. When I focus on work, or on a game, a book, anything I need to put my mind on, it goes away. Unless I have a really bad day, then I need to drill through it if I want to get something done.

It kinda sounds like depression triggered by loneliness, is something like that even possible? It also have pretty firm grasp on my life, on my actions to be precise. I am driven to look for at least that hope. I am currently trying to expand my social circle. I found out that there is a pretty big fantasy/LARP community in our country. Problem is that I am going in with finding a girlfriend as my main goal. Yeah I will probably have lots of fun, but that's secondary. Rationally it sounds pretty bonkers.

One last thing I should probably mention is that I had girlfriends in the past, but with big pauses between them. The shortest pause was half a year but a standard pause is around two years which is also for how long I am alone now. One of my theories is that all this is happening because I am operating in scarcity mindset. 

I am looking for someone who can relate, maybe even help me put a name on it.

medication just makes my dissociation worse,"I’ve always had issues with dissociation, but since I started taking meds for my depression it just seems to be a constant thing. I hate it, I feel like I’m not even human anymore. I feel more like a robot. Everybody says they’ve seen such a difference in me since I started taking them, but I’m not feeling better. I’m not feeling anything. Which is scarier than feeling depressed, because it was the emptiness that drove me to start self harming years ago and I desperately do not want to go back to that place. I feel like medication is pushing me backwards. I know it. can take many attempts to find the right medication, but I’ve tried three different ones so far and every one is the same.

Im very close to giving up.,"I [m23] am probably one or two bad days away from just giving up.
Im in school, taking classes to qualify for my dream program which would qualify me for my dream job. I have a girlfriend. I have a great family. But I'm not sure i have it in me do put up with the school and the problems with my relationship and dealing with my own mental health issues anymore.
Im struggling with depression and anxiety and ADHD symptoms, but the therapist that was supposed to refer me to a doctor to see about medicine hasnt done that yet. Its been almost two weeks and he hasnt returned calls or taken any steps at all to get me that medicine evaluation. I am not enough for my girlfriend. Not romantic enough. Not sexual enough. Not thoughtful enough. I have tried for years to change that, she's been through all of it, but i haven't changed a bit. Maybe the medication would help, but i cant seem to be able to get it.
I struggle to learn in class, i struggle to improve in my relationship, and every day i find it more enticing to just fall back on my bachelors degree that i already have and work in an office or something. Sure, i know i wont be happy. But im not happy now, so whats the difference? At least i wouldnt have to put any more effort in than i have to.

Low,"My head feels crazy like super foggy and slowed down but also spinning at 100mph because im thinking about so much and stressed but also feel nothing and low and its very confusing so im trying to list 
Why am i feeling low starting from immediate problems to longer lasting /more distant problems:


-struggling to write essay

-4 separate deadlines looming, haven't even started reading for 3 of them

-everyone is better than me

-i do not feel like i deserve to be at the uni i am at because i do not feel clever enough or that i fit in and feel like no one cares about me

-my classmate/friend is 700x better than me at everything... She is genuinely good at everything and she loves to ""unknowingly"" rub it in my face and make dehumanising comments if i ever even allude to struggling with anything by the slightest amount... Like if i ever even start to ask her for help or talk about how i dont understand a lecture before i even get a sentence out she cuts me off with ""what? Noooooooo dont be so sILLY, thats obvious!"" or goes on about how easy she finds it or how ""i dont need to go to revision because i know everything and [talking about exam we did earlier in the term which she hasn't looked at her grades for yet] i would know if i got anything wrong and i know i didnt because i know what i was doing"" blah blah blah ok I get it u know everything and are god sent

-If i even suggest i might not be all that ok upstairs she tells me im fine and that i dont need to worry and literally just shuts me down and then  immediately complains when i dont talk to her when we walk to lectures together

-my friend is fucking the most self absorbed person you know and she doesnt even realise and to make it worse we are from polar opposite social classes (i.e she is rich, privately educated, lived extremely sheltered and ungrateful life where ahe gets whatever she wants whenever) so she always makes comments about things like if i mention student debt she LITERALLY went ""well your parents pay for university so dont worry""... And i had to go ""no they cannot afford to do that"" and then proceed to tell her, yes, i have had a job since i was 14 and no it wasnt because i wanted experience it was so i could afford the luxury of university and then explain what a bursary was and she kept making ignorant remarks like ""wha- why would you need that"" ""it doesn't cost thAT much"" and just... She is quite dehumanising and makes me feel like utter worthless shit. Its annoying because she doesnt realise how lucky she is and how lucky she is to of had to many opportunities handed to her and all the connections she has to good companies and high paying jobs just because of who her parents are... Like... All im saying is i wish she would stop being so blind to the world and actually learn that there are other people that exist that haven't lived the same life as her and i wish she would be respectful to people and not so fucking oblivious to the world!

-i miss home

-i am burnt out and need a break but i do not and will not ever get one because as soon as term is over, i need to revise. Then term starts and i learn. Then term ends and i revise and study and work and revise. No break ever.

-anxiety through the roof about everything

-i miss home

-other stuff like memories about things i forgot ever happened but i cant remember all the details or i remember everything over and over again and im not sure why they make me feel so horrible or nervous because theyre not necessarily bad events im just thinking about memories or events from when I was younger or not even from that long ago but i wish i wouldnt remember anything because it seems to be bothering me

-comparing myself to my sister, my sister being better than me, im expected to do really really well at uni ""for your sister"" (according to my mother since my sister is taking a year out of uni)... So MY degree isnt about me anymore its about doing it for my fucking sister who has basically stolen everything from me and now since she i taking a year out all the attention is on her, which is fine but now eveyone assumes she is the only one allowed to suffer and i am doing fantastic because i haven't dropped out or taken a year out or anything so apparently that means im fucking fantastic and going to get a 1st in my exams (""for"" my sister... Because i dont matter)... And i also cant go to my parents, not that i ever would have before, because all attention is on my sister and i am not allowed to let them down i have to do well for my sister

What bothers me is the soul crushing loneliness, I havent had a girlfriend in years and I haven't been physically touched in what seems like forever.

I'm so tired of all the bitterness...,"I had a bad childhood growing up. My parents were addicts and all they cared about was their addiction, so I grew up pretty much being raised and cared for by my brother and my grandmother. I've suffered through child abuse, sexual assault, and a hefty handful of mental illness throughout my life, and I'm just so tired of negativity. I struggled throughout my childhood with the hope that things would be better when I became an adult and got away from that lifestyle, but it's not. It feels like the whole damn world is just as hateful and cruel and nasty as my childhood was. How do you wake up in the morning and continue to go on when you haven't a hope in the world things are ever going to ""get better""? How do you wake up and brave the bullsh** of life when everywhere you look you see nothing but hate? Whenever I try to talk about it, I'm greeted with ""that's life"" or ""welcome to adulthood"" and I'm tired of it already. I'm tired of ""tough love"". I just can't wrap my mind around how so many people can be so hateful towards each other. People killing each other left and right, hating each other for the color of their skin, for the way they dress, the people they love, and the higher powers they choose to believe in. I just don't understand it all. My heart aches. I feel like a sad, lonely little girl who started running through a dark tunnel towards the light only to be greeted with a punch to the gut and a spit in the face when coming out the other end. I'll wake up every morning and live my life still, I'll go to work and do my job, make my money and pay my bills, but the light died in me a long time ago.

I Still Struggle Admitting I Need Help,"This is kinda a vent; I need to look myself in the mirror for a few minutes and try to restart my downward cycle. If you want to have a conversation, I’m here for it, otherwise nothing to see here haha.

I’ve been so low the past couple weeks I haven’t felt like myself at all. I’ve felt a fair amount of that apathy I read about on this sub often, and it’s scary.

I know the things I need to do in order to overcome this depression - the tools I can reach for. Exercise, nutrition, therapy, group therapy, being open with friends and family, volunteering, strong social connections, medical health, and on and on. The laundry list is long and tough to grapple with all at once. But having a couple of weeks of pure hell makes me realize that I’m really not working on any one of those things strongly. 

What have I done to really move forward in the last year? I feel like I haven’t really reached for any of those huge steps since I started therapy in 2015. I’ve been going for over four years, and it’s been life-changing, but what other healthy steps have I taken? 

Last summer my dental health became overwhelming, something I must take care of. I went back for my first appointment in years. Gradually I took care of my pain and the rot in my mouth was alleviated. I lost a tooth in the process but a huge weight was lifted as well. 

I need some similar weight lifted now, but most of all I want to be able to reach for it. I crave some discipline; the dental work came as a result of time running out as it were, reactive not proactive. I want to be strong enough to work thru this shit at a healthy pace, not leave things go awry for months on end, until a consequence happens. But I suppose in order to get there I have to first admit that I AM weak and I DO need help. I can’t do it all on my own like I tell myself I must. 

I’d really like to get an exercise bike. I can see all the positives: cardio health/body positivity/motivation to hike more/overall getting in shape. For someone healthy, buying a bike (putting in the research, going to stores, asking people for advice) would be doable. Simple tasks like that are fucking hard for me because I’m not healthy.

So how do I get there? Ask my sister to take me shopping one day? This post is a good start: question why I’ve failed in the past and talk through the doable steps, remind myself of the positive outcomes in working thru it. Maybe I need to meditate again: breathe thru the pressure in my chest when I think about going to a bike store or talking to people on Craigslist. 

I wish I could work thru these things easily like a normal person. I guess my win today is admitting I’m broken and depression is at fault. Maybe if I admit that more often I’ll see it’s ok to ask for help and beat myself up less.

I’ve never really lost love for myself because I know I’m a good man. My therapist told me that purpose can be looked at as two halves: BEing and DOing. Right now I’m happy with my self-philosophy and who I am when I’m NOT depressed. That person is good. It’s time to accept that I’m not healthy enough to DO good yet. At least not to the degree that I hope my future holds. It’s hard to reconcile how much depression is holding me back. I hope I can look myself in the mirror this deeply in the next little while and reach for more of that help that I need to pick myself up off the ground. Maybe it can start with the exercise bike.",OutsideitCZ,0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/fdk76f/i_still_struggle_admitting_i_need_help/,kinda vent need look mirror minute try restart downward cycle want conversation otherwise nothing see haha low past couple week felt like felt fair amount apathy read sub often scary know thing need order overcome depression tool reach exercise nutrition therapy group therapy open friend family volunteering strong social connection medical health laundry list long tough grapple couple week pure hell make realize really working one thing strongly done really move forward last year feel like really reached huge step since started therapy 2015 going four year life changing healthy step taken last summer dental health became overwhelming something must take care went back first appointment year gradually took care pain rot mouth wa alleviated lost tooth process huge weight wa lifted well need similar weight lifted want able reach crave discipline dental work came result time running reactive proactive want strong enough work thru shit healthy pace leave thing go awry month end consequence happens suppose order get first admit weak need help like tell must really like get exercise bike see positive cardio health body positivity motivation hike overall getting shape someone healthy buying bike putting research going store asking people advice would doable simple task like fucking hard healthy get ask sister take shopping one day post good start question failed past talk doable step remind positive outcome working thru maybe need meditate breathe thru pressure chest think going bike store talking people craigslist wish could work thru thing easily like normal person guess win today admitting broken depression fault maybe admit often see ok ask help beat le never really lost love know good man therapist told purpose looked two half right happy self philosophy depressed person good time accept healthy enough good yet least degree hope future hold hard reconcile much depression holding back hope look mirror deeply next little reach help need pick ground maybe start exercise bike,still struggle admitting need help,outside itcz,3423,38,outside itcz kinda vent need look mirror minute try restart downward cycle want conversation otherwise nothing see haha low past couple week felt like felt fair amount apathy read sub often scary know thing need order overcome depression tool reach exercise nutrition therapy group therapy open friend family volunteering strong social connection medical health laundry list long tough grapple couple week pure hell make realize really working one thing strongly done really move forward last year feel like really reached huge step since started therapy 2015 going four year life changing healthy step taken last summer dental health became overwhelming something must take care went back first appointment year gradually took care pain rot mouth wa alleviated lost tooth process huge weight wa lifted well need similar weight lifted want able reach crave discipline dental work came result time running reactive proactive want strong enough work thru shit healthy pace leave thing go awry month end consequence happens suppose order get first admit weak need help like tell must really like get exercise bike see positive cardio health body positivity motivation hike overall getting shape someone healthy buying bike putting research going store asking people advice would doable simple task like fucking hard healthy get ask sister take shopping one day post good start question failed past talk doable step remind positive outcome working thru maybe need meditate breathe thru pressure chest think going bike store talking people craigslist wish could work thru thing easily like normal person guess win today admitting broken depression fault maybe admit often see ok ask help beat le never really lost love know good man therapist told purpose looked two half right happy self philosophy depressed person good time accept healthy enough good yet least degree hope future hold hard reconcile much depression holding back hope look mirror deeply next little reach help need pick ground maybe start exercise bike still struggle admitting need help

"This is all too much for me today, I want to disappear for a while","I've struggled with major depressive disorder for years now, I was officially diagnosed in 2016 but I know I had it for about 5 years before that at least. I've had a suicide attempt (right before officially being diagnosed) and since have had ups and downs... the downs happen about every other year.

Tonight I'm sitting at work, wanting to run away, cry, and hide. I've been doing fairly good lately but I just received life changing news a few nights ago, and I am not ready for this change.

I told my SO exactly how I feel and what I want (well maybe I should say don't want), which was relieving and helped me feel better for a few minutes but now I'm back to stressed out and wanting to cry. I'm worried he secretly hates that I don't want the change. Will he break up with me even though we are engaged and haven't had any issues? I hope not.. he always tells me he wants me to be honest with him and not keep things from him, so I'm trying to be open/honest but I know he doesn't enjoy hearing my honest opinions and feelings at times.

How can you bring a child into the world though when both parents would be in debt, one is jobless, we aren't even married yet, I struggle with my mental health/anxiety regarding everything about having a kid even all the crap before they are born, and one parent is a registered sex offender still on probation???

I can't do this. I was hopeful for the first couple of days... but then i started considering more about our situation and how we are NOT ready. I haven't tols many people at all, but I told him today if I can't abort it then I want to seriously give it up for adoption. I just can't. 

Call me irresponsible for not being more careful. I try to have the mentality of ""everything happens for a reason"" but I can feel myself falling apart mentally. Work helps distract me to a degree but there is a lot of downtime tonight and I keep ruminating and feeling down. I'm also pretty sure I'm too far along to get an abortion and it isn't like we can afford it anyway. FML :( :( :(

Can't seem to catch a break,"Just as my month long problem was slowly coming to an end and thing's were looking somewhat up for me more stress and worry has been thrown at me.   


After a month of stressing over getting back into my main group of friends who decided some separation would benefit everyone I learn that I was likely not going to be welcomed back...least not by the few members who genuinely didn't like me. My closest friend had a heart to heart with me about it and even though it still hurts losing the only place I felt I could relax and enjoy myself I was starting to let it go now that I knew I didn't have to worry about coming back. Still have some hangups about it all but again it was all getting better.  


Then I dont here from my Girlfriend for 3 days, finally getting a message from her the day after my birthday with her saying she's dealing with stuff and that none of its my fault and that I didnt do anything. She wont talk to me about it whatever it is and I know its bad cause she isn't acting like herself. Part of me is afraid it has to do with me but isn't my fault. I talked with a close friend and I was able to regain some of my reasoning to eventually tell her that until she wants to talk with me I'll leave her be and give her space to think. But it's still a bit disheartening that she doesn't say I love you back...its been 2 insistence and the second time she just said ""You Too"" so maybe she's just distracted by her thoughts and forgot.   


This year has been the saddest year of all for me, I wont say depressing cause I haven't been diagnosed, and I'm just hoping these feelings go away cause I'm not myself and that annoys me to no end.

An ode to grief,"I just made a journal entry and I thought I could share it to see if it helps anyone going through grief stages. 

There’s something that happens to a person when a piece of your soul passes away. You realize that you’re in denial all this time. That something you never thought you would want becomes something you realized you pushed away into the ignorant side of your mind so you wouldn’t think about it. So yes, a part of my soul is gone. And I’ve been trying to numb that pain that is beyond any kind of description. I feel like I had something precious that was ripped out of my hands and lit on fire to burn. Something that was alive and part of me burned and I could feel that slow, painful burn. Like watching someone you love get tortured by some unknown entity. This results in the stages of grief.... there’s denial. Which I already had since I was a child. I grew up in ignorant bliss. Not wanting to acknowledge what I knew was true. 
The there was anger. This nasty creature that you create to get back at whatever hurt you. And it will literally drive you mad. Crazy, trying to show others how much someone hurt you. Trying to find something called “closure” ( which by the way is the only fairytale or myth that you will ever hear. Closure is the only thing in the world that is impossible). Now you’re stuck in this miserable monster. You wonder how you’ll escape alive and some never do. I’m sorry for the ones who were the center of my anger and unclearity. You did not deserve what I gave you from my period of grief.
Then you bargain. For the sake of whatever sanity you may have left. You bargain for hope, freedom, and whatever else that you have. It’s not a lot. But regardless you bargain just the same. You try to find people who will help and love you unconditionally. Then you realize that they can’t enable the grief anymore than you can. You’re left alone again. Wondering who the hell you have become because it just isn’t you anymore. You’ve become this sad and hopeless mess of a person. The people you love love you so much they can’t take your struggling any more that you can. That’s when your soul dies a little more.
Then there is depression. That’s there through y’all of the stages. That feeling of NO motivation. No life. It’s an empty void but filled with all the feeling mentioned prior. Depression makes you remember your not the only one. You are made of many sad and hurting people who just want some sort of clarity. They just question every day “ why? What can I do? Why am I feeling these things.” This makes you wonder if your feelings are even ok to feel. 
Supposedly, there is acceptance.... I have not gotten there yet. Most with depression haven’t. Good luck to all of us. This is that bridge that we have not crossed and some (myself) are very afraid to cross it. It means that we will be ok. And sometimes that’s really scary because we don’t always know how to feel ok anymore. We have the beautiful loved ones that have been there no matter what. They want our success and happiness. A deep part of our soul wants that too.... the part that is still alive. We forget that part don’t we? My beautiful friends. There is a soul in our bodies. One that has not been ripped away. One that cannot be taken from an ugly thing such as grief. Every day that we are here. Together. Let’s reach out to the part of our soul that has survived. And let us remember that we are more than our grief and suffering.

First session with new counsellor and it was... weird,"Ok so while this is definitely not my first time going to counseling, this was the first meeting with a new counsellor. It was set up through my work's EAP service, which I've used before with limited success. 

Anyway, I had my first session this week and it was weird. First of all, it was in a very unconventional location. It was in an office (I mean literally a room with a desk and some office chairs), inside an organization not typically known for mental health services. So that was weird and it took me a while to get comfortable enough to start talking. 

Since this was the first session, most of it was just me explaining what was going on in my life and why I'm there. Anyway, near the end she remarked that I was a fascinating person and she really wants to talk to me more. That's my first time hearing that, especially from a professional. Then she asked me if I was familiar with the mbti, to which I replied I am not a fan. She also suggested I check out metaphysics because it might help me or something. 

I Dunno , I walked out of there feeling strange. On one hand, the counselor was nice and all, but on the other hand, certain things made me a bit uncomfortable. 

Anybody else have any similar experiences?

how do you regain self-worth,"throwaway:)

As the title says, I am a very insecure person. I have grown up with parents who gave little affection to me and a narcissistic father who has crushed any self worth I have. Throughout middle and high school, I was popular but at the same time, I was never anyone's favorite person. I thought it was because I never had freedom or a phone during those times. I managed to escape and go to school away from my parents in college, but if anything, I have become even worse. I am so desperately afraid of losing the friends that I have made, in particular, someone who is the FIRST person in my life to have feelings for me. He knows me like the back of my hand, but now that we are doing long distance, it's naturally just harder and sometimes I come off as insecure when I ask him things. Most of the time, he is the only one I talk to about many things such as my parents which many don't understand. I just really don't want to lose him and he has said that he is tired of me being insecure, but I am naturally just not that special or pretty or smart and I can't help it. I wasn't like this when I met him, but I can't stop thinking about how he's going to find someone infinitely better when he starts his new job soon and never look at me again.

I am in college so I have little time for hobbies but I still read and work out in my free time. Most of the time I am studying, but I barely get by in school and can't land an internship for the summer.

Resigned from my paid internship today. I'm worried about the immediate future.,"I felt too overwhelmed balancing graduate-level schoolwork and a paid internship, and I felt like I wasn't getting as much done as I would have liked, wasting a lot of time. So I asked my advisor via email if I could end my contract early, for the research position I was given. 

He accepted the resignation, but I've been nervous bringing it up for weeks now. I was worried because I've been coming in late or on some days not at all. My depression is getting worse, and I feel like my antidepressant dosage is too low to be effective. I'm not sure which is a bigger black mark on my resume/needing a future recommendation for a job: not showing up to work because I'm having a depressive episode, or ending the internship to spare them from further episodes. 

It's the first time I've been employed as a STEM major, and I've completely messed it up. I only have rent money left and then, who knows. I feel so shitty and small, and mostly stupid. I can't possibly say that I've changed my mind now, it'll look too odd after all the rigamarole I went through trying to quit, emailing various advisors and internship coordinators. 

I'm so tired, and my boyfriend thinks that I've shot myself in the foot and yelled in disbelief. ""I don't know how to make it better,"" he said. 

I just don't know what to do.

I don't want to work hard,"I just don't. I feel so empty whenever I think about quitting playing videogames and smoking weed. I feel so, so burdened by having to learn things and develop skills. This is why I can't go back to school, because to be successful in school I'd have to start practicing a lot of new skills. I hate practicing skills. I hate practicing writing. I hate reading just for the sake of reading and self improvement. 

I don't care if I technically get better at stuff. It doesn't make me feel any better and it's actually a cause of suffering for me. Learning new things and going out of my way to practice skills is so un-enticing to me, that I legitimately believe my life has no hope and I'd rather be dead. There is no reward. No reward can give me back the time I lose to working diligently at something. And everything is so fucking boring. Knowing that I have to suck it up and literally CHOOSE to like things like hard work just make me want to go on a killing spree. It feels like a grave injustice. It's too late for me. I've played the videogames. I've smoked the weed. For years. I no longer reap ANY pleasure from hard work, from building connections, from sitting and reading, from studying; all this shit does is make me agitated and bored, but also hopeless, because there is no hope for me. There's no hope because I DO NOT WANT TO WORK. And I'm not talking about a fucking job. I'm talking about fucking EVERYTHING. I don't want to solve challenges in my life.

Here,"When my ego dies, will it take me with it?

It's a selfish creature. It needs to be the best. It needs to be important. It needs people to agree with it. It throws tantrums. It lashes out when it's made to feel small. It thrives when it elevates itself above others. It thrives when it acts as if I am its personal chariot. It beats me down, demanding more than I could ever give. It piles on while I lie on the floor. It lives in a fantasy world full of delusion and self importance. But I withstand. I persist. It's all I know. It hurts. I suffer at its hands. I'm blinded.

Same shit as everything else in this sub,"I have been having more and more chest pains while I have a heart condition. I’ve been to the ER for it before but at this point as much as I want to live I don’t think I’ll ever be happy living. The more I’ve been thinking more about the world and people the more I realize how little control we have. We are attracted to people because that’s who our environment and biology tells us to be attracted to, we do actions based on the same two things. As you can probably tell I’m a hard determinist. I don’t believe anyone is special, I don’t believe in love. Most days I have slivers of happiness but those slivers are over come with feelings of extreme loneliness. When I say slivers I mean a second or two followed by a dive into the abyss of sadness. Anyone I think I actually connect to leaves. I don’t blame them either. I’m talking to this women who tells me that kissing for her is not cheating. I tried to understand why I would feel bad if someone I was with kisses someone else, is it my insecurity, is it my fear they will leave (under the umbrella of insecurity, I realize) idk. She tells me each connection you have is special but I’m thinking if they’re all special, then, none of them are. And if this connection was so special why would the person sever it. I mean there might be a multitude of reasons but at the end of the day it becomes as if that “special” person doesn’t exist anymore. But, if y’all do manage to keep talking how does one person not feel the pain. I guess you both have to be in healthy relationships on your own (that could end at any moment) and have to not depend on a relationship. Isn’t our end goal to produce viable offspring though. So wouldn’t we be working, looking good, exercising all to make us an appealing mate. Is there any authenticity if you have no control over the people you bond with and they don’t either. Is their anyone special out there to face the cruel oblivion with or are we, more so am I, destined to feel alone for the rest of my life.

Life is tough,"I don't know if this belongs here and I apologize if it doesn't. This post is meant to be rhetorical. No additional details will be provided and no feedback is required. Just getting some thoughts out of my head in hopes my brain can find a little peace.

Recently I've been dealing with a lot of negativity. I'm in jeopardy of losing my family due to some actions I've taken/decisions I've made. My girlfriend and her two little boys have given my life purpose. Before they became my life I would spend more nights at the bar than not, simply because it was something to do. I didn't do this to pick up chicks or anything, it just was better than sitting at home. If I lose them I don't really know what I would do with my life.

There's a quote from Ernest Hemingway that goes ""Every man has two deaths, when he is buried in the ground and the last time someone says his name.""  I am by no means contemplating suicide or being buried. It got me thinking about completely severing ties with everyone I've ever known and starting life over somewhere else though. Essentially burying the life I've had so far.

How long would it take before my friends and family stop trying to find me? How long before I'm not a daily/weekly/monthly thought on their mind? How long before I'm a distant memory or not a memory at all. Could I even do it? I already go weeks without talking to my parents. Longer without talking to my family. Random amounts of time without talking to friends. There's few people I talk to daily and the only person I can say I talk to daily with 100% certainty is my girlfriend. 

I wonder if I could truly run away from it all and start a new life if the life I have now falls apart. Could I manage to find a new purpose that wouldn't be caught in the shadow of the purpose I feel now?",anon8372627383,0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/fdpmwh/life_is_tough/,know belongs apologize post meant rhetorical additional detail provided feedback required getting thought head hope brain find little peace recently dealing lot negativity jeopardy losing family due action taken decision made girlfriend two little boy given life purpose became life would spend night bar simply wa something pick chick anything wa better sitting home lose really know would life quote ernest hemingway go every man ha two death buried ground last time someone say name mean contemplating suicide buried got thinking completely severing tie everyone ever known starting life somewhere else though essentially burying life far long would take friend family stop trying find long daily weekly monthly thought mind long distant memory memory could even already go week without talking parent longer without talking family random amount time without talking friend people talk daily person say talk daily 100 certainty girlfriend wonder could truly run away start new life life fall apart could manage find new purpose caught shadow purpose feel,life tough,8372627383,1801,13,8372627383 know belongs apologize post meant rhetorical additional detail provided feedback required getting thought head hope brain find little peace recently dealing lot negativity jeopardy losing family due action taken decision made girlfriend two little boy given life purpose became life would spend night bar simply wa something pick chick anything wa better sitting home lose really know would life quote ernest hemingway go every man ha two death buried ground last time someone say name mean contemplating suicide buried got thinking completely severing tie everyone ever known starting life somewhere else though essentially burying life far long would take friend family stop trying find long daily weekly monthly thought mind long distant memory memory could even already go week without talking parent longer without talking family random amount time without talking friend people talk daily person say talk daily 100 certainty girlfriend wonder could truly run away start new life life fall apart could manage find new purpose caught shadow purpose feel life tough

Dating While Depressed?,"So to put the question into context so everyone can understand where I'm coming from. I've been dealing with depression and anxiety for years, really fucked up childhood but some better took me in when I was a preteen so that helped but I still feel everything. Now I've been to therapy a couple times and they helped but that was when my insurance covered it now it doesn't so I don't have a therapist. I'm debating on getting onto some meds and seeing a psychiatrist. Anyways point is can I date if I'm making steps to get better? I'm a 21 ginger virgin male with lots of insecurities and depression doesn't help. In fact I'm worried I have bi polar disorder because my symptoms fall into that category more so than MDD. My point is I constantly feel like any woman can and should do better than me. I have this crippling feeling every time I like a girl I think ""just stop, they can do better leave her alone"" literally ALL my friends are in relationships and I want it so bad. I want what they have but I have little to no experience, the one ego boost I have is I was once told I was the best kisser she's ever met and she been around the block a couple times. I'll be honest I miss her to, she was someone I would've been willing to lose the V to and risk the rejection because she was so nice and one of the most non judgmental people I've ever met and she was a nerd to lol. She moved States for school so our fun was cut short.  Should I try to date? It's really hard for me since I've never been in love and don't know what to look for. I also wanna get the virgin thing outta the way so I'm not one when I'm 40. Fuck society and it's social stigmas, they're impossible not to follow it seems. I just don't see how I can date if I'll have these feelings for a few more years and I don't want to be 30 year old man with no experience either.

"New wiki on how to avoid accidentally encouraging suicide, and how to spot covert incitement","We've been seeing a worrying increase in pro-suicide content showing up here and, and also going unreported. This undermines our purpose here, so we wanted to highlight and clarify our guidelines about both direct and indirect incitement of suicide.  

We've created a wiki that covers these issues.  We hope this will be helpful to anyone who's wondering whether something's okay here and which responses to report.  It explains in detail why *any* validation of suicidal intent, even an ""innocent"" message like ""if you're 100% committed, I'll just wish you peace"" is likely to increase people's pain, and why it's important to report even subtle pro-suicide comments. The full text of the wiki's current version is below, and it is maintained at [/r/SuicideWatch/wiki/incitement](http://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/wiki/incitement). 

We deeply appreciate everyone who gives responsive, empathetic, non-judgemental support to our OPs, and we particularly thank everyone who's already been reporting incitement in all forms.  

Please report any post or comment that encourages suicide (or that breaks any of the other guidelines in the sidebar) to the moderators, either by clicking the ""report"" button or by [sending us a modmail](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2FSuicideWatch) with a link. We deal with all guideline violations that are reported to us as soon as we can, but we can't read everything so community reports are essential. If you get a PM that breaks the guidelines, please report it both [to the reddit sitewide admins](http://www.reddit.com/report) and to us in modmail.

***[/r/SuicideWatch/wiki/incitement](http://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/wiki/incitement)***  
*******

###Summary###

**It's important to respect and understand people's experiences and emotions. It's never necessary, helpful, or kind to support suicidal intent. There are some common misconceptions (discussed below) about suicidal people and how to help them that can cause well-meaning people to inadvertently incite suicide. There are also people online who incite suicide on purpose, often while pretending to be sympathetic and helpful.** 

###Validate Feelings and Experiences, Not Self-Destructive Intentions###

We're here to offer support, not judgement.  That means accepting, with the best understanding we can offer, whatever emotions people express.  Suicidal people are suffering, and we're here to try to ease that by providing support and caring.  The most reliable way we know to de-escalate someone at risk is to give them the experience of feeling understood. That means not judging whether they should be feeling the way they are, or telling them what to do or not do.  

But there's an important line to draw here.  There's a crucial difference between empathizing with feelings and responding non-judgmentally to suicidal thoughts, and in any way endorsing, encouraging, or validating suicidal intentions or hopeless beliefs. 

Anything that condones suicide, even passively, *encourages* suicide. It isn't supportive and does not help. It also violates reddit's sitewide rules as well as our guidelines. Explicitly inciting suicide online is a criminal offense in most jurisdictions. 

Do not treat any OP's post as meaning that will definitely die by suicide and can't change their minds or be helped. Anyone who's able to read the comments here still has a chance to choose whether or not to try to keep living, even if they've also been experiencing intense thoughts of suicide, made a suicide plan, or started carrying it out.  

In [the most useful empirical model we have](https://www.apa.org/science/about/psa/2009/06/sci-brief), the desire to die by suicide primarily comes from two interpersonal factors; alienation and a sense of being a burden or having nothing to offer. These factors usually lead to a profound feeling of being unwelcome in the world. 

**So, any acceptance or reinforcement of suicidal intent, even something ""innocent"" like ""I hope you find peace"", is actually a form of covert shunning that validates a person's sense that they're unwelcome in the world. It will usually add to their pain even if kindly meant and gently worded.**  

###How to Avoid Validating Suicidal Intent###

Keep the following in mind when offering support to anyone at risk for suicide.  

* **People who say they don't want help usually can feel better if they get support that doesn't invalidate their emotions.** Unfortunately, [many popular ""good"" responses are actually counterproductive](https://www.speakingofsuicide.com/2015/03/03/what-not-to-say/). In particular, many friends and family tend to rely exclusively on trying to convince the suicidal person that ""it's not so bad"", and this is usually experienced as ""I don't understand what you're going through and I'm not going to try"".  People who've had ""help"" that made them feel worse don't want any more of the same.  It doesn't mean that someone who actually knows how to be supportive can't give them any comfort.   

*  **Most people who are suicidal want to end their** ***pain,*** **not their lives.**  It's almost never true that death is the only way to end these people's suffering. Of course there are exceptional situations, and we certainly acknowledge that, for some people, the right help can be difficult to find. But preventing someone's suicide doesn't mean prolonging their suffering if we do it by giving them real comfort and understanding. 

* ***An unfixable problem doesn't mean that a good life will never be possible***.  We don't have to fix or change anything to help someone feel better. It's important to keep in mind that the correlation between our outer circumstances and our inner experience is weaker and less direct than commonly assumed.  For every kind of difficult life situation, you will find some people who lapse into suicidal despair, and others who cope amazingly well, and a whole spectrum in between. A key difference is how much inner resilience the person has at the time. This can depend on many personal and situational factors. But when there's not enough, interpersonal support can both compensate for its absence and help rebuild it.  We go into more depth on the ""it gets better"" issue in [this PSA Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/25igd7/whats_wrong_with_it_gets_better_what_if_it_doesnt/) which is always linked from our sidebar (community info on mobile) guidelines. 

* **There are** ***always*** **more choices than brutally forcing someone to stay alive or passively letting them end their lives**.

To avoid accidentally breaking the anti-incitement rule, don't say or try to imply that acting on suicidal thoughts is a good idea, or that someone can't turn back or is already dead.  Do whatever you can to help them feel cared for and welcome, at least in this little corner of the world.  [Our talking tips](http://redd.it/igh87) offer more detailed guidance.

###Look Out for Deliberate Incitement.  It May Come in Disguise.###

Often comments that subtly encourage suicidal intent actually come from suicide fetishists and voyeurs ([unfortunately this is a real and disturbing phenomenon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Francis_Melchert-Dinkel)). People like this *are* out there and the anonymous nature of reddit makes us particularly attractive to them.  

They will typically try to scratch their psychological ""itch"" by saying things that push people closer to the edge.  They often do this by exploiting the myths that we debunked in the bullet points above.  Specifically you might see people doing the following:

* Encouraging the false belief that the only way suicidal people can end their pain is by dying.  **There are** ***always*** **more and better choices than ""brutally forcing someone to stay alive"" or helping (actively or passively) them to end their lives**.

* Creating an artificial and toxic sense of ""solidarity"" by linking their encouragement of suicide to empathy.  They will represent themselves as the only one who really understand the suicidal person, while either directly or indirectly encouraging their self-loathing emotions and self-destructive impulses.  **Since most people in suicidal crisis are in desperate need to empathy and understanding, this is a particularly dangerous form of manipulation.**  

Many suicide inciters are adept at putting a benevolent spin on their activities while actually luring people away from sources of real help.  A couple of key points to keep in mind: 

* **Skilled suicide intervention -- peer or professional -- is based on empathic responsiveness to the person's feelings that reduces their suffering in the moment.**  Contrary to pop-culture myths, it does **not** involve persuasion (""Don't do it!""), cheerleading (""You've got this!"") or meaningless false promises (""Trust me, it gets better!""), or invalidation (""Let me show you how things aren't as bad as you think!"").  Anyone who leads others to expect these kinds of toxic responses, or any other response that prolongs their pain, from expert help may be covertly pro-suicide. (Of course, people sometimes do have bad experience when seeking mental-health treatment, and it's fine to vent about those, but processing our own disappointment and frustration is entirely different from trying to destroy someone else's hope of getting help.)

* **Choices made by competent responders are always informed by the understanding that breaching someone's trust is traumatic and must be avoided if possible.**  Any kind of involuntary intervention is an **extremely unlikely** outcome when someone consults a clinician or calls a hotline. (Confidentiality is addressed in more detail in [our Hotlines FAQ post](http://redd.it/1c7ntr)). The goal is always to provide all help with the client's full knowledge and informed consent. We know that no individual or system is perfect.  Mistakes that lead to bad experiences do sometimes happen to vulnerable people, and we have enormous sympathy for them.

Reminder: Absolutely no activism of any kind is allowed here. Any day.,"If you want to recognise an occasion, please do so by offering extra support to those who've asked for it, and by being a good citizen of the community, mindful of our tips and guidelines.

Edit:  In response to multiple requests, I'm adding a definition of activism here:  ""campaigning to bring about political or social change"".  That's straight out of the OED, we aren't making any special interpretation of it. **Any post that is primarily about raising awareness or changing perceptions is activism according to the dictionary definition and thus a violation of the community rules.**

Some examples of the most common types of activists posts we were here, all of which are totally inappropriate:  

* Advocating for changes in laws around suicide

* Advocating for change in the mental-health system 

* Advocating for changes in cultural norms or common perceptions around mental-health.  These are often related to specific days devoted to specific causes, e.g. World Suicide Prevention Day

Keep in mind that our mission here is individual peer support.  Any post that's not a request for personal support regarding current experience related to suicide is probably a rule violation unless it has the ""Mod Approved"" flair.",SQLwitch,124,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/d2370x/reminder_absolutely_no_activism_of_any_kind_is/,want recognise occasion please offering extra support asked good citizen community mindful tip guideline edit response multiple request adding definition activism campaigning bring political social change straight oed making special interpretation post primarily raising awareness changing perception activism according dictionary definition thus violation community rule example common type activist post totally inappropriate advocating change law around suicide advocating change mental health system advocating change cultural norm common perception around mental health often related specific day devoted specific cause e g world suicide prevention day keep mind mission individual peer support post request personal support regarding current experience related suicide probably rule violation unless ha mod approved flair,reminder absolutely activism kind allowed day,sql witch,1232,70,sql witch want recognise occasion please offering extra support asked good citizen community mindful tip guideline edit response multiple request adding definition activism campaigning bring political social change straight oed making special interpretation post primarily raising awareness changing perception activism according dictionary definition thus violation community rule example common type activist post totally inappropriate advocating change law around suicide advocating change mental health system advocating change cultural norm common perception around mental health often related specific day devoted specific cause e g world suicide prevention day keep mind mission individual peer support post request personal support regarding current experience related suicide probably rule violation unless ha mod approved flair reminder absolutely activism kind allowed day

"8 years ago I posted here, wanting to die. My life is so much better now.","When I was 15-16 years old, I posted here in my darkest moments. I couldn't see any reason to keep living. I thought I was nothing special and the next 8 years seemed like an endless slog. You can look through my post history if you want. 

Since then, I graduated college and graduate school. I have traveled the world. I swam with bioluminescent algae in Indonesia. I've hiked among alpacas in Peru. I learned to speak Spanish fluently and connected with people around the world, and in my own country, who speak Spanish too. I've published my writing i  multiple publications. I have fallen in love and had my heart broken several times. I realized I'm gay, came out, and I'm with the most amazing woman. I have a career that I love where I help people every day. I can honestly say that depression may be a lifelong struggle for me, but it is possible to recover and develop tools to cope with it. Every day is a manageable challenge now. Every day I am grateful to just be alive. I am SO GLAD that I didn't kill myself 8 years ago. I never would have known how beautiful my life could become.

Before you think about killing yourself, remember that you don't know how beautiful your life could become. How could you? You have no way of knowing until you get there.

I wasn’t supposed to live past being a teenager,"The stability in my mental health comes and goes and right now it’s particularly bad. I have suffered from mental health issues since I was a child, and it was particularly bad in my teenage years. Mental illness along with multiple suicide attempts destroyed my memory, and I feel like losing my teenage years to mental illness impaired me as an adult. 

I’m in university now, I do my work, get decent grades, but I don’t know what I’m doing. I don’t enjoy anything, my program is okay but I don’t see my future like so many people do. I struggle to make real connections with people, I am so emotionally unavailable and have hurt so many people leading them on and being unable to commit to them. I also barely enjoy sex and am traumatized from being sexually assaulted after a graduation party. I am wasting away my young adult years now, and soon enough I’ll regret not doing anything with my time. Therapy has never worked for me. I can safely say that I am a ghost of who I was, and who I could’ve been. I pretend and pretend but this part of me always seeps through the cracks. I want it to all end but I don’t think I could ever die, I am an only child and only daughter and it would tear my family apart. I’m just stuck.

My suicide note,"I don’t know when I will pass. I don’t know how many people will know or care. I only want this to say to my parents and siblings and all relatives: I’m sorry. I’m greatly sorry. I will miss you all. But, I cannot continue the journey. 

I wasn’t blessed with looks, brains, talents, or really anything. My passions fizzle out and every ounce of optimism is but a coping tool for misery. I cannot continue down this road. All of those who pass me by, I know I wasn’t worth your time, but just know how blessed you are. With looks, brains, talents. 

Deep down maybe it is just a series of self inflicted devilish mistakes in manipulation and childhood traumas of sexual and psychological abuse. I blame myself wholeheartedly for all my actions and I blame myself for the actions made against me. I am a wretch. I am terrible. 

The only thing I can die with is hoping to meet a loving God. Or perhaps that I was a lonely god. One who created a world from loneliness. One who dreamt it all up. But, with all the suffering and pain and lost desires, God may have forsaken me. And if this is just a Dream then i made one terrible dream. 

I don’t really want to die. But I need to. It’s time I must be going. Mom, everytime you see anything that reminds you of me. Know that I’m sorry. I’m truly sorry.

"Completely Disassociated from life, no actual reason to live that has any significance","What to do when it doesn't matter if your happy or sad or miserable, loved etc just tired of living?

I know there's no after life and even if there was I would be fine in hell I would actually prefer it there. Just uninterested in participating in this world not for negative reasons more like boredom plus the fact I've always hated my parents for even creating me. Not like I don't enjoy things or have good memories more like cool I came and saw and now I'm bored and wish to move on and rest eternally. Any ideas on similar feelings.

I can't keep doing this,"(Venting, throwaway account for privacy.)

My mind is blank. I cannot think. I don't want to eat. I don't want to try anymore. I've been trying for almost 30 years now. It hasn't gotten better like everyone said it would. It's just been a series of ups and downs, a rollercoaster that never seems to end. I fucking hate it.

My partner's grad program fucked us over with direct deposit again, so now all our bills are gonna be overdue. Again. We barely have food in the house, and neither of us have had the mental energy lately to cook what we do have. I could pick up more shifts to work all weekend for pennies to try and slowly pay a tiny bit of everything off, but I won't be able to make enough to pay everything. I'll work myself to the brink of death again just to barely get by, smoke to get through the day, and drink to fall asleep at night. Or I could just end it all.

My partner knows I'm mentally ill and tries their best. They go above and beyond any efforts I've ever seen, including my own parents. I don't want to leave them behind. I feel so guilty for feeling this way. But I just can't keep going like this. I want this to be over. And there's no end in sight.

I don’t want to do this anymore,"I have been struggling for a while now. 
For as long as I can remember, I’ve always wondered what’s the point of being alive. 
I’ve had good moments, but they have never lasted.

Then I met you. After being alone and lonely for years, I fell in love with you.
You’ve made me happy, you’ve made me sad, you’ve given me confidence, you’ve made me feel awful. 
You’ve played with me. 
You’ve made promises you never intended to keep.
I’ve made choices so we could be together.
I’ve pictured a whole life for us.
And then you’ve changed your mind.
You’ve managed to destroy me. 

I shouldn’t have let you destroy me. I was weak in the first place. 

What’s the point of being alive and being alone? I don’t have you anymore, I don’t have friends. I have work and that’s all. And work gets boring. You don’t live just to work. 

I just feel like I’m ready to give up. I don’t believe it can get better anymore, because if it does get better, it’s only going to get worse afterwards.

I know that you were in a very dark place yourself and that you have since deleted your account (you had mentioned it was a throw away) but I just want to know if you are still out there and if you are still 'okay'.

I know you browsed this subreddit a lot and you always checked up on other people and talked to a ton of others, now I want to check up on you.

What is the point of living?,"8 months ago, the love of my life left me. I put everything I had into salvaging the relationship, but in the end even offering to uproot my whole life for her, it wasn't enough. I sunk really low, but I had a friend who helped me through it and did everything in his power to help me out. I went to theropy for a bit but found it far more stressful than useful, so I turned to self help books. I started to think more positively, have a bit, more confidence in my self, and felt like I genuinely self improved. That countied until a few days ago. I got rejected by someone I really cared about, and it didn't go well.

After farther reflection, I haven't made progress on any of the goals I set to fix myself, even though I put in all my effort. My little confidence I gained is shattered. For the last few days, I have though about sueicde a lot, to the point where I don't go into work anymore because there is no point. That friend I had has moved up in life, to the point where I feel if I reach out to him I will just be a burden anyways. I am not close to my family at all, and if they knew I was depressed they would tell me to suck it up.

birthday blues,"I turn twenty-two soon and things are falling apart. I know I have it better than a lot of people— I have so much to be grateful for. I try to remember those things and keep them front and center. It’s a big year for me and there are so many due dates, deadlines and things to do— But I can hardly bring myself to get out of bed. I just don’t know what the point is, what the end goal is. I feel the only things really keeping me here is my sweet little cat and my mother. I just can’t shake this strange feeling that I am an outsider in everything I do and everywhere I go. I am tired of it and I just want it to stop. 

I feel guilty for existing. It’s like imposter syndrome but for being a person. I feel as though I don’t have the abilities needed to make my dreams come true, to be genuinely loved by someone, to be resilient enough to withstand the heartache I feel now and the heartache that is inevitably to come. I feel too old to still be self harming and feeling like a ghost. I feel like I don’t exist already, but somehow I’m still here.

Little ways to revitalize your routine.,"Recently, I've realized just how important variety and freshness is in everyday life. I know that many of the tips I will list below are not possible when you are in a particularly dark place, but I thought I'd mention them anyway — perhaps something will be of help to you. Here are a few things that help me keep overwhelming bouts of anxiety and ideation at bay: 

* Push yourself to wake up a little earlier. Stretch slowly with deep breaths and take a walk around your neighborhood as the sky turns rosy-yellow. Try to appreciate the new day; think of something, anything, to look forward to. Return home for a  warm shower and freshly-laundered clothes.
* Sleep a little bit earlier. Wash your sheets and buy a few soft blankets to make your bed into a cozy sanctuary. Allot time for reading or journalling to clear your mind.
* Allot time to cook simple, lovely meals. Steam fresh vegetables, cook some rice, or cut up a fruit salad of apples, bananas, and citrus. Eat mindfully and drink plenty of water. 
* Buy a well-bound journal and a good quality pen. Write down achievable to-do lists, make calendars, note groceries, thoughts, haikus —  anything. Put your thoughts in ink; appreciate daily observations. 
* Reorganize your space, or at least a little section of it. Listen to a nice podcast as you do so. Put your sheets and pillowcase into the laundry. Clear out your shelves and drawers, sort through everything, and replace it all neatly. Light a lovely candle and add some fresh flowers. Open a window or two.
* Buy or borrow a book on any topic which sparks even the slightest interest. Crocheting? Botany? Medieval history? Delving into a new topic just for the sake of it is worthwhile.
* Embrace non-competitive hobbies. This is incredibly important in a product(ivity)-obsessed society which devalues craftsmanship and pure interests. Activities like the following enrich your daily life and force you to set aside some time away from mandatory tasks: needle-felting, gardening, writing (poems, books, articles, blogs), painting, photography, wood-whittling, typography, graphic design, etc. Ensure that whatever you choose, the hobby involves holding the  fruits of your labor in your hands. You do not have to be ""good"" at it –  this is not a career choice. Watching yourself grow and have fun with  it is success in and of itself.

I hope you are doing well — I'm glad you are here, reading this.

"Feeling like there’s no point, scared of the future.","I just feel like it’s always something with me. I’m not doing anything big or exciting or impactful. I’m turning 25 in a few days, I’m married to a good man who loves me but we’ve struggled with communication and compatibility so we’ve been in therapy working on it. It’s hard work. He’s worth it, I love him, I’m in love with him, he’s my best friend and partner, but I didn’t think it would be this hard. Nobody talks about how hard being a couple is, it’s all “it shouldn’t be hard with the right person” and that makes me feel like a failure. I feel like a failure in everything in my life. I can’t keep a job, I’m currently unemployed and have no skills or qualifications in anything that is even remotely interesting to me. I hate not contributing financially and we’re struggling. We can barely eat right now, it’s humiliating. And it’s my fault. I struggle with infertility, all we want is to start our family. I can’t even do that. I never finished college and I have the debt to remind me every day. It’s not going to get easier. I’m an adult. Nothing significant is going to change and make things easier. I’ll never have the life I dream of, so what’s the point?

I’ve overcome so much with anxiety and OCD. But it’s still here and it really burns me out sometimes. I keep thinking about my future and how scary it is to age. I’m not afraid of dying, but I’m afraid of ceasing to exist if that makes sense. Who will be there at the end? Will I get sick? Will my husband? We could be in accidents, I could lose him to something traumatic, anything could happen. How do people live their whole lives? Becoming 40 feels so unrealistic.

Despresso,"Hi, I am having a v intense realization that I’ve been depressed for a very long time. Though you wouldn’t think that if you met me. Every day I slap on a smile and ask myself, “what kind of beauty am I going to see today?” and I allow life to flow. People say I’m so nice and so happy, so fun and charming. I had gotten so good at it I had even convinced myself for the passed 10yrs that I’ve been happy. Truth is though I don’t think I’d know happiness if it hit me in the face. 
I think I’ve been depressed since young childhood, coming from a wildly dysfunctional military home, being constantly bullied, I turned to sex drugs and alcohol at a very young age in order to cope. Now I’m 25, in a big city, feeling more isolated than ever. I work two jobs, I was going to university but decided to drop out to do a trade. I decided to be poly because I felt so lonely in monogamous relationships but poly has been nothing but heartache. I live with a close friend who doesn’t clean at all and constantly has his girl friend over even tho he works nights and she has her own apartment. I don’t know how to set boundaries because no one has ever respected them. I’ve been in and out of therapy (currently out but I guess almost back in). I’ve been assaulted and abused.

I think I will be alone forever,"After being in such a long, unhealthy and abusive relationship, I have been dating again. 

At first I was optimistic. At this point, after so many dates that went nowhere, I don't think I will ever find someone to be with for the rest of my life. I haven't felt like I really clicked with anyone. The men who seem to have the right qualities aren't interested in me.   

Nobody normal is interested in dating a disabled person, even when it's an invisible disability. Even being attractive can't overcome that. I have no career because I got sick. Nobody wants to deal with that. 

I'm tired of seeing everyone else in happy marriages with families. It just reminds me that I'm not good enough and won't ever be. I'd rather just die than be alone for the rest of my life.

I have a lot of great qualities and a lot of love to give. Just no one to share any of it with. I feel like today might be a bad day for me.

It’s not okay.,"The other day I realised that how I felt wasn’t just my pain it was my mother’s too. 

I haven’t felt suicidal for about a year now, in fact after recent medical problems all I’ve wanted to do is live a normal life. I have always been a sad person, naturally and I suppose this can take a toll on the people around you but it was only the other night that I saw just how much it could. 

Every night my mother stands outside my door and says “Goodnight love you sweet pea” to which I ALWAYS reply. Except this night I had a headache so I forgot about staying up later than my parents so I could check all the doors were locked. Instead at around 9 I went to sleep. About half an hour and a half later when my mum was going to bed I woke to see her standing at my door. I was half asleep so I said “I’m trying to sleep” and she apologised and went to bed

The next morning I questioned her on why she stood at my door and she said “Every night I say goodnight and it’s not just to remind you it’s for me to check you’re still alive but last night you didn’t respond and I went to go to bed but I stopped went back an said goodnight through the door again and you didn’t answer so I opened the door and thought oh she’s asleep but then as I walked a way a voice in my head said you were dead so I stood at your door waiting to see you breathe. 

The point is even though I moved on and that I haven’t felt depressed for over a year my mother still does every single day. No mother should have to worry like that. It’s not selfish and I’m not saying that I’m just saying that it’s not okay.",Lorelai-Diormand,1,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/febvty/its_not_okay/,day realised felt pain wa mother felt suicidal year fact recent medical problem wanted live normal life always sad person naturally suppose take toll people around wa night saw much could every night mother stand outside door say goodnight love sweet pea always reply except night headache forgot staying later parent could check door locked instead around 9 went sleep half hour half later mum wa going bed woke see standing door wa half asleep said trying sleep apologised went bed next morning questioned stood door said every night say goodnight remind check still alive last night respond went go bed stopped went back said goodnight door answer opened door thought oh asleep walked way voice head said dead stood door waiting see breathe point even though moved felt depressed year mother still doe every single day mother worry like selfish saying saying okay,okay,lorelai dior,1587,14,lorelai dior day realised felt pain wa mother felt suicidal year fact recent medical problem wanted live normal life always sad person naturally suppose take toll people around wa night saw much could every night mother stand outside door say goodnight love sweet pea always reply except night headache forgot staying later parent could check door locked instead around 9 went sleep half hour half later mum wa going bed woke see standing door wa half asleep said trying sleep apologised went bed next morning questioned stood door said every night say goodnight remind check still alive last night respond went go bed stopped went back said goodnight door answer opened door thought oh asleep walked way voice head said dead stood door waiting see breathe point even though moved felt depressed year mother still doe every single day mother worry like selfish saying saying okay okay

There is nothing left of me,"This is my first ever post on reddit. A friend of mine said I should post here and I’ve been finding every excuse not to but I am afraid that I have nothing left so why not? Here goes....I’ve literally given everything I have to my marriage and I’m not getting anything in return. We have 4 amazing children together  and they are everything to me but often times I feel like it’s only a matter of time before they realize I’m not worth their time and they too move on from me. I found out my wife was cheating on me and for some reason I still wanted to work things out with her. Well fast forward 4 months later and things are happening with another guy. Every confrontation about it is basically flipped and I’m made to feel like this is all my fault. I’ve never cheated on her and I’ve never thought about it a single time. I’m feeling so low that I don’t want to be here anymore. I feel like a stranger in my own home. People tell me to think of my children but what good is that when you truly believe they will be better off without you? I’m not worth trying to make a marriage work so why would I be worth it to them? They didn’t even choose me. I attempted suicide before, just before Christmas. My sister-in-law found me and called 911 and I ended up in a hospital for a week. I promised I would never let that happen again but I just can’t help the thoughts coming back.

I'm falling out of my work schedule, every night thinking of how I would end myself until i realize I'm thinking about it. The past six months have been so hard on me, and I'm only 20. I know i have many years more to live but it feels so hopeless as i think that I'm gonna die one day, why keep feeling like this forever? I feel like I have no hold over my life, I cant stay in one place for long, much less keep a steady job. In the moment I just say fuck it and quit and move on to another, I dropped out and am an alcoholic. I cant clean because it feels hopeless as well, everything just piles up until I'm at this point, and this time i dont know if i can move on. My dreams are repetitive and of the same person, and i cant shake that no matter what i try. Right now just seems like the time to save my family the pain of doing it later and just ending it. I dont know what to do. I want to make an impact on the world but know the chances are oh so slim, and it seems a lot easier to die.",PaulCorporations,0,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/fehqcz/suicidal_thoughts_please_help_if_you_can/,month overwhelming lost multiple friend last two month alone due act dont think exactly wrong kept 2 3 friend wont contact feel insignificant contacting gotten response twice falling work schedule every night thinking would end realize thinking past six month hard 20 know many year live feel hopeless think gonna die one day keep feeling like forever feel like hold life cant stay one place long much le keep steady job moment say fuck quit move another dropped alcoholic cant clean feel hopeless well everything pile point time dont know move dream repetitive person cant shake matter try right seems like time save family pain later ending dont know want make impact world know chance oh slim seems lot easier die,suicidal thought please help,paul corporation,1303,42,paul corporation month overwhelming lost multiple friend last two month alone due act dont think exactly wrong kept 2 3 friend wont contact feel insignificant contacting gotten response twice falling work schedule every night thinking would end realize thinking past six month hard 20 know many year live feel hopeless think gonna die one day keep feeling like forever feel like hold life cant stay one place long much le keep steady job moment say fuck quit move another dropped alcoholic cant clean feel hopeless well everything pile point time dont know move dream repetitive person cant shake matter try right seems like time save family pain later ending dont know want make impact world know chance oh slim seems lot easier die suicidal thought please help
I'm going to be a bad mom anyway so I may as well die.,"I had a baby recently and regret ever getting pregnant so much. My PTSD is back after giving birth full force and my life is unlivable. My body is ruined. Maybe i'm stupid but I didn't know it would destroy my body or I would have aborted. And I know that's horrible and sounds super vain. But it's not vain. I don't care how i look in clothes or what other people think of how I look. I just need to feel comfortable in my body and like it belongs to me. And I don't. As a result I can't not wear a bra even in my own home because I have so much anxiety about it. Even if it's just me and the baby at home. So i'm always uncomfortable. If someone rings the buzzer i jump and scream. I can't let my partner see my body at all. The thought sends me into a panic attack. So we can't shower together, I sleep fully clothed, I have to go to a different room to change and close the door. No sex ever again. I know he's just going to hate me one day and leave anyway because me being so messed up will drive him away. I can't live my life like this. I can't be a mom like this. 

I'm waiting to talk to my therapist again on Monday to explain it all and see if he can help with the PTSD. I have ppd too but that's not even a big deal. I have had PTSD and depression all my life. I can cope with some moderate depression. But these body issues I will never be able to get over. 

I'm waiting to see how my body ""settles"" but that's going to take 6 months to 2 years. If I can't live with it i'm going to kill myself. I can't live the rest of my life like this in agony every day. It's only been 2 months but I don't know how much longer I can wait.  I don't know if I can make it to 6 months.",waitingwaitress,33,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/fe9u0x/im_going_to_be_a_bad_mom_anyway_so_i_may_as_well/,baby recently regret ever getting pregnant much ptsd back giving birth full force life unlivable body ruined maybe stupid know would destroy body would aborted know horrible sound super vain vain care look clothes people think look need feel comfortable body like belongs result wear bra even home much anxiety even baby home always uncomfortable someone ring buzzer jump scream let partner see body thought sends panic attack shower together sleep fully clothed go different room change close door sex ever know going hate one day leave anyway messed drive away live life like mom like waiting talk therapist monday explain see help ptsd ppd even big deal ptsd depression life cope moderate depression body issue never able get waiting see body settle going take 6 month 2 year live going kill live rest life like agony every day 2 month know much longer wait know make 6 month,going bad mom anyway may well die,waiting waitress,1686,54,waiting waitress baby recently regret ever getting pregnant much ptsd back giving birth full force life unlivable body ruined maybe stupid know would destroy body would aborted know horrible sound super vain vain care look clothes people think look need feel comfortable body like belongs result wear bra even home much anxiety even baby home always uncomfortable someone ring buzzer jump scream let partner see body thought sends panic attack shower together sleep fully clothed go different room change close door sex ever know going hate one day leave anyway messed drive away live life like mom like waiting talk therapist monday explain see help ptsd ppd even big deal ptsd depression life cope moderate depression body issue never able get waiting see body settle going take 6 month 2 year live going kill live rest life like agony every day 2 month know much longer wait know make 6 month going bad mom anyway may well die

Feeling like I'm just passing time until I die,"By nature of my mental health conditions, I'm someone who doesnt really have any aspirations in life and even if I did I wouldnt have the energy or stability to achieve it, as has proven to be the case in the past. I wouldnt say im depressed but more just apathetic and accepting of the thought that nothing will change, that this is as good as it gets. I've experienced all that I've wanted to experience so what more is there to do except wait to die? 

Im not interested in marriage, children or any type of career. I just spend all day sleeping, eating and watching TV which is getting boring after doing it for several years. It wouldnt be so bad if I could enjoy some of my solitary hobbies that I used to enjoy but now I just pick something up and then lose interest within a few minutes. It just feels like I'm delaying the inevitable at this point as I dont know how many more years I can put up with doing the same old crap until something other than myself kills me.

I feel guilty for thinking it but I just wish that my 2 family members that I'm close to would die just so that I can't feel guilty in my last moments about leaving them with grief. Then again, I know it'd be a relief for them in a way knowing that I wont be hopelessly trying to survive without them in this life. It's becoming easier to see the potential positives to me killing myself compared to the negatives. 

What's worse is that I'm transgender and have completed my transition (F&gt;M) but rather than it being a lease of life, its become more like a 'phew, at least now I can die in peace' type of situation. So theres a peaceful element involved now which makes it all the more tempting.

At the end of this year i planned to kill myself but i dont think im gonna make it.,"For the last 7 years ive had horrible stomach problems, i throw up atleast 4 days every week, i feel nauseous constantly, i have a ton of pain in my stomach, and after all these years ive gotten so malnourished and worn out that every part of my body is in pain. Ive seen numerous Gi specialists who have all told me that im in perfect health, despite their best efforts nothing they have tried has ever worked. The last specialist i saw basically told me that everything had been tried and there was nothing left for him to do, he gave me a few meds to try but they didnt help at all. Ive been seeking help with my mental health for over 5 years but in the end everyone ive seen has either dismissed me immediately or kicked me out after a year of not helping. The last time i tried to get help i ended up getting seen for maybe 5 minutes then told i had mild depression and given a recommendation to take back to my GP. The final nail in the coffin was yesterday when i went to see an ENT after over a year of waiting, ive had what i thought was sinusitis but just like every other doctor he told me i was perfectly healthy and that he couldnt help me. Honestly the ""sinus infection"" was the one thing i thought i actually understood but now that even that isnt real my mind just feels shattered. I thought i could atleast make it through the year, hopefully see another specialist and try even more tests but now i just cant see the point. All its going to bring is more frustration and depression, i feel like i should just do everyone a favor and kill myself. Everyone would be much better off without a piece of shit like me around, i know my parents would be upset for a while but in the end they would be far more happy if i was gone.

Committing Emotional Suicide,"Hello, I genuinely want to die. It’s been like this for months now (it somehow only grew worse), and I really thought antidepressants would magically cure me, but I haven’t been feeling much of a difference.

I can’t kill myself because of the emotional toll it would have on my family, so if I can’t do that, what can I do?

I think the next best thing is to commit “emotional suicide”. Living each day being practically dead, yet somehow alive. I’ve been trying so hard to get better, but every fibre of my being wants to die.

If I lived each day being a zombie, with little to no emotions, I think it would be better than feeling constant dread.

I don’t even know anymore, I just deeply loathe myself, but I don’t know what to do. I’m even supposed to be at school right now, but I felt extremely shitty, and couldn’t even manage to muster up a shred of self-esteem to present myself at school.",starry-night-230,5,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/fec6gn/committing_emotional_suicide/,hello genuinely want die like month somehow grew worse really thought antidepressant would magically cure feeling much difference kill emotional toll would family think next best thing commit emotional suicide living day practically dead yet somehow alive trying hard get better every fibre want die lived day zombie little emotion think would better feeling constant dread even know anymore deeply loathe know even supposed school right felt extremely shitty even manage muster shred self esteem present school,committing emotional suicide,starry night 230,899,28,starry night 230 hello genuinely want die like month somehow grew worse really thought antidepressant would magically cure feeling much difference kill emotional toll would family think next best thing commit emotional suicide living day practically dead yet somehow alive trying hard get better every fibre want die lived day zombie little emotion think would better feeling constant dread even know anymore deeply loathe know even supposed school right felt extremely shitty even manage muster shred self esteem present school committing emotional suicide
Is it really such a bad thing?,"Hey, this is really weird for me and I wouldn’t normally do something like this but I don’t really know what else to do. Ever since I was a little kid I have thought life was pretty pointless and I kinda just wanted to die. As I grew up it gradually got worse and at this point I seriously just want to kill myself. I don’t have a bad life or anything I have just been searching for so long and I’ve never found a reason to want to be here. I have always had a problem making friends, I am always there for people and I love being able to help people, people just don’t like me. It could be a perception thing tho. In any case, I just spent two years with someone who I believe to be one of the most amazing people in the world, I loved him so much and genuinely thought I would spend the rest of my life with him but he broke up with me. He told me he was never happy with me and it broke me. I have met millions of people and I don’t believe I will ever be happy with someone like I was with him. I can’t be happy without him and he can’t be happy with me but to be his friend and see him happy with someone else would tear me to pieces. Everyone says I’ll move on and be happy again but it’s been months and it still feels fresh as the day it happened. The only reason I am still here is because of my mom. She guilt trips me into not committing suicide even though she has also always been suicidal. She also doesn’t believe in therapy and thinks making your bed will make the depression go away. The idea of killing my self isn’t scary to me and I know the people in my life will be sad but I am not enough of anything to anyone for it to be a big deal. Idk why I’m posting this, guess I’m just wondering what other people think about it.",Sp0ng3bl0b,0,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/fegrkj/is_it_really_such_a_bad_thing/,hey really weird normally something like really know else ever since wa little kid thought life wa pretty pointless kinda wanted die grew gradually got worse point seriously want kill bad life anything searching long never found reason want always problem making friend always people love able help people people like could perception thing tho case spent two year someone believe one amazing people world loved much genuinely thought would spend rest life broke told wa never happy broke met million people believe ever happy someone like wa happy without happy friend see happy someone else would tear piece everyone say move happy month still feel fresh day happened reason still mom guilt trip committing suicide even though ha also always suicidal also believe therapy think making bed make depression go away idea killing self scary know people life sad enough anything anyone big deal idk posting guess wondering people think,really bad thing,sp 0 ng 3 bl 0 b,1743,30,sp 0 ng 3 bl 0 b hey really weird normally something like really know else ever since wa little kid thought life wa pretty pointless kinda wanted die grew gradually got worse point seriously want kill bad life anything searching long never found reason want always problem making friend always people love able help people people like could perception thing tho case spent two year someone believe one amazing people world loved much genuinely thought would spend rest life broke told wa never happy broke met million people believe ever happy someone like wa happy without happy friend see happy someone else would tear piece everyone say move happy month still feel fresh day happened reason still mom guilt trip committing suicide even though ha also always suicidal also believe therapy think making bed make depression go away idea killing self scary know people life sad enough anything anyone big deal idk posting guess wondering people think really bad thing
"It’s Friday, and you need to read this.","Today’s the day to get out of bed! Get off that couch, or get the hell out of that chair, y’all. Start by sitting up wherever you are right this second. 

Right now, I want you to take a deep breath in through your nose, and slowly breathe it out through your mouth. Take another deep breath in, this time focus on the roof of your mouth and your tongue; relax those muscles, let your tongue fall away from the roof of your mouth, and breathe all the way out. Repeat this breathing technique, focusing further on your lungs and your rib cage. Feel each breath slowly touching your nostrils, pulling downward into your chest, filling your lungs. Consider your posture now, letting your shoulders roll back and your neck pull up as your lungs fill with fresh air. 

Your body is likely sore from sleeping too much, or not enough, and I know that story all too well. 

You’re alive today, and I challenge you to stand up, stretch the body your mind has been neglecting, and get into the shower.

Boyfriend had suicide plan,"I've never posted before but I feel at a loss and can't seem to find anything online similar so figured I'd post. 
Bit of backstory my boyfriend (5 years) had called me while I was at work on Monday saying that he was checking himself into a mental health hospital. I knew roughly why he would be there but it was still such a shock to me. It wasnt until a few days later that he opened up to me and said that he had made a plan and chose out the weapon but decided after his therapy session that he didnt want to do it anymore. So it's a weird in between spot. While he didnt necessarily attempt suicide he was damn close. Closer than I ever could have imagined.
I had just started a new job with a bakery about a month ago and then this happened. I've had a hard time coping with everything and so I told my boss I probably wouldn't be back until the following Monday. Fast forward to Friday I get a call from one of my friends who helped get me the job and she's saying that my work team is trying to be understanding but that they think and my friend thinks I'm being immature and irresponsible for not going to work. My friend even went far enough to say that maybe I wasn't strong enough for my boyfriend since I couldn't find it in myself to go to work through this. 
I guess I'm asking for advice. My friend said my work is talking about cutting my hours since now I've shown I'm not reliable even though before this happened I had never so much as shown up late before or called out. What would you do? I feel at a loss because yes I realize I should be working but I don't know how to face my work after this especially knowing they are annoyed with me.",smendy517,1,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/feg91y/boyfriend_had_suicide_plan/,never posted feel loss seem find anything online similar figured post bit backstory boyfriend 5 year called wa work monday saying wa checking mental health hospital knew roughly would wa still shock wasnt day later opened said made plan chose weapon decided therapy session didnt want anymore weird spot didnt necessarily attempt suicide wa damn close closer ever could imagined started new job bakery month ago happened hard time coping everything told bos probably back following monday fast forward friday get call one friend helped get job saying work team trying understanding think friend think immature irresponsible going work friend even went far enough say maybe strong enough boyfriend since find go work guess asking advice friend said work talking cutting hour since shown reliable even though happened never much shown late called would feel loss yes realize working know face work especially knowing annoyed,boyfriend suicide plan,mendy 517,1663,26,mendy 517 never posted feel loss seem find anything online similar figured post bit backstory boyfriend 5 year called wa work monday saying wa checking mental health hospital knew roughly would wa still shock wasnt day later opened said made plan chose weapon decided therapy session didnt want anymore weird spot didnt necessarily attempt suicide wa damn close closer ever could imagined started new job bakery month ago happened hard time coping everything told bos probably back following monday fast forward friday get call one friend helped get job saying work team trying understanding think friend think immature irresponsible going work friend even went far enough say maybe strong enough boyfriend since find go work guess asking advice friend said work talking cutting hour since shown reliable even though happened never much shown late called would feel loss yes realize working know face work especially knowing annoyed boyfriend suicide plan

No reason to keep on existing,"I'm new to this sub and while I was scrolling and reading a bunch of posts here I realized most of the people who want to end themselves, have at least one area in their lives that isn't shitty. Maybe they have a partner who love them, a job they find meaning in, or a couple of friends they love to be with.
But my case is closed to say the least, I'm 23 Y/ M I didn't finish college, I have no career, I'm unemployable and flat broke, I have zero friends, never been in a relationship and still holding on the V card, basically I'm one of those people who has no life, your average loser worthless piece of crap, consuming food and resources just to stay alive.
Add to that my severe anxiety and crippling depression, recently I started to experience physical pain cause of all the emotions trapped in my body.

everything is awful and I can't afford to be alive,"Howdy. I don't know why I'm posting like it's going to do anything for me but whatever. This is gonna be pretty wordy. A fella out here fighting the long fight. Everything's shit. Everything's been shit since I was like 11. There hasn't been a day in at least 5-6 years that suicide hasn't crossed my mind. I've managed to stay pretty functional. Less so now. I can't do anything. I'm used to having bad days. I'm used to that. But for the longest time my bad days were maximum 17 hours in bed then I get up to piss or something. It's different now. My bad days are 31 hours in bed no food or water. I don't go online, I don't talk to anyone, I just sulk. Everything's gone to shit. 

My family is big against any sort of therapy/mental illness sort of talk. I was too. Last year in August I broke down and started therapy because I knew I was slacking. I decided If not to change my mood, then to at least change my behavior. It helped for a while. Cut to December. I'm off my shit. I break down again and resort to meds. I've always been against meds for myself so idk maybe that adds some perspective. I felt like meds were the equivalent of me giving up my personality, becoming the masses. Pretentious I know but whatever. Meds don't do shit. I've had so many appointments with my psychiatrist to change my meds or the dosage but nothing has worked and it's been too long. 

I decided to go into an outpatient program in February. Things were really bad. I started disassociating very intensely. I can't feel my body move, I can't control my motions. It's one of the most terrifying things I've ever experienced. I went through the application process and got accepted into outpatient care. I was finally going to get thorough help. Confidentiality had been broken, relationships irreparable but I was going to do what I needed to do. The day I start I find out my insurance doesn't cover it.

I am so fucking tired of being too poor. I'm tired. It's so fucking humiliating to not be able to take care of yourself because you can't afford it. When I grew up everyone thought I was gonna be the kid to escape this shit. To break the cycle and actually make something of myself and be content. I was smart, I was bilingual and inventive and passionate and I learned about how to best fight my circumstances. I really thought I had a chance. But I don't.

There's no escaping the cycle of poverty. It comes back to bite no matter what you do.  My grades suffered because I didn't have a computer, or internet, or because I was losing my apartment or whatever the crisis might've been at the time. My grades are shit now, like a 1. something gpa. I can't get a scholarship and to be totally fucking honest I'm not sure I'd even graduate high school. I'm a financial drain on all my guardians. My mom won't buy me food, my dad is trying to not lose his other kid, and my grandma (who raised me) is forced to live with my dad and pay off the house because he can't afford it and knew he could leech off of her. I can't work because I'm already failing all my classes and I'm supposed to fix that.

The worst part is being aware of my situation. I can't afford to be healthy. I can't afford to be educated. I can't afford to be happy. How fucked up is that? I don't try and paint myself as the victim of this dumb ass capitalist society but come ON. It doesn't matter how I play the game. It doesn't matter how hard I try and be better. I can't pay for it. If I keep going, then in 10 years I'm gonna be a deadbeat working three jobs in some toxic relationship just like every other adult in my life. 

I can't have a life. I can't pay for it. If I kill myself that's like max a $7000 funeral. I have about a thousand and my family probably wouldn't spend that much anyway. Hell, if I can get rid of the body they won't even have to deal with that. No more food expenses, no more school expenses, no more health expenses. They can sell my shit, rent out my room, i don't care: I'll be fucking dead what do I need all this shit for? I can't keep up. Every time I turn a corner there's some new crisis to be dealt with. I can't keep doing this. Something has got to change and the only thing left to try is killing myself.",midwestmonstrosity,1,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/fecuma/everything_is_awful_and_i_cant_afford_to_be_alive/,howdy know posting like going anything whatever gonna pretty wordy fella fighting long fight everything shit everything shit since wa like 11 day least 5 6 year suicide crossed mind managed stay pretty functional le anything used bad day used longest time bad day maximum 17 hour bed get piss something different bad day 31 hour bed food water go online talk anyone sulk everything gone shit family big sort therapy mental illness sort talk wa last year august broke started therapy knew wa slacking decided change mood least change behavior helped cut december shit break resort med always med idk maybe add perspective felt like med equivalent giving personality becoming mass pretentious know whatever med shit many appointment psychiatrist change med dosage nothing ha worked long decided go outpatient program february thing really bad started disassociating intensely feel body move control motion one terrifying thing ever experienced went application process got accepted outpatient care wa finally going get thorough help confidentiality broken relationship irreparable wa going needed day start find insurance cover fucking tired poor tired fucking humiliating able take care afford grew everyone thought wa gonna kid escape shit break cycle actually make something content wa smart wa bilingual inventive passionate learned best fight circumstance really thought chance escaping cycle poverty come back bite matter grade suffered computer internet wa losing apartment whatever crisis might time grade shit like 1 something gpa get scholarship totally fucking honest sure even graduate high school financial drain guardian mom buy food dad trying lose kid grandma raised forced live dad pay house afford knew could leech work already failing class supposed fix worst part aware situation afford healthy afford educated afford happy fucked try paint victim dumb capitalist society come matter play game matter hard try better pay keep going 10 year gonna deadbeat working three job toxic relationship like every adult life life pay kill like max 7000 funeral thousand family probably spend much anyway hell get rid body even deal food expense school expense health expense sell shit rent room care fucking dead need shit keep every time turn corner new crisis dealt keep something ha got change thing left try killing,everything awful afford alive,midwest monstrosity,4218,50,midwest monstrosity howdy know posting like going anything whatever gonna pretty wordy fella fighting long fight everything shit everything shit since wa like 11 day least 5 6 year suicide crossed mind managed stay pretty functional le anything used bad day used longest time bad day maximum 17 hour bed get piss something different bad day 31 hour bed food water go online talk anyone sulk everything gone shit family big sort therapy mental illness sort talk wa last year august broke started therapy knew wa slacking decided change mood least change behavior helped cut december shit break resort med always med idk maybe add perspective felt like med equivalent giving personality becoming mass pretentious know whatever med shit many appointment psychiatrist change med dosage nothing ha worked long decided go outpatient program february thing really bad started disassociating intensely feel body move control motion one terrifying thing ever experienced went application process got accepted outpatient care wa finally going get thorough help confidentiality broken relationship irreparable wa going needed day start find insurance cover fucking tired poor tired fucking humiliating able take care afford grew everyone thought wa gonna kid escape shit break cycle actually make something content wa smart wa bilingual inventive passionate learned best fight circumstance really thought chance escaping cycle poverty come back bite matter grade suffered computer internet wa losing apartment whatever crisis might time grade shit like 1 something gpa get scholarship totally fucking honest sure even graduate high school financial drain guardian mom buy food dad trying lose kid grandma raised forced live dad pay house afford knew could leech work already failing class supposed fix worst part aware situation afford healthy afford educated afford happy fucked try paint victim dumb capitalist society come matter play game matter hard try better pay keep going 10 year gonna deadbeat working three job toxic relationship like every adult life life pay kill like max 7000 funeral thousand family probably spend much anyway hell get rid body even deal food expense school expense health expense sell shit rent room care fucking dead need shit keep every time turn corner new crisis dealt keep something ha got change thing left try killing everything awful afford alive

Relapsed,"Ive been going pretty good for some time.  
Got a flat, got a job, stayed clean for an almost year (except cigs and beers why I try limit as much as i can).  
I even had established morning routine before job like exercising and meditations. I were even writing daily journal which helped me a lot with memory and thinking. Exercising proved to be excelent whenever my attention started to go jumpy. I was going to sleep at exact time and woke a exact time same. It wasnt exactly perfect but it was better then before.   


And then i dont know  what happened. Guess its the freaking weather and loneliness along with overthinking that got me back into this moodiness.  
I guess I kind off hoped my father and mother would be freaking proud of me to stop dragging people into the same hole i was in and using.  
that they would be proud i found the job and keep it , that i try  even through i have health complications. But none of it happened. They each have their own families and im just a waste with no one to talk to except for my therapist and girlfriend. And I dont even know how to grateful to at least have someone since they dont understand how I am feeling.  
I just sit home trying to live someones else life inside comics and playing the same game over and over again even through i hate it. Trying to find a way to get away with assisted suicide because I cant do a shit right.  
Most depressing thing I realized is that it doesnt really matter how much i try to change myself. People instenctively hate me. That it doesnt matter if i try to live ""normal"" life. it still sucks. It doesnt matter if am clean or not , since no one cares. Everywhere i go theres this black cloud of my negativity transfering my bad ""mojo"" onto other people. Im burden to my gf since im most of the last month only sad piece of shit that cant do nothing to make this life better. Im burden even to her friends who took a pity on my cause im depressed shit.  
It doesnt even matter if i would die. No one cares a one piece of shit. All gonna be friends till I had money and drugs , they called adn talked about their problems , but now when im down theres no one.  
Im just waiting till dignitas answer me with mail so I can start preparing to leave this shitty hole called reality.   
Ive been trough so much.. Be it Abusive childhood, Abusive ex, Depressions since I was 11, Bullying, Drug addiction , anxieties, agoraphobia, so called ""desilusions"", Fake friends who destroyed any bit of my ability to trust a different human being, Being forced by a girl to almost having sex when i was 6, Constant Isolations ,School failures, being scapegoated, being hospitalised , tried to kill myself 3 times, Being left on my own my whole life with no support from my so called parents who just made everything worse. I cant get over it.   
I keep hearing all those bullshits like ""just change your thinking man"". How the heck am i supposed to change something that has been hardwired into my head for years when i was still a child.  


Id love to make comics, Id love to make music but i cant do anything else except for reading and playing over and over again , cause i have no energy to do anything. Worst part is I can hear laughing all the people I know. And even worse part is I know no one will answer this post again , cause theres just no other way than to ends this miserable piece of shit thats called my life.  
I hate all those people who think Assisted-suicide/Euthanasia shouldnt be avaible to people with mental illness. It is like saying ""people with cancer doesnt deserve to die a calm way.""  


All my life i was trying to be better.. To help people around me.. And it cost me dearly.  
It really brought me down when I realized it doesnt matter. It doesnt matter i tried to save my mom from alcoholic, It just made things worse for me. It doesnt matter I tried to cheer people [up.It](https://up.It) doesnt matter Im clean. I dont know how to form this sentence , so ill just say it doesnt matter how hard I try. It always come back and i have to start again. But im tired of reabulding and rebuilding again and again.

I’ve prepared but I’m rethinking,"So I made this account so I could post without being known. I’ve prepared for my end in a way. I’m the only caretaker for my mom and it’s exhausting. I’ve given up having a childhood a long time ago and all my major moments in life from periods to dating has been done on my own. I have a lot of siblings but all are married and were gone before I reached high school. My dad was always in a sense abusive, mostly if I did something wrong in his eyes I was yelled at, slapped, etc. even now. Just yesterday he got frustrated because he got a phone call about work and in his frustration he grabbed the nearest thing and threw it at me. Which caused my hand to be bloody. I have a boyfriend, well had, who’s the absolute sweetest and the other day I broke up with him. I wanted him to not be hurt when I make the choice to go. He was the only goodbye I needed to make. I’m just so tired. So worn out. I want to stop being a burden and a drag down. If I’m gone my dad can finally know I’m not a disappointment because then I wont be alive to be one. Then this morning a video popped up, it was talking about there’s still a chance to get past this. If I go through it’ll be my 5th and last attempt. I think my boyfriend (ex) has figured out I’m going to do it. He keeps begging me not to. I want to do this to stop hurting people, I want to stop feeling hurt. I can’t seek help because in my culture from church and everything that means that you’d be completely turned away by the whole community. I’m just unsure of where to go.

I’m 19 and in college and I can’t find a reason to get out of bed anymore. I don’t find joy in anything, not even drawing, reading, or video games. I hate being alive and the only thing that’s kept me here is my boyfriend. I’m starting to resent him because of it and I despise that. I don’t know what to do. I went on a long walk and took a break from writing this and I’m still as lost as ever. I couldn’t even think straight, my mind just jumps from useless thing to useless thing.

I support everyone with everything they do, and I give people hundreds of chances to change. I make food for people. If someone has a problem, even a random person who hasn’t been the nicest, I will talk to them and try to give them solutions. I try to put out good karma into this world. I know I won’t be here much longer, so might as well make a positive impact. I try to not be stepped on either though. 

- Chronic inflammation and skin conditions (acne, eczema, every pore on my leg is purple and inflamed, eyelids are always inflamed and crusty and often swollen completely shut, family thinks I exaggerate these symptoms and that I just naturally look swollen and red or whatever)

- Zero friends. Not exaggerating. Not one friend. Never had a close friend before. I’ve had depression ever since I’m 10. I text some people occasionally but no one I’m close to who I can share my feelings or hang out with.

- Was raped. No one acknowledged, and when they did realize, told me to be more picky with my sexual partners. I couldn’t have been more picky. I was passed out.

- Not in school (even though I had a 4.2 GPA and 1550 SAT). Was homeschooled 10-12th grade high school. Went to liberal arts college in another state has manic/psychotic episodes had to go back home. Started community college but parents pulled me out during my depressive episode.

- No trust in men. I can never have a normal relationship. Besides being raped, I had men bombard me with videos of porn stars and detail why I wasn’t as hot as them, inspect me for flaws, take advantage of my past trauma as part of their kink, lie to me about being married, tell me that the only reason they like me is because I’m psycho or dumb, etc. I shouldn’t have been dating during this bad time. During my Klonopin withdrawal period, I had a panic attack and a guy just drove away.

- OCD thoughts nonstop. I’m scared of even thinking certain thoughts. I’m convinced certain thoughts or not having certainty thoughts will jinx my future. I’m scared I’m a sexual deviant (even though I have no libido and am a straight vanilla female with only 2 sexual partners ever 3 including rape). I’m convinced I’m becoming a hermaphrodite, or that I’m actually transgender. Weird thoughts.

- Eating disorder. Scared of being fat, also scared of being skinny. I just want to look ill. I don’t want to look like a girl that men fetishize. Look small and thin and pedophiles will want to rape me. Look curvy and I’ll be objectified. I can’t stop bingeing and purging. I was underweight then a guy was checking me out now I want to become fat.

- Mom harassed me for my nude photos. She imitated how I took the photos, this is what drove me to attempt suicide. She showed them to my dad and sister and now everyone thinks I’m a slut and my sister tells my cousin about how I sleep with many men on the first date. 

- Blatant preferential treatment for my sister. She gets her laptop fixed, I don’t. She gets haircuts, I don’t. While I was getting a seizure from Klonopin withdrawals, my mom was shopping for a custom coat for my sister for hours and when I told my mom what happened she said something like “oh that’s not nice.”

- Hundreds of people know my diagnosis and think I’m crazy. My sister had a fundraiser for mental illness to help her get into a good college and to make it more inspirational she shared my health information with many people who now treat me weird.

- Everyone outside our family like extended family and family friends also are super patronizing and treat me as this person you want to be cordial with but also not get close to and are super patronizing 

I need someone to talk to so badly. I’ve felt this way for so so so long. No one cares. I feel invisible. I swear I can tell aloud that I want to kill my self and no one would care. I wish someone could ask me if I’m ok. I’ve asked other people so many times if they’re ok can’t remember the last time I’ve been asked that.

Anyone else totally fucked?,"I wanted to die starting in Jan 2018, but things have only gotten worse.

In summer 2018, those fucks on the Suicide Prevention chatroom called the police when I expressed suicidal ideations, so I was kidnapped and sent to a series of hospital-prisons with junk medical staff. I lost my job due to the hospital stay - and my apartment, car, and dog shortly followed.

Can't get a decent job because my resume is now all fucked up and I have no connections, and I refuse to go back to miserable jobs that pay horribly. I'd rather die than do that for life.

I am about to be sued on $4K debt, and then yesterday I was handed a $6.5K medical bill for treatment that would have been 100% unnecessary had I still had insurance and was able to go to regular check ups.

You fucks on the Suicide Prevention line made my life demonstrably worse. You destroyed the mechanisms that kept me going as an independent and self-sufficient human. Now I have nothing and am in a far worse position (logistically speaking) to be dealing with any of this.

Right now I'm sort of just waiting until where I'm currently staying kicks me out, which should be soon. After that, it's time to die.

I am this close,"I maintain this cheery personality but in reality, I'm just barely getting along. No one cares about me, and I don't want to attempt suicide (for the third time). The first two attempts sucked, and I hate myself everyday for even trying. The first time, I lost nearly all of my memories from the past (retrograde amnesia), so I couldn't recognize most people that I knew. The second time was at a hospital and I was placed on suicide watch. Needless to say, my parents were/are scared ASF.

I use drugs to cope. Weed, Adderall, lean, alcohol, Xanax, Ambien, and LSD.

"Pooh, Piglet, and Eeyore","There's this thing that circles around my feed every once in a while, about how Eeyore is feeling low so he stays at his house instead of going out with Pooh and Piglet, so Pooh and Piglet go to his house, where Eeyore says he's not been hanging around with them because he's sad and low and not much fun to be around. So then Pooh and Piglet sit next to Eeyore and don't say anything, they just lend him their presence, with love and without judgment. And then, although he doesn't feel better, he \*does\* feel better.

I've got people like that, people who have straight up offered just to sit with me, who don't care how low I am or how un-fun I am to be with, they just love me. But the thing is, the thought of having someone just sit with me while I am dying inside -- I mean, I seriously can't even bear it. As much as I would be willing to do that for someone else, I simply cannot accept being on the receiving end of it.

What is that? It would be such a comfort to be so wholly accepted, to be so free of expectations and disappointment and pressure; but I can't even imagine it without spinning out.

And that’s where we need support. I woke up today and called out of my job and took a mental health day but I’m still feeling slightly suicidal. Life fucking sucks and I have no purpose. Religion destroyed me, and my job is emotionally draining but pays my bills so it’s a tough situation. I have a happy life with my partner so I feel guilty feeling like I want to die because he does make me genuinely happy but I often find myself too emotionally dependent on him because he is the only thing that makes me deeply happy.

Just cant seem to get ahead in life.,"I've always been a negative person in life. I'm 32, and decided I wanted to change..I got a job a shelter because I love people, and hate to see people that have to live life at the lowest. Basically I got a job at a shelter, and decided I would act on what I want to do as a career. Anyways the job is awesome, and I thought the homeless people would be hard to deal with, but no, it's no them, it's the coworker's that act like high school kids talking shit about the other coworkers. So I stay neutral when people say things about other people. We have this worker, and she's real mean to the  people. It's like you'll ask yourself why is she doing this kind of work if she hates people? She i feed this lady who gets to the shelter late, and the coworker gets mad at me since it was late.. she calls me a pushover, then I tell her, ""I'm not a pushover I just have compassion. And that makes her mad! So, she says sorry at first. Then wants to have the last.word with me. So, she goes off on me, and I go.off on her. She lies and says I threaten her, and I get sent home. I try and be positive and put myself in other people shoes who have less then me, and now I'm the bad guy. I probably wont have a job, and she'll still have one. Guess it's time end it. Can't get ahead no matter what. I'm 32, and thing's are not looking good. I have a family to take care of and my wife work part time. Im.fucked. I'm drunk. Sorry about the grammar.

Life sucks and I think there's something wrong with me.,"Ever since I came to the States for college, I've just been in a depressive state of mind. School killed my passion for what I wanted to do with a shit ton of work and almost no free time to myself. I want to change schools/take a gap year, but I am unable to do that due to financial reasons. I don't have friends in school. I have classmates, but they feel more like coworkers who are just concerned about themselves and their own career, more than friends. My family doesn't feel like a family; it's a nightmare where everyone hates each other. 

I used to be a very optimistic guy with very little pessimism. But now, I feel like my pessimistic side has taken over me. I *think* that there's an inner voice that tells me that I should go ahead and kill myself because it's an easy solution to every single problem I have. I also noticed that I'm not being my original self anymore. I lose patience way faster than I used to, I get upset more easily, and so much more. I feel like I've lost my own self. I don't know who I am anymore. Everything seems pointless and nothing motivates me to work hard and live life anymore.

BUT I know I shouldn't act on suicide. I understand that it's wrong and selfish. And my reasons to suicide are not reasonable AT ALL. I keep telling myself that I'm just in a rough patch of life and it's just a small hill that I'd have to climb over. 

School, on the other hand, is just a lot of work. The stress piled up from the amount of work, family issues, financial concerns, **and** my depressive shit thoughts does not help at all. Further, my procrastination absolutely fucked me over this semester. I'm going to fail my classes and probably have to retake them. My parents are going to be crazy mad at me, yet I don't care for some reason. My concerns aren't at school, but at life itself.

I don't know what to do. I don't know what I should do. I can't tell if I became a lazy person and now I'm trying to justify my laziness or if this is just my body's response to a lot of stress accumulated over the years.

Without a stable living situation and losing hope,"Just over a week ago I left a really shitty situation with parents who have treated me pretty awfully for years and I am finally free - however, I'm homeless. I have been staying with friends and I spend some time in crisis accommodation provided by my psychologist after I finally opened up to her about everything they have been doing to me, and it's just been really hard.

I'm having trouble getting the legal documents I need to secure a stable living situation, in my country so much of that is reliant on parental confirmation even though I am a legal adult, and I met up with my mum today to try and talk things out with her but I got brutalised and put down and just made to feel really worthless all over again. She couldn't even not be cruel to me after meeting for just one day after not seeing eachother for awhile, so I have decided to go no contact.

I feel really helpless. I feel like the systems in place quite literally fuck you over if you have abusive families, needing their birth certificates to verify things. I feel like it has been made near impossible for me to live independently without them but I know I can never go back because they have put me through so much trauma and so many things I know to not be okay and they have no remorse, and I'm never going to put up with that ever again.

I really don't want to go on anymore, I feel so weak, I have been trying so hard to get everything in order for 10 days straight and it has amounted to nothing, and I really feel like I have no other choice,",_I-Hate-Reddit_,0,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/feb52l/without_a_stable_living_situation_and_losing_hope/,week ago left really shitty situation parent treated pretty awfully year finally free however homeless staying friend spend time crisis accommodation provided psychologist finally opened everything really hard trouble getting legal document need secure stable living situation country much reliant parental confirmation even though legal adult met mum today try talk thing got brutalised put made feel really worthless even cruel meeting one day seeing eachother awhile decided go contact feel really helpless feel like system place quite literally fuck abusive family needing birth certificate verify thing feel like ha made near impossible live independently without know never go back put much trauma many thing know okay remorse never going put ever really want go anymore feel weak trying hard get everything order 10 day straight ha amounted nothing really feel like choice,without stable living situation losing hope,hate reddit,1527,49,hate reddit week ago left really shitty situation parent treated pretty awfully year finally free however homeless staying friend spend time crisis accommodation provided psychologist finally opened everything really hard trouble getting legal document need secure stable living situation country much reliant parental confirmation even though legal adult met mum today try talk thing got brutalised put made feel really worthless even cruel meeting one day seeing eachother awhile decided go contact feel really helpless feel like system place quite literally fuck abusive family needing birth certificate verify thing feel like ha made near impossible live independently without know never go back put much trauma many thing know okay remorse never going put ever really want go anymore feel weak trying hard get everything order 10 day straight ha amounted nothing really feel like choice without stable living situation losing hope
Just in case...,"I'm an 18 year old with severe depression, anxiety, ADHD, borderline personality disorder and DID at a point in my life. But I'm slowly recovering.

I have always felt like I never belonged to this world, because I am ""too imaginative"" and ""too kind"". I behave ""not like how people should"". I'm mostly well-liked, but I know they think I'm a weirdo. Everyone does.

It's final exam time for us, and I have to secure good marks, otherwise I won't be able to enter any good streams in a good college. It would be the end of my future. My family is in a financial crunch, but they give up everything for me. I am dead-set on helping my friends get through their depression and suicidal tendencies, but I'm failing at that. I have had three attempts, but I was saved by a person, who himself was alexithymic (I think) and suicidal. He still is, and he says if he doesn't do well, he will commit suicide.

I don't know what I'm gonna do if I don't perform the way I should. But I certainly know that I will die if he does.

In case everything goes wrong, I'll leave. There's no other way. The day of my death is nearing. It's just 3 months away.

✅21yo ✅no school ✅ family hates me ✅ alcooholic,"Me : 21yo french garbage
My parents made me go to engineering school, far from their home in paris, after 3 years of preparatory in maths and physics . I immediatly hated the school, i  did a few entreprise visit with my class and i knew i didnt want to be an engineer. I d rather kill myself than becoming one engislave. I made really good friends in this city tho, even if i wasn't going to school anymore  at one point i was still very happy because of them.

So i told my parents i wanted to stop engineering school, that i wanted to get a job until next year when i will go study something i always dreamt about, becoming a doctor. I went back home for holidays, 3 weeks ago.

I have rough background story with my parents, i'm always in conflict with them and until last summer they always solved conflicts by hitting me or insulting me, saying horrible things that made me hate them. They did make me sleep outside for a few days when i was still a good student in preparatory class, they made me bleed several times, my dad with a sharped stick of wood and my mom with her nails.

I told them i wanted to get a job in the city i was studying, far from home, because i could be near my friends. I told them being home with them was torture, that it was making me go insane and suicidal. I'm still at their home rn, i have a job, but i still want to go live in this city, with my friends and my girlfriend who lives there and to get a job there. Nobody talks to me at home, they took my computer and my credit card. I cant go out, i cant see any friend nearby, i cant do anything or enjoy life. 

They want me stay here, no discussion possible. They make me want to kill myself, they repeating every time i talk about my friends that they don't care about me, that they think i'm a looser and  a piece of shit because i stopped this school.

I want to go to this city next week, but i dont have my appartment anymore. I don't know how to convince them to pay the rent for just one month, the time for me to get a job and be independent.",Drivax,17,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/fdzh7r/21yo_no_school_family_hates_me_alcooholic/,21yo french garbage parent made go engineering school far home paris 3 year preparatory math physic immediatly hated school entreprise visit class knew didnt want engineer rather kill becoming one engislave made really good friend city tho even going school anymore one point wa still happy told parent wanted stop engineering school wanted get job next year go study something always dreamt becoming doctor went back home holiday 3 week ago rough background story parent always conflict last summer always solved conflict hitting insulting saying horrible thing made hate make sleep outside day wa still good student preparatory class made bleed several time dad sharped stick wood mom nail told wanted get job city wa studying far home could near friend told home wa torture wa making go insane suicidal still home rn job still want go live city friend girlfriend life get job nobody talk home took computer credit card cant go cant see friend nearby cant anything enjoy life want stay discussion possible make want kill repeating every time talk friend care think looser piece shit stopped school want go city next week dont appartment anymore know convince pay rent one month time get job independent,21yo school family hate alcooholic,riva x,2042,47,riva x 21yo french garbage parent made go engineering school far home paris 3 year preparatory math physic immediatly hated school entreprise visit class knew didnt want engineer rather kill becoming one engislave made really good friend city tho even going school anymore one point wa still happy told parent wanted stop engineering school wanted get job next year go study something always dreamt becoming doctor went back home holiday 3 week ago rough background story parent always conflict last summer always solved conflict hitting insulting saying horrible thing made hate make sleep outside day wa still good student preparatory class made bleed several time dad sharped stick wood mom nail told wanted get job city wa studying far home could near friend told home wa torture wa making go insane suicidal still home rn job still want go live city friend girlfriend life get job nobody talk home took computer credit card cant go cant see friend nearby cant anything enjoy life want stay discussion possible make want kill repeating every time talk friend care think looser piece shit stopped school want go city next week dont appartment anymore know convince pay rent one month time get job independent 21yo school family hate alcooholic

I want to tell my story. I want to be understood. I want to be remembered. Death is stalking us. Suicide or covid-19.  Car wreck  or cancer. Go out in a blaze or just simply die in  your sleep.   


I have suicidal ideations but i'm not sure if they are real or that it is just I see death  stalking me. Why kill myself?  No need.  Death is using the clues that i leave everywhere so that it can find me. 

&amp;#x200B;

It is blind. Death is blind. It just creeps around touching and feeling things until it finds it's prey and then it simply  taps you on the shoulder. Your left shoulder. Then it will whisper it's secret to you.  When you know death's secret, then you are dead. Everything beyond that is a secret.  It is the only secret in the history of the world that has ever been truly kept.    


The dead unswervingly serve their master.  No secrets told .  Death cannot be betrayed.  It cradled you before you born and  will hold you once again when you die. 

It isn't evil. It just IS. Everything just IS. 

I hope i am brave when I  finally feel that tap on my shoulder.  I want to greet death like an old friend because it is.  Death is our mother. It loves us unconditionally and will deny no one of it's love.  Oblivion is just fancy word eternal peace.   


We all want peace.  We want the  vibrations to subside and   when  the blur finally stops , we are left   with the secret we were told.  That secret that tells itself.     It wasn't such a  secret after all.

Anyone who wanna talk about it?," 

I am sorry for any error, english not my first language and I'm very anxious right now. It's a long story and it's kind of confusing, but here we go.

I am depressed since ever, I don't know when it started or how it started, the only thing that I know is that I am depressed since I was a kid and things is getting worse and worse. I was in big crisis in the last two years, life was not what I was expecting to be and things are so complicated, I tried, tried and I am still being fucked by things. So my cousin lives in another country and I asked her if I could stay with her for 3 months until things get better and I can organize myself to live here. So I moved here one month ago and I am trying to build things to live here. Maybe another country, another life maybe things get better, I don't know, I am trying.  
When I asked her if I can stay in her home she was really kind and supportive, it was in august/2019. Then I got here last month and she isn't nice at all. She wakes me up on purpose, she says bad things like ""I can watch my tv cause you are sleeping on the couch"" (the couch is ""my bed"" now). She insinuated that I should find a place for me since the day I arrived here. I try the most to help with things, I clean the house, I wash her clothes, I go the supermarket, I buy the food, I cook the food, I try to be outside the most so I give her a space. And still she's acting bad towards me. I don't know what to do since I asked her to be here for 3 months and after one month things are bad like this. The thing is that I feel so lonely right now and then I tried to talk with her yesterday and she was so mean, she say things like ""people are lonely"", ""grow up that life is hard"", ""cut off this depressed shit"" and others things really mean. The she got out and get really really really drunk with her friends and when she got home, she was another person, she was fun, making jokes, making me laugh, we watch a movie together and I was so fucked up with all the shit that I didn't sleep at all this night. Then she wakes up and starting a argument with me cause the dishes are dirty, but it was her, she used this last night when she was drunk, I tried to talk with her and she just said something like ""I hate that you here"". Now I am really confused. I know that I am not the asshole at all, but will I be the asshole if I kill myself now? I don't wanna kill myself because of her, I just wanna end it all cause I am so full of this shitty life.

I want to die because I am actually useless,"I got no talent whatsoever. I got nothing I want to do. I tried hard to search for what I can do and what I'm good at, just to find out I'm actually hopeless. That I have no fucking talent whatsoever. No motivation for anything as well. I'm a huge disappointment to everyone around me and it hurts. I love my friends and family, I want them to be proud of me, but there is nothing about me to be proud of. Until recently, I have tried my best with everything. Studying, socializing, classes I was taking, everything. I had the motivation of making my parents and friends proud. Of being a useful human being so they can love me. So I can be loveable. I lost that motivation recently. When my parents said that I am not good enough, said my younger sister is better than me and laughed. I got pissed and told them I was trying my best and they told me that I wasn't and that my result grades were the evidence. (I got 2 B's in math and social studies by 0.1 and 0.2 difference each, otherwise all A)They called me dumb and that they regret spending so much money on me if I was going to be this way, not working hard and not getting the best results. They said that I was acting depressed for no reason and I am whining about my life because I am spoiled. To break me completely my father said he is losing motivation to go to work and earn money because I am wasting it. Then my mother said I disappoint her. It is my fault that I couldn't get straight As on everything and I admit that I could have done better if I pushed myself harder, I admit that I should have done that but those words did hurt a lot for me. At that point, I still wanted to impress my friends but then my parents told me they won't want to hang out with me if I keep this up and continue being dumb, useless and not helpful. That made me feel like every effort I'm making is useless. Nobody ever told me I was doing a good job, my parents didn't compliment me whatsoever. I am done. I was diagnosed with depression and even then my parents never took me seriously saying that I lied. I want to be a loveable person and be loved. These days I have no motivation to do anything. I just want to die. May sound like I am whining, but my parent's validation were all I want and what I lived for until now. I don't know what to do and I dont even know what I am writing here but I just really, really want to die, disappear so my parents dont have to waste their hard earn money on me anymore, and could support my talented younger sister instead. I hope they could use the money to go on vacations and do something useful, instead of wasting it on me. I am a burden to people around me and I hate it.

Does anyone feel like the Universe has chosen you especially to make you suffer?,"First of all, sorry... I’m Brazilian and my english is broken.

I'm 26 years old, I think I'm beautiful and I look younger, but I've been in severe depression for over ten years because of family losses and my borderline disorder, and I think I was born mentally ill. I was hospitalized in 2016 and 2017 and under psychiatric treatment, but I think that I have no cure. 

I stopped going to university, I stopped working, everything goes wrong, but last year I thought everything was going to change. I met someone and helped him, gave him house, food, love and my family accepted him, but he made it worse, made me go through hell, left me at the rock bottom, and then this year he left, he left me!! Now he is living a happy life and I that helped him.. well I’m living in chaos. 

THAT'S NOT FAIR!  WHY EVERYTHING GOES WRONG IN MY LIFE?

Maybe its for the best that I don't live anymore,"I am almost 40, on disability morbidly obese and can't lose weight no matter how hard I try.   I am almost 40, with nothing but a 500 dollar laptop that my neighbor gave me that is falling apart and only worth around 70 if that. a pair of shoes that are falling apart and hurt when I walk in them. about a dozen worn-out socks and a few shirts and pants all black. mostly sweat pants and two pairs of blue jeans and a worn-out wallet that is falling apart on me. 

I am on disability getting less than 800$ USD a month and have no educational background no GED was homeless for over 8 years and have bad teeth because of it. some need fixing and one needs a new crown. I wasn't taught dental hygiene until I became homeless and even then brushing and flossing was the least of my worries. it was more of getting food and trying to survive. 

I spent the past few years trying to get my GED and failed even with tutors and teachers and study groups found out I have learning issues that make it hard for me to get my GED and I basically have to go from the 2nd and 3rd grade to 12th grade in every subject.

I have no family, no friends. I am utterly alone in this world. Bought a car two years ago was my first car and was planning on living in it but got scammed out of 3k. been trying to save again for another car to live in but been unable to. 

Renting a bedroom from an elderly woman with bad health and she is going in for surgery today if she doesn't make it I will be homeless again nowhere to live and unable to survive being homeless this time. My body has arthritis in my lower back, rheumatoid arthritis in my knees and feet. there's days that I just can't get out of bed because of it hurting so badly. there is no way I can survive being on the streets again.

I feel like complete and utter crap especially compared to everyone else and now realizing how worthless I am in life and maybe it is for the best I just don't live anymore. I have nothing in this world to live for other than myself and even then I don't care to do that anymore. nothing in my life will get better. 

I applied for HUD housing and was supposed to move into my own apartment after 7 years of waiting on the list for over 40 hud housing I got accepted to one but I couldn't make it there as I had no money to get there or for first months rent, downpayment, or to have the lights turned on. 

I spent the past ten years trying to better my life but only to get knocked down every time I get up. For example. saved 3 to 4 years up to 3k and bought my first car then got scammed by the dealership. Resaved money up to 900 dollars then needed two teeth pulled which cost 450 each after tax which drained my 900 I had saved last month after almost a year of saving. Then I got called up for my first apartment ever and couldn't get there. 

Two years ago needed eye surgery to remove a cataract in my right eye and now need it done in my left eye but the Dr refuses and now Texas is doing this Real ID stuff where you need a star on your driver license and in order to do that I need an eye exam and I will most likely fail it and lose my driver license because of the cataract in my left eye so there goes the driver license and there goes getting a car to live in. 

Spent years trying to get my GED only to fail it every time I try. spent the past eight years in the dating scene only to get rejected by women over my weight and told I am worthless and have nothing to offer a relationship or just downright mocked at and laughed at over my weight.

I got the cataracts in my eyes from taking Androgel testosterone medication because I have very low testosterone and I am on thyroid meds because my thyroid is basically dead and when they gave the max dose I lost 45 lbs in 8 months with absolutely no changes to my diet or daily routine but then gained it back a year later..

I just literally can't take anymore of this crummy life and to the point of thinking death is a lot better than this and it is better to be dead than keep failing or being knocked down every time I try to do something with my life. 

I also suffer from CPTSD = Complex post traumatic Stress Disorder. I didn't serve just from things I been through in my life and childhood. I also suffer from Severe chronic depression, Severe social anxiety, severe abandonment issues, paranoia and learning issues. I have been diagnosed with them all. 

I have looked up issues with autism and self diagnosing that I may be borderline autistic as I have some of the same issues in that spectrum. I am just so tired of fighting and so tired of going through life like this barely being able to breath and barely being able to survive and have absolutely nothing to show for

What the fuck am I still doing here?,"So... I've wanted to kill myself for the longest. I've even made several failed attempts. I've prayed to God for death. For Him to take me in my sleep. And every morning after that, when I wake up, I cried because I still exist. I have grown to ultimately hate myself. I feel like the most trash ass human being...

When I try to express this to other people, it will either be met with the ""tough love"" reprimand, or I end up pushing that person away because of my negative energy.

I don't even know myself anymore. I don't have any more passion for things I once did (cooking, massage therapy). I attempt to develop motivation, but my depression and anxiety will team up with the PTSD I incurred from being robbed. When I notice negative self-talk, I'll try to change my thought patterns, but it always ends up back at ""The world would be better off if you were gone."" But I'm too much of a coward to try and take myself out again...

I just want to be happy, man. I want to be who I was before I figured out I was raised in CPS, who I was before being orphaned, who I was before being the state's property and another statistic.

Actually sat down to write the note....,"I've had SI since I was like 8 years old, and I'm 34 now. I've thought many times about what I would put in the note, who I would address it to. Would I write multiple messages, or only one? 

Tonight I actually opened up wordpad and started composing it. I'm just so tired. I'm so tired of feeling like every day is a fight just to exist. I'm so tired of fighting self-destructive impulses and not winning, I'm so tired of feeling guilty because I'm using up the Earth's resources. 

I *know* my husband would be a happier person if I'd just grabbed some balls and taken care of this years ago. He could find someone who actually contributes to his happiness instead of having to support me through my never-ending nonsense. I stood in the way of his chance to establish a new relationship a few years ago. I should have just packed my things and gotten out of his way, but I was selfish. I'm so fucking selfish. If I really loved him I would have let him go to find happiness, instead of expressing my own emotions and selfishness and guilting him into staying with me.

I'm aware that I'm not adequately considering his agency in this evaluation, but I'm also aware of his background. Religious guilt, familial obligation, he's the one who wanted to get married, etc will all contribute to his feeling of responsibility. 

I've almost posted here so many times, but I've always talked myself out of it in the past. I'm not calling a hotline and taking up resources from someone who might actually benefit from them.

I'm also too chickenshit to actually do anything about it. I'm terrified to wind up locked up again (have done a stint in a psych ward at 18 and being strip searched is not something I'd ever wish on ANYONE). I just know I'd fuck it up somehow and not actually complete killing myself, and then I'd be stuck even more miserable.

I don't really know where to begin but suicide is something I have been thinking about constantly. I don't want to wake up, I don't want to be anywhere or with anyone, and I don't even want to sleep anymore and that's the only thing that would numb my depression (because I wasn't awake to feel it). I feel so incredibly lost and I can't help but to want so badly to end it all. I keep wishing something would push me over the edge enough to give me the strength to finally kill myself. Everything's just so dark and honestly I could go on forever but my brother-in-law just walked in and I have to pretend like I'm okay again so I guess I'll stop there.

I suffocate 24/7 and wake up constantly throughout the night - Empty Nose Syndrome!?," 

I had an open cosmetic rhinoplasty 4 months ago and since then I've been experiencing symptoms that have been fairly debilitating for me. A few weeks post-op I noticed that my air flow was different in each nostril and there was a slight pain in my left but I chalked it up to swelling.  

Now, 4 months later there is no more pain but I feel like there is a blockage in my left nostril and I can't sense airflow at all in either nostril which is keeping me up at night.  

I'm on sleeping pills which is barely helping me get a few hours throughout the night. I'm really scared and did not expect to go through this scary journey - all I wanted was a refinement. How would I know if I have empty nose syndrome or if I should wait longer to see if my issues are resolved naturally? 

Please help anyone who has gone through something similar or knows someone who has gotten better as I've become a shell of myself.. going from perfect breathing to feeling like I'm walking around with a bag over my head all day is devastating and the real kicker is I'm not even happy with the cosmetic result but at this point I just want to breathe again,,,",amymarie1996,7,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/feb96w/i_suffocate_247_and_wake_up_constantly_throughout/,open cosmetic rhinoplasty 4 month ago since experiencing symptom fairly debilitating week post op noticed air flow wa different nostril wa slight pain left chalked swelling 4 month later pain feel like blockage left nostril sense airflow either nostril keeping night sleeping pill barely helping get hour throughout night really scared expect go scary journey wanted wa refinement would know empty nose syndrome wait longer see issue resolved naturally please help anyone ha gone something similar know someone ha gotten better become shell going perfect breathing feeling like walking around bag head day devastating real kicker even happy cosmetic result point want breathe,suffocate 24 7 wake constantly throughout night empty nose syndrome,amy marie 1996,1146,84,amy marie 1996 open cosmetic rhinoplasty 4 month ago since experiencing symptom fairly debilitating week post op noticed air flow wa different nostril wa slight pain left chalked swelling 4 month later pain feel like blockage left nostril sense airflow either nostril keeping night sleeping pill barely helping get hour throughout night really scared expect go scary journey wanted wa refinement would know empty nose syndrome wait longer see issue resolved naturally please help anyone ha gone something similar know someone ha gotten better become shell going perfect breathing feeling like walking around bag head day devastating real kicker even happy cosmetic result point want breathe suffocate 24 7 wake constantly throughout night empty nose syndrome

Feeling empty,"It's not that I hate working but... no, it is precisely that I hate working. I just can't come to terms with the thought that I'm going to waste a huge part of my life doing things I don't like to do. 
For what? I don't see the point on working hard and achieving all these career goals if the only time I'm going to have to myself would be after I retire — IF I'm ever going to retire and not just drop dead in my 50/60s. 
I'm 27 and I have no idea how to live this life, my supposedly only chance at sentience. I'm depressed due to a lot of things: physical health problems, not being able to find a job that I'm going to at least tolerate, feeling generally lost in life.
I hated all the jobs I've been at, ALL OF THEM. It majorly contributed to my suicidal tendencies and I quit my last job with this awful premonition that if I'm not going to quit asap, I'm going to kill myself. 
My family doesn't understand because 'Everybody's gotta work for a living' (the usual), they kind of resent me now for being like this. I'd gladly drink all the Kool-Aid of this world and be a relatively happy working drone at this point in my life, but my mind just isnt wired that way.
I'm tired of constantly feeling depressed, guilty, angry at this world and myself. I feel absolutely alone, even thought I know that I'm not alone in this type of thinking.
Right now I just feel empty, like there's no way out of this, lile I have nothing to live for.

I’m Having A Hard Time,"I took a benzo a little bit ago, so I’m not that freaked out right now, but today has been really, really hard. I don’t usually feel such utter despair, but it’s been creeping in and getting stronger by the day. I’m physically fine, and I can see a future that’s better than what I have now, but I don’t see it as worth living. Wage slavery at the bottom of the totem pole for another 30 years, no forms or loved ones outside my immediate family, no accomplishments or achievements. Just the long, slow decline into a sad, lonely old age, followed by a meaningless, protracted, lonely  senescence. No one will care for me as an old man, because I’m incapable of caring for people now. I’m doomed to mediocrity and loneliness. Nothing can keep it from happening except ending it all before it gets to that point. I keep thinking ‘Well, I could try and off myself, that would keep things interesting and I could put off that fate for just a little longer.’ But no.

I just want the sadness to stop,"I don't think I enjoy life.

I enjoy the moments most, where I either distract or numb myself from most of what's happening around me, like when I play videogames, stay up late, wake up late, over and undereat or get myself drunk. 

I've felt like this for so long, I just don't want to suffer.

I want to redo and right all the things that I wronged
All the people I've hurt, all the relationships that I broke. 

I know I don't get a second chance at all that and neither can I fix what's wrong with me, why I can't feel happy, joyful and innocent.

Germany just allowed doctor assisted suicide and I want to reach out to end it.

I Don't Know Why I've Been Thinking About Suicide So Much Lately..,"I know I'm not gonna kill myself, but that doesn't distract me from the fact that I want to. Over these past few weeks, my suicidal thoughts from last year had resurged.. I feel like an absolute failure; an absolute burden to those around me. Every day, whenever I hear someone laugh, I instantly feel as if they're making fun of me. I feel like nobody really likes me... as if all my relationships are fake with others. When people make fun of me, I just let it happen. I either laugh along or smile like a fucking idiot because I don't want to cause any more problems for the person. I feel as if each time I say something, I ruin someone's day. Just today, I said something I shouldn't have... and now I feel like absolute shit even though I apologized after realizing how shitty it was for me to ask that. I don't think he accepted my apology anyways. My grades aren't bad by any means, I have B's and A's in hard classes, but I feel like I'm just crunching under the pressure. My parents hate my grades and all my friends around me seem to just be doing much better than me. I really just think I'm a failure and will never do good in life. I feel like people hate me and view me as a burden. Each time I try something, I never turn out to be good at it. I feel as if I'm bad, or simply average, at whatever I do. I'm not creative, musical or smart. Do I really deserve existing if I can't make a single difference in this world?

&amp;#x200B;

Sometimes the self blame and guilt get so immense and overwhelming and I want to go, too. Sometimes I'm terrified that if it was really my fault, it would come bite me in the ass one day. That thought intensifies the urges to tap out, because I think it would take the blame with me.

It also scares me whenever I remember that analogy about glasses being full, and what if this is how my glass spills over? How do I empty my glass?

"getting bullied for painful crippling disease, going to gun stores regularly","When I was in the 10th grade I started to lose my memory and developed painful symptoms in my limbs, I immediately knew it was extremely serious and possibly terminal. Every few months I would get more sick and it has remained that way for the past 6 years I have been getting worse every few months.

My disease has become so severe that I cannot continue school or study from cognitive impairment, I can barely eat anything without getting pain and it is impossible to gain any weight.I can barely walk outside because of shortness of breath, I cannot leave the house in the summer.the disease is extremely painful and disabling every day is a battle with pain, and controlling symptoms.

several doctors have diagnosed me with a neurological disease which they say is untreatable and not curable.

so for the past few weeks I have been visiting gun shops while I lie to my parents and tell them I am going to the gym.

everyone treats me like crap especially my parents.

my body has reached its physical limits, I cannot endure any more pain from the disease it is impossible, so I am going to buy guns and kill myself.",HugeIndication1,37,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/fdlq8w/getting_bullied_for_painful_crippling_disease/,wa 10th grade started lose memory developed painful symptom limb immediately knew wa extremely serious possibly terminal every month would get sick ha remained way past 6 year getting worse every month disease ha become severe cannot continue school study cognitive impairment barely eat anything without getting pain impossible gain weight barely walk outside shortness breath cannot leave house summer disease extremely painful disabling every day battle pain controlling symptom several doctor diagnosed neurological disease say untreatable curable past week visiting gun shop lie parent tell going gym everyone treat like crap especially parent body ha reached physical limit cannot endure pain disease impossible going buy gun kill,getting bullied painful crippling disease going gun store regularly,huge indication 1,1123,76,huge indication 1 wa 10th grade started lose memory developed painful symptom limb immediately knew wa extremely serious possibly terminal every month would get sick ha remained way past 6 year getting worse every month disease ha become severe cannot continue school study cognitive impairment barely eat anything without getting pain impossible gain weight barely walk outside shortness breath cannot leave house summer disease extremely painful disabling every day battle pain controlling symptom several doctor diagnosed neurological disease say untreatable curable past week visiting gun shop lie parent tell going gym everyone treat like crap especially parent body ha reached physical limit cannot endure pain disease impossible going buy gun kill getting bullied painful crippling disease going gun store regularly

"Well, here we are","21. University student. Stressed to the max with zero support system whatsoever. I was homeless before college (and in college) and moved across the country right after high school, cutting off contact with my abusive family. Been suicidal most of the time since being in college and in high school but still here. Came out and got a girlfriend, still nothing got better. We were homeless together for a while and experienced a lot together, been with each other for over two years. She’s an alcoholic though and because it’s a progressive disease things got worse over time and began to hit a low October/November 2019. Anyone who’s got experience with an alcoholic loved one knows how awful it gets. I never thought things could get so much worse, but then I never thought I’d be a suicidally depressed 21 year old and I also never thought I’d date an alcoholic. It has a way of destroying your soul unlike anything else you’ll ever experience, and I’ve been abused since I was an infant. I put aside my own sense of self, my own needs and well being to focus on hers while my heart got ripped out, stomped on, and spat on repeatedly. I’ve been thinking about offing myself for a very long time. I don’t see an end to the suffering I’ve experienced in my lifetime. My girlfriend started her journey with sobriety two weeks ago (at least I believe, don’t know what to really think these days) and it feels like while she’s making leaps and bounds with things I begged her to do for months I’m stuck behind and can’t get my mind out of the gutter from when things were really, really bad. I know things take time but I’m tired of waiting for when life gets “good”. I used to think happiness was a personal choice and I still believe that a little bit, but with all the garbage I’ve experienced in my 21 years I’m mostly just of the opinion that some of us are dealt horrible hands in life and doomed from the start. While I “have” people in my life who care about me I will never have the kind of person who cares about and supports others to the extent that I do. And maybe that’s a good thing, because doing so has made me lose everything about myself. But now my glass is empty and there’s nothing to pour into it. I’m tired of struggling every day. Suicide seems like the only way off this terrible ride for me and it has felt that way for years.",forest_lesbian,2,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/fe9vg9/well_here_we_are/,21 university student stressed max zero support system whatsoever wa homeless college college moved across country right high school cutting contact abusive family suicidal time since college high school still came got girlfriend still nothing got better homeless together experienced lot together two year alcoholic though progressive disease thing got worse time began hit low october november 2019 anyone got experience alcoholic loved one know awful get never thought thing could get much worse never thought suicidally depressed 21 year old also never thought date alcoholic ha way destroying soul unlike anything else ever experience abused since wa infant put aside sense self need well focus heart got ripped stomped spat repeatedly thinking offing long time see end suffering experienced lifetime girlfriend started journey sobriety two week ago least believe know really think day feel like making leap bound thing begged month stuck behind get mind gutter thing really really bad know thing take time tired waiting life get good used think happiness wa personal choice still believe little bit garbage experienced 21 year mostly opinion u dealt horrible hand life doomed start people life care never kind person care support others extent maybe good thing ha made lose everything glass empty nothing pour tired struggling every day suicide seems like way terrible ride ha felt way year,well,forest lesbian,2350,17,forest lesbian 21 university student stressed max zero support system whatsoever wa homeless college college moved across country right high school cutting contact abusive family suicidal time since college high school still came got girlfriend still nothing got better homeless together experienced lot together two year alcoholic though progressive disease thing got worse time began hit low october november 2019 anyone got experience alcoholic loved one know awful get never thought thing could get much worse never thought suicidally depressed 21 year old also never thought date alcoholic ha way destroying soul unlike anything else ever experience abused since wa infant put aside sense self need well focus heart got ripped stomped spat repeatedly thinking offing long time see end suffering experienced lifetime girlfriend started journey sobriety two week ago least believe know really think day feel like making leap bound thing begged month stuck behind get mind gutter thing really really bad know thing take time tired waiting life get good used think happiness wa personal choice still believe little bit garbage experienced 21 year mostly opinion u dealt horrible hand life doomed start people life care never kind person care support others extent maybe good thing ha made lose everything glass empty nothing pour tired struggling every day suicide seems like way terrible ride ha felt way year well
I'm so ugly I want to fucking end it!,"I'm 24  and still have terrible acne. I used to not hate the way i looked up until high school, but then I got hit with the acne. Huge cystic acne that left scars all over my face and is super painful. I used to look at myself in high school the mirror and say "" I hate myself and want to die"" as a mantra. I was holding onto the hope that it was just a teenage phase, and that I would get on with my life after. Now its been years and years and I still get new zits and cysts every day. It's painful, and they pop and bleed everywhere. I've tried all of the acne treatments except accutaine which my doctor recommended against for reasons in my medical history. To offset the acne I grew my hair long and made it my main feature to distract from the disgusting acne. It became such a large part of my personality that all my friends at the time called me goldilocks. 

Then recently ago I started balding really quickly. My hairline is going way back, and I'm starting to lose hair on my crown. Looking at old pictures of my dad it's all gonna be gone in a few years. I can't stand to look at myself in the mirror. My face is red and pocked and covered in acne and the one and only thing that I liked about my appearance is slowly falling away. I'm some sort of freakish middle age man/ greasy teen hybrid. I used to have moderate luck is the relationship department back when I had my hair, but noone will even look at me now. My hair was the only thing I was ever complimented on. Now I'm treated like some monster that noone wants in their pictures or their life. 

I've been trying to not off myself for a while now. My family would be devastated and that's the only thing that is keeping me from doing it. My brother is getting his firearms licence and wanted me to come with him, but I had to refuse, because I know if I had a weapon it would just be a matter of time. What can be done to make the pain stop.

My entire life has hit the reset button and I’ve entirely given up hope,"This is quite the long story but i just needed to vent. 

TW: drug use

September 9th Of 2018 was the worst day of my life, on that day my father had passed away unexpectedly from a blood clot in his lung that the doctors knew about but never put him on medication for. That day, my entire life had changed and since then I haven’t been able to recover. While yes I was depressed much before this and had been struggling with suicidal thoughts and tendencies since I was 8, my father death had made it all so much worse. I had started to get on anti-depressants, get counseling, and come out to my mother as trans not long after this because she had discovered I was trans. None of these treatments helped much until late November after I had attempted suicide and realized how cared for I was by family that had visited me in the hospital, then I really started to work hard for them to get better and to make sure I could get to the day when I could start hormone replacement therapy in about a year. Not long after that incident I traveled to New Mexico to visit family and my mom fell in love with a hole here and felt the need to reconnect with the family that lived there so she had decided to buy a home here and make my family move, which I can’t fully blame her for wanting to get out of the state we lived in (ny), it reminded her too much of my dad. When I first heard this news I was depressed about it but slowly become more accepting as I got much happier and healthier. I got to a point where I no longer felt the need for medication and cut back on therapy before moving to New Mexico, but those months of hard work all crashed when I got here. When I moved I had honestly lost everything I had known and have been stuck with a family of alcoholics who always start stupid drama over small things. I feel as if I can’t even do anything without someone starting shit about something I’ve done when I’m around them. But anyways soon enough I start school, I’m fairly excited about it but quickly that excitement dies out and is replaced with absolute misery. The school I currently go to refuses to let me use the mens bathroom and makes me use the women’s one because of my biological sex, keeps all of my accounts and name on the attendance as my birth name despite the fact I don’t identify with it, and dress coded me for piercings and dyed hair which they had never mentioned would be a problem when I went to register for the school not even a week before the school year started. So on my first day I get dress coded for things I was never warned about and told I had signed a paper that states I fully read through the dress code and agreed to comply with it (which I had actually gotten two weeks later during school hours). Bullshit, right? Well it gets worse. The only kid willing to talk to me was a drug addict who had done cocaine in front of me and offered me some, while high he almost choked himself to death and chucked a desk at the girls in front of us which was quite fucking terrifying. Almost a month after this event the same kid breaks my pencil sharpener and takes the blade part out of it, leaving the class shortly after to go to the bathroom. Of course I tell the teacher and she gets the counselor to get him, and he gets sent to a mental hospital for a week or so and transfers schools. So while yes, he may have been an absolute crackhead he was still the only friend I had so I was very bummed out and felt alone. Months pass and I feel more and more depressed as days go by, I start contemplating suicide once again and try to get my mom to get me a therapist (which she still hasn’t done). And of course on top of all of this kids at school find out I’m transgender and I’ve been getting dead named, picked on, and asked extremely personal questions  since then. Because of this discovery made by my classmates I’ve started to also gotten rape threats and death threats in which I feel there’s no point in reporting since the school cannot even comply by the laws and let me use the bathroom I feel comfortable in. Well I have started to make friends I still feel all alone and hopeless for things to get any better for my life, I’ve been trying so hard to get my life back into shape and actually gave loving here my best shot but I’ve failed myself and been failed by so many others, I see no point in continuing on since things keep getting worse and I’m not sure if I can hold on that much longer. The only reason I’m still here is because I know there’s people that care and I don’t want to put them through the same pain I went through when I lost my dad.",Throwaway12034056078,0,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/fe9qvi/my_entire_life_has_hit_the_reset_button_and_ive/,quite long story needed vent tw drug use september 9th 2018 wa

How many of us are here because of sexual abuse?,"So many people have experienced it, and so many more *don't even realize* that they have. We were too young to remember, or we think that one thing that happened doesn't count, or we are in denial that that's what it truly was. But our body remembers. Our bodies and our souls, they carry the heaviness of the pain that we can never seem to put down. I believe that most of the times people want to end their lives, even if they are doing it slowly through addictions or passive behaviors, it's for this reason. 

Whether we were manipulated, tricked, forced, brutalized, lied to, used and discarded... all of these actions cut deep, to the very core of our being, and it feels like there's no way to ever move past them. When there's nothing else to distract us, the weight is unbearable.",GereniumLeaf,12,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/fdt5ui/how_many_of_us_are_here_because_of_sexual_abuse/,many people experienced many even realize young remember think one thing happened count denial truly wa body remembers body soul carry heaviness pain never seem put believe time people want end life even slowly addiction passive behavior reason whether manipulated tricked forced brutalized lied used discarded action cut deep core feel like way ever move past nothing else distract u weight unbearable,many u sexual abuse,geren um leaf,789,48,geren um leaf many people experienced many even realize young remember think one thing happened count denial truly wa body remembers body soul carry heaviness pain never seem put believe time people want end life even slowly addiction passive behavior reason whether manipulated tricked forced brutalized lied used discarded action cut deep core feel like way ever move past nothing else distract u weight unbearable many u sexual abuse
i find comfort in the object i wanna harm myself with.,"today was really rough for me, as i've struggled with my gender identity for almost 2 years now. my boyfriend says that he'll love me no matter what, even if i decide i'm happier as a girl instead of a boy like i've convinced myself. we're both trans and afab, but i'm having my doubts. he told me today that he'd never leave me, but that only made my depression spiral back down. i've talked to him, and he told me all these coping mechanisms, but they never work.
my one ""coping mechanism"" is having the knowledge of the thing i want to hurt myself with is within my reach. i have a utility knife that i wanna use for my own safety in college, but for now i really wanna cut myself with it.
i'm scared to try and kms again, but when i tried to open up to my family about being trans, they tell me that i haven't given it enough thought and that i don't know what i want (i'm 17 and have known i hated being a girl since i hit puberty at 10).

My mom told me to kill myself,"She was yelling at me about school stuff in the car. I usually stay calm and let her get it out of her system but today I snapped and told her that I’m suicidal, hoping that she’d calm down. She did not. She belittled me for it while I tried to keep myself from crying too much. I tried again, telling her that I want to kill myself and asking if that’s what she wants. Her immediate response was “You know what? Do what you fucking want.” 

I’m so tired. I’m sixteen, this isn’t normal. I defend her at every turn, even now in group chats with friends calling her abusive while I’m sleeping over at a friend’s house because the thought of returning home makes me feel like I’m gonna puke. 
I had a vivid image of my dead body covered in blood with a note saying that line of hers and a smiley face. I also want to see the look on her face when I walk up to her with a knife in my hand and tear my wrists open. I want to damage her as much as she’s damaged me. 

I’m not as depressed as I normally am, surprisingly. Just tired. She came by with a bag of extra clothes for me and I think she found an empty pack of cigarettes in my closet because she took a shirt of mine that was under it (I hide it between layers). My friend went out to get it for me because thinking about talking to her face to face made me anxious. She blamed him, to his face, for me wanting to switch schools; that he scared me out of my current program. 

I’m not actually going to kill myself or anything, as much as I want to. It’s too short notice for me to make any final preparations. But I think if I hadn’t called my friend I’d have broken my self harm clean streak and cut down to the dermis again or maybe even deeper. 

The icing on the cake for all this is that I got called selfish by my mom for not coming home. Her boyfriend’s mother passed away recently (we live with him) and her funeral is tomorrow. I have selfish timing apparently, and I’m not even the one who started this whole thing in the first place. I’ve cried so much that I don’t feel any strong emotions anymore. All I have right now is sadness, but it almost fades into me being tired. 

I also have guilt. Not because of this but because I have an important group project due tomorrow and I was supposed to make a poster. I obviously wasn’t able to complete it. People’s grades are going to suffer because I’m too weak to just walk inside the appartment and sit through some yelling     

I just don’t deserve to live, I guess. I’m a massive letdown to everyone in one way or another. People would be much happier with me gone, my parents are divorced and though my dad would be upset about losing me at least he won’t have to put up with my melodrama anymore. My mom won’t have to stress herself out over me being too tired to put effort into school, there wouldn’t be any strain on her relationship with her boyfriend anymore because of me. My classmates won’t have to worry about bad grades because of a flakey group member. My boyfriend can get someone who won’t ruin his mood all the time just by talking about their feelings. My family doesn’t have to worry about me being a disgrace or anything, if a member dies by suicide they’ll likely just get pity rather than dirty looks after I inevitably become a junkie. 

The only one I would really feel bad for is my dog. I don’t see him often, every few months or so. But he loves me about as much as I love him. I don’t know how I could ever explain to him, in a way that he’ll understand, why I’m leaving and not coming back. Why it’s not his fault, the extent of how much I love him, how good of a boy he is. That’s just something I’ll never be able to do for him. 

Vent over. I need to get some sleep but I don’t think I’ll be able to get up in the morning. 

If it’s any consolation, to those that have read this far, I’m seeing my psychologist tomorrow.",witch_image,2,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/fe4x5d/my_mom_told_me_to_kill_myself/,wa yelling school stuff car usually stay calm let get system today snapped told suicidal hoping calm belittled tried keep cry much tried telling want kill asking want immediate response wa know fucking want tired sixteen normal defend every turn even group chat friend calling abusive sleeping friend house thought returning home make feel like gonna puke vivid image dead body covered blood note saying line smiley face also want see look face walk knife hand tear wrist open want damage much damaged depressed normally surprisingly tired came bag extra clothes think found empty pack cigarette closet took shirt mine wa hide layer friend went get thinking talking face face made anxious blamed face wanting switch school scared current program actually going kill anything much want short notice make final preparation think called friend broken self harm clean streak cut dermis maybe even deeper icing cake got called selfish mom coming home boyfriend mother passed away recently live funeral tomorrow selfish timing apparently even one started whole thing first place cried much feel strong emotion anymore right sadness almost fade tired also guilt important group project due tomorrow wa supposed make poster obviously able complete people grade going suffer weak walk inside appartment sit yelling deserve live guess massive letdown everyone one way another people would much happier gone parent divorced though dad would upset losing least put melodrama anymore mom stress tired put effort school strain relationship boyfriend anymore classmate worry bad grade flakey group member boyfriend get someone ruin mood time talking feeling family worry disgrace anything member dy suicide likely get pity rather dirty look inevitably become junkie one would really feel bad dog see often every month love much love know could ever explain way understand leaving coming back fault extent much love good boy something never able vent need get sleep think able get morning consolation read far seeing psychologist tomorrow,mom told kill,witch image,3868,29,witch image wa yelling school stuff car usually stay calm let get system today snapped told suicidal hoping calm belittled tried keep cry much tried telling want kill asking want immediate response wa know fucking want tired sixteen normal defend every turn even group chat friend calling abusive sleeping friend house thought returning home make feel like gonna puke vivid image dead body covered blood note saying line smiley face also want see look face walk knife hand tear wrist open want damage much damaged depressed normally surprisingly tired came bag extra clothes think found empty pack cigarette closet took shirt mine wa hide layer friend went get thinking talking face face made anxious blamed face wanting switch school scared current program actually going kill anything much want short notice make final preparation think called friend broken self harm clean streak cut dermis maybe even deeper icing cake got called selfish mom coming home boyfriend mother passed away recently live funeral tomorrow selfish timing apparently even one started whole thing first place cried much feel strong emotion anymore right sadness almost fade tired also guilt important group project due tomorrow wa supposed make poster obviously able complete people grade going suffer weak walk inside appartment sit yelling deserve live guess massive letdown everyone one way another people would much happier gone parent divorced though dad would upset losing least put melodrama anymore mom stress tired put effort school strain relationship boyfriend anymore classmate worry bad grade flakey group member boyfriend get someone ruin mood time talking feeling family worry disgrace anything member dy suicide likely get pity rather dirty look inevitably become junkie one would really feel bad dog see often every month love much love know could ever explain way understand leaving coming back fault extent much love good boy something never able vent need get sleep think able get morning consolation read far seeing psychologist tomorrow mom told kill

I’ll explain, I was enjoying some YouTube when I saw “Beautiful?” by illymations. It was a very triggering song for me and I sniped my skin after a year long clean streak ( if you’re confused because I’ve been gone for four months I didn’t cut in that time) and gained a handy dandy addiction. I used anything I could get my hands on, then one day my dog was biting me really hard and I went on the floor crying thinking about how everyone hates me even my dog. Then I really wanted to die every day. I have the same schedule every day, wake up and snooze till I make my lunch, I never eat breakfast, switch t-shirts, bike to school and say hi to the crossing guard, go to each class feeling like garbage and cutting in pe and English, biking home feeling like a failure, eating and being apathetic, doing my homework till I pass out (so like two pages in) waking up and doing more homework then going to bed at 2 then waking up and doing it all again.

I’ve made a decision,"At the end of March if things still aren’t better, I’m just gonna take the whole bottle of acetaminophen in the kitchen before school. If it doesn’t kill me, then my parents will know I’m suicidal, and if does then I’ll be dead! It’s a win-win either way.

I would stay home from school, but I feel like that would arouse suspicion. If I start feeling the effects around lunch and don’t want to go back to school so they don’t figure it out, then I’ll just drive to a Walmart parking lot or something.

Sure, I’ll be missing graduation and prom and all those super important high school things... but at this point I don’t care. I see no point in continuing to live.

I don't want to exist,"The summer of 2019 I started developing severe OCD after suffering from mild, unnoticeable OCD for many years. I just feel so tired of things, so bored of living, but I can't commit suicide.

I know that there are people who care about about me, like my parents, and the shit they would have to go trough if I commited suicide is unbearable for me to imagine.

But I just wished I didn't exist, that I never was born. I wish I could vanish from this world, be gone like the wind.

I often wish I would die in an accident or disease, because maybe that would be less painful for the people around me then if I would commit suicide.

I have stayed home from school for about 2 months because of illness related to the stress, not stress from school, but from my mental health. I feel crippled.

One day I woke up and was completely emotionally numb. I couldn't feel happiness, sadness, anger or any other emotion, but it got better. But I really wished it wouldn't have gotten better, it was ""amazing"", I couldn't either feel anxiety so all I felt was blank.

When I think about the meaning of life I always come to the conclusion that I want to marry a wonderful woman, have kids and grow old and die of old age, and this is the other thing keeping me alive.

Running Out of Time,"The method of suicide I selected is hypothermia. There's a river near my house with 40 degree water Fahrenheit, 4 degrees Celsius. Being in there at night, no one would see me. I would tie a rope to a life jacket and confine myself to a tree so I don't drift along the current to a spot where someone would find me. Death would occur within a couple of hours of being in the water, and unconsciousness would happen before then. This method is easy to pull off because it doesn't involve highly intense pain, and I can get out if I really want to.

The problem is that this isn't going to work soon, due to the warmer seasons approaching. I have to quickly decide if I want to die.

When I told people that they called me selfish. “People love you” “think about your kids” “if you do it I’ll never visit your grave”. Why would it take for me to die for people to start showing love for me? Honestly my kid will be better off without me. They don’t deserve to have such a fucked up mom. And I’m not being buried. I want to be cremated and thrown away. So I don’t really need visitors.

My life is worthless.,"Every day now for years, it's been exactly the same. Wake up, attend online school, get scolded by my teachers and parents for my poor grades and how slow I am, spend hours doing homework I struggle with, be overwhelmed and stressed about my life, cry and contemplate dying, go to bed, and repeat. On the weekends I'll either just sit in my room all day watching YouTube or nap all day because I can't even find the energy to get out of bed and  do anything. I can't even find the will to finish my homework. I don't enjoy anything anymore. I don't have any skills, talents, or interests, and I can't even get a job since I live in the middle of nowhere and I'm terrified of learning to drive. I don't even really know anything about the real world. I'm just a husk of a  person who rots in isolation in my room all day fantasizing about being dead.  I am so desperately alone and I feel like a absolute worthless moron. My entire life I've literally never even had one friend. Every time in the past when I was going to public school and tried to make friends with people I always fucked up and made myself look idiotic  because I never understood how to talk to people and form connections  with them. I can't even make online friends. No one cares about me, not even my own parents. 

I  just am so tired of trying to survive each day of hell by myself. I  don't see how life can get any better when I'm already incapable of  achieving anything. It doesn't help either that I'm so scared about the  future. I don't know what I want out of my life, and even if I did, I'd have no idea how to get there with how far I've fallen behind everyone else and how unmotivated I am. I'm scared of fucking my life up even more than I already have. Maybe it'd be easier at this point for me to just drown myself to prevent having a depressing future where I'm suffering even more.

Life isn’t worth it,"Failing half my classes, same as last semester, going to drop out of college at the end of the semester with no life direction, no ambition, no motivation, no desires, dreams, will to live.

Don’t really see a way out of this shitty life other than killing myself. Mom asked me a couple weeks ago where I see myself in 10 years. I told her I didn’t know, but all I could think was that I don’t see any scenario where I’m alive in 10 years. Might as well just off myself now before everything goes to shit... sorry... before everything gets even shittier just like it always does. Cutting my hand right now cause I know it won’t leave scars like are on my arm. Don’t even know why I’m writing this. Maybe I just need to rant or get this off my chest.

Death without pain.,I've been depressed and I seem to be getting increasingly depressed each day. I want to die so this can stop but I don't want to die because I know that it hurts and would cause my family pain (specifically my sister because I was the one who was able to talk her out mid-attempt and my father because when he was around my age he lost a close cousin to suicide). I want to know if there's any other ways of solving this because I'm aware of how final suicide is but I know if I try talking to someone about this in real life I will just say things to be considered fine so I don't have to cost my parents money for therapy.

[TW] I am 16 and have attempted suicide 4 times; bullying about my appearance is making me consider it again,"I generally steer clear of making posts of this nature since I don't like discussing my personal life on social media. That said, this is something that I feel I must be open about in order to come to terms with it. To contextualise, I'm a 16 year old girl and I'm originally from Eastern Europe, but I now live in the UK. This may be a very long read and I'll be sure to TL;DR.

I was diagnosed with autism at the age of 4. I'm not 'low functioning' (for lack of a better term; feel free to suggest one) per se, but to other people, it's pretty obvious that I am developmentally disabled. I have poor fine motor skills, struggle to articulate my thoughts and am extremely susceptible to meltdowns when not on birth control (I'll explain this later).

For most of my early childhood this was largely not a huge issue in my life. I received good support and people were usually empathetic towards my struggles. However, things started to go slowly and then eventually very dramatically downhill once I got my period age 10.

My parents noticed that I had menstrual cycles that were on average around 21 days in length. Initially, they weren't too worried and assumed they would eventually become more regular as time went on. They didn't. They became shorter, and when I last calculated them, my cycles lasted 18 days on average. This messed up my hormones and I became extremely depressed. This depression peaked around my period. I don't mean that I got typical premenstrual symptoms; in the days leading up to my period, I would self harm, have suicidal thoughts, experience very violent and dramatic mood swings, become extremely sensitive to sound and texture and lose interest in my hobbies and friends. I suggested possibly having PMDD but this idea was dismissed by my parents and doctors.

I first attempted suicide when I was either 13 or 14 (but definitely no older). I didn't inform my parents of this, but only because I didn't want to upset them or make them feel like they had failed me as parents, because they definitely didn't. I then attempted once more aged 15.

During this time period I was prescribed the combined oral contraceptive pill. Theoretically, I am supposed to 'tricycle' them, or in other words, take three months' worth of packs and then take a break. I did this until the second most recent attempt in October of last year. This was the first one that I told anybody about and you may not be shocked to hear that it happened whilst I was on a 'period break'. I went to A&amp;E the next day, where I waited for seven hours before being seen by a therapist for twenty minutes who told me that I seemed to have things 'under control' and took no action except refer me to another therapist, who I had one appointment with where I heard the same thing. It was my mother's birthday that day and I have not forgiven myself for making her spend it in A&amp;E. She stayed mostly collected throughout it all but I could tell she felt very upset and shaken. Since this, I have stopped taking breaks and now do not have periods at all. This is massively helpful but my situation is still not great.

It's partly for that reason that I didn't inform her of my most recent attempt in December. It was also because I was due to fly to Canada the day after the attempt and couldn't bring myself to jeopardise the trip. I considered calling a suicide hotline once I was in Montreal but ended up not doing it, mainly because when I looked up numbers to call, I couldn't find one in Quebec that offered English counselling, but also because my mother discouraged it because of what we would be charged (please remember, she didn't know that I had attempted suicide).

I'm in Year 11, which in the UK is the final year of high school. I'm currently caught up in revising for my GCSEs, which I'm doing OK with from an academic perspective, but struggling to cope with mentally. I'm also being bullied; less than in previous years but still in a way that fucks me up even though I pretend it doesn't. I used to be targeted for my personality and mannerisms, which I've given up being upset about since I've accepted that I don't carry myself typically. Recently, though, they've shifted to targeting my appearance.

This may make me sound shallow, but as a 16 year old girl, having my appearance mocked and scorned is completely crushing. A few months ago it was never something I gave much thought and I never felt insecure about my appearance outside of typical concerns teenage girls have. People call me 'ugly' and laugh at me to my face. I've never been in a relationship of any kind and, at the risk of sounding like an incel, this does not give me hope for the future and makes me question if I am physically attractive to anybody. It makes me feel arrogant for having ever thought that there was nothing wrong with the way I look. And I'm starting to spiral emotionally because of it. 15 year old me would have laughed at the idea of me being so insecure about my physical appearance, but for me, it was one of the few things I had genuine confidence and pride in and now it is being taken from me.

I feel very shallow and fragile for feeling this way. I'm 16 and have four attempts to my name and it's embarrassing. I hate that I'll never really be able to disassociate myself from that because this isn't what I want to look back on in 10 or 20 years time.

Possibility of reincarnation putting me off but making me feel even more trapped...?,"I think about suicide most days. When I visit my 92yr old grandmother in her care home I wish I could be there, waiting to die - how peaceful it must be to know you will be released from all this suffering very soon? 

I consider myself a spiritual person and have been heavily into yoga, meditation and psychedelics and learnt about Buddhist philosophy which is what has formed my beliefs about death. Most people find this a healing path but for me the transcendental experiences I have had have felt like such a homecoming that I haven’t wanted to return to reality. I have never felt at home in myself and often feel like I desperately want to “get out of my body” in which I feel trapped. I have always felt I was born into the wrong body/life. I’ve also believed from a young age that I will die from suicide or a reckless accident. I unsuccessfully attempted age 25 and have had some other near misses. 

The thing I am struggling with is I believe that if I kill myself my soul will return back to the source but I am worried it will be turned around and put right back into another life of equal amount of suffering to mine as my soul won’t have evolved at all. I don’t think I can escape it unless I evolve by overcoming my struggles. I’ve had an eating disorder for 17yrs, as well as BPD and Bipolar. I guess this is the cycle of Samsara and the continual dukkha/suffering which is part of the human condition. 

When I think about this it makes me feel trapped and is going some way to put me off the idea of suicide, but at the same time I feel like I’ve exhausted my energy to try and overcome it all in this life - I’m exhausted in my battle against this ED, it feels completely hopeless.  Perhaps if reincarnation does happen at least I could try overcoming some other set of struggles?

How?,"I just want to be happy. I haven’t been happy for the last four years. The last time I felt that sensation in my brain was my freshman year of college. I was talking to a girl and I could feel the dopamine in my head. That was the last time I felt happy. I’ve been chasing that feeling ever since. The friends have helped make me feel whole. When I’m alone I don’t know what do. I repressed these feelings for a long time. I started watching Bojack Horseman and the feelings came back. Am I a whole person? Am I took messed up too feel love again? I ask myself this every day. When I’m drunk I am able to let these feelings out. I don’t want to be dependent on alcohol to feel this way. I want to talk about my feelings, but I don’t want to be less of a man. Jessica has made me decently happy, but I still don’t feel this way. I don’t want to be dependant on her either. When I beat off I only can finish when I think about personal emotions. I can't even cry anymore. What does that mean? Am I better? I don’t have decency on alcohol. I have stopped for a while and I still feel this way. I don’t know if it is because I’m lonely or because of how messed up I am. When your mother tells you that you should have been a miscarriage you reevaluate life. At the age of thirteen. Is that really an age when you should be questioning your existence? I don’t want pity, I just want to feel normal. When I look at myself I question my life. I have accepted death, but I have also noticed the finite life you have. Once you live, you die. That is scary to me. I just want to cry, but even while writing this I can’t. There are people worse than me, but the way I think about it is, have wasted my life? College is full of life. I haven’t lived one. I wish I was dumb and could fade into the crowd, but I can’t. All I think about is my deathbed and how it won’t be anything. I die and that is it. I’m gone. In high school, I had the same thoughts, but my stepmom said that I’m young and I don’t understand. I find myself having the same thoughts. Maybe nonexistence is fine. I just want to lay in bed and drift away with my mind until I do die. I’m afraid of the loss of thought. Once you're gone your gone. Nothingness. I’m scared. I just want that feeling one more time, but how does happiness happen? Relationship, family, or accomplishment? The future scares me and I don’t want to sit here on shitty earth and have these feelings at fifty. How do people become happy? I’ve lost the feeling and don’t know how to get it back. Once we die that is it. Am I going to die and feel nothing? Is a relationship enough? Or am I broken? I almost want to pass away not think. What does it all mean? Are we just bacteria that evolved enough to think?

My little sister is suic*dal,"Ever since my little sister was in the 3rd grade, she's been extremely unhappy and alone. She had strange rituals where she would obsess over locking the doors (pointing to the OCD she has today) and was the unspoken black sheep of the family. My older sister and I already were aware of her depression, and took her to a counselor (who didn't do much for her). We saw her cutting herself, but were too afraid to approach my parents as they are African. It wasn't until last year, my little sister of eight years old walked into the bedroom and saw my sister h\*nging herself on the back of the door. Luckily we got her in time, and she was admitted in the hospital. After a week or so, she came back beaming and happy. She has a therapist who she ""adores"", and is on medication. Everything was going smooth until she relapsed into her ways, and I caught her in another attempt. She's attempted. around 20 times now. My mom has had to quit her job to watch her. My sister claims she is doing fine, but just the other day I checked her phone and she was searching suicide methods. I have many after-school activities and no one can watch her around the clock. Someone please help me, I'm beyond the point of stressed and I have no determination. My grades have decreased this year because I spend so much time looking after her, yet, she ignores me and complains how people bother her. I'm scared to go to sleep, because sometimes she roams around looking for ways to hurt herself again. How am I supposed to help a teen who doesn't want to help themselves?! I'm in my junior year of high school, (my most important year) and I am completely hopeless. I love my sister so much, I can't even imagine not having her. If someone could offer me advice on how to help her I would really love it.

"Please don't ignore this, I am going through some stuff right now.","I can't fucking stand looking at myself in the mirror, my face is round and my cheeks are too chubby. It's a fucking baby face and I see kids younger than me who are able to have defined jawlines, clear skin etc. But no, not me I have moderate acne and I have psoriasis which is starting to flare up. I try to look after myself, but it gets fucking hard getting out of bed and actually looking after myself when I wish that all of this would go away. 

They say I look like my Dad, as if it were a positive aspect, even though he left me when I was a baby. So what? I'm supposed to be grateful for looking like someone who not only was a deadbeat, but also that I should be grateful that I have to look bad for something I couldn't control. I just want to get plastic surgery ASAP. The only reason why I'm working so hard (or at least trying) is to get enough money to fix this shit. I feel so anxious that I feel like when people talk to me, it's out of pity. Why would you talk to someone who looks ugly? My personality doesn't match my body; I can be aspirational, confident at times (shocking right?) , and empathetic. But then I'm a 6'2, slightly chubby piece of shit and whilst that could potentially be fixed, why the fuck is it so hard for me. I swim about 1.5 - 2 miles a week and I eat okay and I can't lose weight. And if I were to get plastic surgery etc., I know that my family would disapprove it, despite that my siblings look so much better than me, seriously. It's not even my family, but my mum, how would she look at me.

But on the other hand this can't happen any longer. It's like my reputation is based on looks when I'm so much more. I want to cry but no one would care because *where's the reward when it isn't a cute ""depressed"" girl to help?* I get judged for being nice, as if I were trying to get some. Could any of you give me your thoughts on plastic surgery. It pisses me off how I would get criticised, like I'm forced to stay this way but others who are naturally fit get to have a good life. I just can't keep going on.

I remember one time I was talking to someone and felt like I wanted to cry because I was thinking ""no one would ever see me like the way they see other people "" (i.e. romantically). I wanted to die, like I always have. But I cannot for certain personal reasons. Hence I am trying to choose the other method: work really hard and if things don't change I **will kill myself regardless of my morals &amp; the consequences etc.** But please, don't comment the bullshit of ""you'll find someone who loves you for your personality"". That is pity and that fucking beats me to the ground. I had a mini panic attack but I tried to contain it to write this. Opinions would be appreciated. I just wanted to make my mum happy and I still managed to fuck it up, no stories about countless girls, popularity, just a sorry piece of shit that my mum has to love.

I don’t know.,"Dear Reddit, 

Hello everyone here :) 
I’m a 16 year old female. I’m not feeling too well right now. I’m getting these thoughts and suicidal feeling again. They come back occasionally. Right now, I’m eating with my beautiful mother, laughing with my dad as he says my mother is a wonderful cook. I broke down last night when I finished reviewing and studying from my classes. I studied hard for a test I had today, and I felt good about it! Right now, I’m eating as I type this. This day? I thought it would be bad, but it was okay, turning to bad. I’m In a relationship. I love this boy so much. I’ve been happiest with him since years ago. Im a sophomore in high school by the way. I’ve trusted my boyfriend so much and he’s always been there for me. Today however, I felt something was wrong. He didn’t really speak with me. But it’s okay, I’m probably just overthinking it, I want nothing but pure happiness for him. Whether he finds it with someone else or me. I’ve always helped others, always had a smile on my face and I’ve always wanted nothing but happiness for everyone. I’ve only want happiness for everyone else. I want them to feel good and appreciated by atleast someone when they do something. I’ve always supported through anything and I’ve never judged. I’ve been kind to everyone. I appreciate everything that’s given to me, but it’s been a few months I’ve been feeling these usual suicide thoughts. They come often. It’s been a year since I’ve been like this, trying to hang on and move on from it. Whether I see happy moments, times where I love this view. Or others where I’m not sure how I’m feeling.

I felt pressured by my mother. Verbally. I hate trying so hard at school, and failing. What’s the point? I’m going to fail anyways. I’ve always done my best in everything and I’ve always tried to stay happy and look the positive way. But I can’t anymore. I’ve always thought, what if I can just end it? Would anyone really miss me? I think about it, imagining my parents. But, would I really make a difference? Will I go to hell? Religiously talking, I love god. But I’m sorry, I feel like I’ve lost faith in myself. I don’t see it anymore. And every night, I pray, to have a good day, to see my parents, my friends. To stay safe. I want to die, but I don’t. But I want to attempt, but I’m afraid. What if I fail? Would my family be ashamed? 

I think about it daily, and I feel like the only reason I’m
here is for my love. To be there for him when he needs company, to be there for him when he can’t find the light, to be with him when he can’t be happy. To support him through the good and bad. No matter what, no matter the past. For my dad, who’s worked really hard every single night for me and my family. For my friend, who needs support from his friends and family. For my dog, who always listened to me when I felt alone, knowing he wouldn’t understand, but knows I’m upset and let’s me cry on him when I don’t have anyone else.  

I don’t know, I feel like tonight could be it. But I don’t want too I just wonder, would it even matter?",zer0life233,5,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/fe2stx/i_dont_know/,dear reddit hello everyone 16 year old female feeling well right getting thought suicidal feeling come back occasionally right eating beautiful mother laughing dad say mother wonderful cook broke last night finished reviewing studying class studied hard test today felt good right eating type day thought would bad wa okay turning bad relationship love boy much happiest since year ago im sophomore high school way trusted boyfriend much always today however felt something wa wrong really speak okay probably overthinking want nothing pure happiness whether find someone else always helped others always smile face always wanted nothing happiness everyone want happiness everyone else want feel good appreciated atleast someone something always supported anything never judged kind everyone appreciate everything given month feeling usual suicide thought come often year since like trying hang move whether see happy moment time love view others sure feeling felt pressured mother verbally hate trying hard school failing point going fail anyways always done best everything always tried stay happy look positive way anymore always thought end would anyone really miss think imagining parent would really make difference go hell religiously talking love god sorry feel like lost faith see anymore every night pray good day see parent friend stay safe want die want attempt afraid fail would family ashamed think daily feel like reason love need company find light happy support good bad matter matter past dad worked really hard every single night family friend need support friend family dog always listened felt alone knowing understand know upset let cry anyone else know feel like tonight could want wonder would even matter,know,z er 0 life 233,3070,13,z er 0 life 233 dear reddit hello everyone 16 year old female feeling well right getting thought suicidal feeling come back occasionally right eating beautiful mother laughing dad say mother wonderful cook broke last night finished reviewing studying class studied hard test today felt good right eating type day thought would bad wa okay turning bad relationship love boy much happiest since year ago im sophomore high school way trusted boyfriend much always today however felt something wa wrong really speak okay probably overthinking want nothing pure happiness whether find someone else always helped others always smile face always wanted nothing happiness everyone want happiness everyone else want feel good appreciated atleast someone something always supported anything never judged kind everyone appreciate everything given month feeling usual suicide thought come often year since like trying hang move whether see happy moment time love view others sure feeling felt pressured mother verbally hate trying hard school failing point going fail anyways always done best everything always tried stay happy look positive way anymore always thought end would anyone really miss think imagining parent would really make difference go hell religiously talking love god sorry feel like lost faith see anymore every night pray good day see parent friend stay safe want die want attempt afraid fail would family ashamed think daily feel like reason love need company find light happy support good bad matter matter past dad worked really hard every single night family friend need support friend family dog always listened felt alone knowing understand know upset let cry anyone else know feel like tonight could want wonder would even matter know
I can’t forgive myself,"I don’t know how to keep going. I drove away the person I loved the most in the world. I never loved someone like this. But I lied and told him I was completely over my ex. I wasn’t. He said he would leave me if I did. So I lied. And later he found texts. I broke up with my ex for him. But he found us talking about our relationship. I still love you, I told her. He was heartbroken. You cheated on me, he said. I insisted no, it was breaking trust, but you can’t say cheating. I apologized so much. I changed so many behaviors. I couldn’t make it up to him. He finally came to me, didn’t talk to me two months, and said, you cheated on me, you manipulated me. I’m done. He did many things that hurt me during the whole time we knew each other. He left me and came back so many times. It got worse and worse. But it’s not an exchange. No matter his actions, I should have done better. I lost him. He was right. It took me so many months to understand what he really meant. I thought of this every day. Now I get it. I destroyed him. I loved him so much. But this was so disrespectful. I’ll never see him again. I’ll never get to love him again. I did such a bad thing. He’ll never care for me. I need to die. I know everyone will convince me no. But I do. I can’t move on. I can’t forgive myself. This is the person I love with all of my heart. I would do anything for him. I ruined my one chance with him. I ruined it! We can’t be together. I miss him so much. There’s no end to how this hurts. Finally I understand that I deserve it. I don’t want to stop myself anymore. I can’t talk to my friends. They’re so sick of it. I talked to them millions of times. I talk about this every day. I can’t move on. There’s nothing anyone can say. I’m as bad as he said. I’m everything he said I was. I’m an abuser. I never understood it before. I abused him! How could I have done that? How could I not have seen it? How could I not have begged for forgiveness? I hurt him so bad. He wanted to kill himself, it hurt him so bad. I deserve it! To feel like this! I can’t forgive myself. I can’t solve this. I can’t get what I want out of this. He’s so far moved on. It’s over, it’s done, I can’t get over it. I want him back so badly. I miss him so much.

Killing myself tonight,"I've been intensely suicidal since I was about 7. There are so many things that make me this way, and I'm seriously going to snap soon. I can't take it anymore; my dad screaming and threatening to whoop my ass all the time, and my mom smothering me to the point that I don't think she'll ever see me as something other than her sweet little baby. I was almost self harm free for a month, but of course I fucked that up and cut again. I hate myself so fucking much, and I hate myself more for even trying to get help and support from anyone. People have told me to my face to kill myself, yet I don't blame them at all. I'm just a fucking selfish asshole even though I don't even think of myself as human. Every single minor inconvenience makes me want to slit my wrists, which of course, only makes me feel absolutely fucking terrible because there are so many people that have it worse off than me. My dad threatened to beat the shit out of me again, though he didn't do it, and I think that's what's really pushing me over the edge. He's a tall, very muscular guy at 6'4, so it isn't like I could defend myself anyways. I want to kill myself so bad, just to end the world's suffering. I'm such a fucking burden, and it's like everything that comes out of my mouth is just more reason to rid them of my existence. My mom is insanely over protective, always insisting on ""tucking me in"" and kissing me and laying with me. And while that is a lot nicer than being literally beat by your mother, she FORCES me to kiss her. Once, I refused, and she pinned me by my wrists to my bed. I put on such a thick facade that sometimes I don't even know who I am. Nothing I do is actually myself, I'm just pretending for everyone else's sake. People are actually stupid enough to care about me to an extent. Sometimes, I wish it weren't like that, and that they wouldn't be affected by my death. The person that they think they know and love doesn't exist, and nobody knew me before I was how I am. It's not like that matters now; I was just a kid. I'm such a fucking idiot. I hate myself. I'm sorry that this isn't too long, and I'm sorry that it's jumbled around, I've been crying for about three hours and I'm at my wits' end. I love my girlfriend more than I've ever loved anything, and I'd hate to leave her alone when I'm dead, so this post was just to maybe help me get everything out of my head and be a fucking sensible person. There's so much more to say, but right now I really can't think of anything.

I miss the physical affection of being in a relationship and it’s making me feel lonely and suicidal,"I don’t know why but, ever since the breakup with my ex 2 months ago, I’ve been feeling more alone, more suicidal.

Something about being held and comforted by someone who I actually loved was peaceful. I’m a very heavy guy (16 stone heavy) so I’ve always found Bad luck in relationships. Due to this and the countless bullying I suffered due to my weight, I’ve been very depressed and suicidal, and when a person comes into my life, I just get attached to them easily.

I think its time,"I'm posting here because its anonymous and frankly I just wanted to speak my piece before I end it. I feel awful inside, everyday trying to mask the pain with busy work, or arrogance and charm towsrds others to distract myself. I've felt empty for quite some time.

Since then I've had about 6 months of time to really digest my thoughts and feeling. I feel an incredible depression each day and then feel even worse when I think about my children having to deal with my death. For a long time that deterred me from suicide, now it seems more like a valid solution to my pain and a way for everyone to move on. I dont want anyone to find my body which clearly describes suicide. On the contrary I'd like to frame my death so the narrative suggests a noble death and therefore easier on my family. Of course my children love me, but it's been an incredibly long time since I've felt love or purpose. I feel like a paycheck, a slave to everyone else's needs, a pawn in someone else's game. I'm happy that I experienced love, excitement, danger, success but I feel now at the age of 35 the good days of ignorant bliss are behind me.

I am suicidal but I can't kill myself because of laziness.,"I really don't know if this is the appropriate sub-reddit for this but I find it really funny when I become suicidal. 

The intent to kill myself is very strong and it reaches the point that it creates a heavy feeling in my brain and renders my progress with my mental health null. I am quite aware of the progress I made the past few months and I have even considered myself depression-free until I had an episode after feeling very stable for three weeks. I realized that depression isn't a one-time thing that can be cured with constant means of pharmacology.

I am now in this state of wanting to kill myself (again) but is too lazy to get a knife downstairs. I would know damn well that this feeling of emptiness and being suicidal will subside after this episode. Any tips to overcome this recursive state of mine?

Tell me why not and I'm being serious,"I'm a 53 year old man and my life has sucked on so many levels. I've been married and divorced 3 times and several LTRs over the years, including the one I'm in now (over a year and we live together). I've got 5 kids, one just turned 13 last week. She wants nothing to do with me, nor does 2 of her half-sisters, who aren't even nearby (I called DFCS after we split because there were (literally hundreds) of roaches in the apartment in which we lived and she would so nothing about, among other things (like the time her autistic son found her loaded, insecure handgun), but those details are just stuff since I'm now a pariah. 100% would call again. So anyway, no contact with the youngest 3.

But what I'm really struggling with is, ""Why not?""

I know all of the typical reasons involving everyone else, that they'll be hurt, it will affect them horribly, etc. But what about me? Why not? My girlfriend really doesn't like me tbh. (she said I'm the rudest person she's ever met and I believe she means it, even though I've never been told that I was a rude person in 50 years.

But for me, aside from how it affects others, why the hell not? I have no religious faith, because I just don't. If you take away how it affects others, I just don't see a reason to keep living anymore. My job sucks, my girlfriend doesn't even really like me apparently, and I see my parents once a year for 2 days or so and my only brother I haven't seen in 7 tmyears even though we get along.

My hearing sucks, I'm constantly having to ask people to repeat themselves and that frustrates all involved. And even when I don't, I have really loud tinnitus. Neuropathy, ADHD, constant joint pain (not debilitating but always there), frequent memory loss (my gf had to show me pictures of our 3rd date at a steak place because I didn't remember it all and that's not uncommon).

So, why? My current relationship is probably ending soon anyway. For me, what's the point? I don't want to hear about how it affects others because that just adds more guilt to what's already been a pretty shitty life and kinda makes me want to stop that guilt too because I wouldn't have to feel it. I know it's selfish and suicide is indeed probably the most selfish thing I can do. I get that.

But why oh why should *I* want to keep on living when my whole adult life has been a cycle of misery and promises to be more of the same.

I know I shouldn't, right? In my head. But my heart just wants it all to be just over.

These thoughts are getting back into my mind,"I've been there once, told everyone I'd run away and never come back, take my own life because f everything. Life got better for a short while after that but it didn't take long for me to lose everything what seemed worth to me back then. Got divorced, thrown out the flat, a whole lot of lawyer bullshit, and a lot more negative thoughts. Basically haven't been truly happy since then, and as things are turning into shit again, I am feeling that these suicidal thoughts are slowly finding their way back to me. I am on meds and seeking professional help, but I still feel very lost most of the time, feels like I am failing at every little thing I do, turning away from people I adore and not being fair to them, often feels like I am being torn apart form the inside and I am very surely getting sick of it. I've been depressed for as long as I can think of, not sure if I can hold it together for much longer.

My Story (depressed steroid user),"Hey. After much meditation, I decided to create this post, both as therapy for myself and to open up a forum of conversation. I am writing this right before I go to work, so I will probably edit it later. So here it goes. I apologize in advance for my rambling. 

I am currently 20 years old and a sophomore  in college. A few minutes ago I typed in “I’m eventually going to kill myself” into google trying to find some forum post to read. Lo and behold an r/suicidewatch post came up from 3 years ago, which led to me creating my reddit account to make this post.

Throughout my life so far, I have struggled from a crippling loneliness. I was mostly a loner in middle school and high school, one of those arrogant assholes who only care about grades, etc. Inside, however, I had a crippling insecurity about my body image. I have a distinct memory from when I was perhaps 10-11 of staring into the mirror and looking at my face, critiquing every last bit. To those I know, this would not make much sense as I have always been told that I am very attractive. I have never seen it, however. My phone, to this day, is filled with photos that I have taken of myself. 

Deep down, I think that my depression is mostly of a natural physiological basis. Up until I was 18 I had never even held a girl’s hand and up to now I have only kissed one (a very pretty Italian girl who left the country soon after). I have spent most of the last 2 years listening to sad songs, driving aimlessly, chain smoking, and watching movies like Her and Manchester by the Sea. Luckily enough, I do have a best friend that I met in HS who struggles with depression as well. He however, has no problem picking up girls do to his charisma that he has developed over the years as a coping mechanism. Together, we mostly drink, smoke weed, and watch “films.” I always make it a point to get drunk or high enough that my entire life, past and future, flashes before me in a sort of slideshow. 

As I write this, I have been using steroids on and off for 2.5 years. I first started after losing 25 pounds (mostly by starving myself) and then developing an ok physique. I thought that nothing else would make me attractive so I made the decision to buy Testosterone Enanthate off the darknet when I was 17. I didn’t give a shit if I died because, in my mind, there was no other way to find a girl to fill the void inside of me. Now, I am very muscular (5’10’’, 190, around 10% bf), yet my void is not filled and I don’t think it ever will be. 
I am on a solid trajectory right now and will inherit a large sum from my grandfather when I turn 25. This adds no meaning to my life, however. I see myself as a sort of Holden Caulfield or Amory Blaine (from this side of paradise). All I want to do is help people and be loved, but I have a crippling fear that I will only feel loved vicariously, by watching movies and reading books. I can’t shake the feeling that I won’t make it past 40 before I eventually kill myself. My father is currently slowly dying of alcoholism from his depression at 50 just as his father did.

Every time I think of this I am taken back to a memory from when I was a senior in HS. I had been talking to a girl for a month or two and my best friend had hid the fact that he was having sex with her. I had never felt so inadequate in my life. I drove home crying and tied my belt around the doorknob and leaned forward. Thankfully I didn’t follow through with it. This inadequacy still consumes me. I just want hope that someday these feelings will subside.",sacha--102,1,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/fe385v/my_story_depressed_steroid_user/,hey much meditation decided create post therapy open forum conversation writing right go work probably edit later go apologize advance rambling currently 20 year old sophomore college minute ago typed eventually going kill google trying find forum post read lo behold r suicidewatch post came 3 year ago led creating reddit account make post throughout life far struggled crippling loneliness wa mostly loner middle school high school one arrogant asshole care grade etc inside however crippling insecurity body image distinct memory wa perhaps 10 11 staring mirror looking face critiquing every last bit know would make much sense always told attractive never seen however phone day filled photo taken deep think depression mostly natural physiological basis wa 18 never even held girl hand kissed one pretty italian girl left country soon spent last 2 year listening sad song driving aimlessly chain smoking watching movie like manchester sea luckily enough best friend met h struggle depression well however ha problem picking girl charisma ha developed year coping mechanism together mostly drink smoke weed watch film always make point get drunk high enough entire life past future flash sort slideshow write using steroid 2 5 year first started losing 25 pound mostly starving developing ok physique thought nothing else would make attractive made decision buy testosterone enanthate darknet wa 17 give shit died mind wa way find girl fill void inside muscular 5 10 190 around 10 bf yet void filled think ever solid trajectory right inherit large sum grandfather turn 25 add meaning life however see sort holden caulfield amory blaine side paradise want help people loved crippling fear feel loved vicariously watching movie reading book shake feeling make past 40 eventually kill father currently slowly dying alcoholism depression 50 father every time think taken back memory wa senior h talking girl month two best friend hid fact wa sex never felt inadequate life drove home cry tied belt around doorknob leaned forward thankfully follow inadequacy still consumes want hope someday feeling subside,story depressed steroid user,sacha 102,3549,33,sacha 102 hey much meditation decided create post therapy open forum conversation writing right go work probably edit later go apologize advance rambling currently 20 year old sophomore college minute ago typed eventually going kill google trying find forum post read lo behold r suicidewatch post came 3 year ago led creating reddit account make post throughout life far struggled crippling loneliness wa mostly loner middle school high school one arrogant asshole care grade etc inside however crippling insecurity body image distinct memory wa perhaps 10 11 staring mirror looking face critiquing every last bit know would make much sense always told attractive never seen however phone day filled photo taken deep think depression mostly natural physiological basis wa 18 never even held girl hand kissed one pretty italian girl left country soon spent last 2 year listening sad song driving aimlessly chain smoking watching movie like manchester sea luckily enough best friend met h struggle depression well however ha problem picking girl charisma ha developed year coping mechanism together mostly drink smoke weed watch film always make point get drunk high enough entire life past future flash sort slideshow write using steroid 2 5 year first started losing 25 pound mostly starving developing ok physique thought nothing else would make attractive made decision buy testosterone enanthate darknet wa 17 give shit died mind wa way find girl fill void inside muscular 5 10 190 around 10 bf yet void filled think ever solid trajectory right inherit large sum grandfather turn 25 add meaning life however see sort holden caulfield amory blaine side paradise want help people loved crippling fear feel loved vicariously watching movie reading book shake feeling make past 40 eventually kill father currently slowly dying alcoholism depression 50 father every time think taken back memory wa senior h talking girl month two best friend hid fact wa sex never felt inadequate life drove home cry tied belt around doorknob leaned forward thankfully follow inadequacy still consumes want hope someday feeling subside story depressed steroid user

"Nothing matters anymore, getting worse.","Hi..I don't know where else to go. I am devastated right now, feeling like I'm spiraling out of control, I feel so fucking numb from crying my lungs out. Even my best friend is no longer supportive, my family, parents at home are shit. I have no real friends who care, and I can't be bothered to do anything right now, I just want to sleep without waking up to see another morning. I feel so fucking pathetic and shit, I cut myself regularly now and I'm having so much fucking self pity, I'm pretending to be normal because I don't want to lose my best friend, the only person who has helped me come this far from previous suicidal attempts. But suppressing it makes it so much fucking worse I feel like nobody fucking cares, no matter how many times I shout for help. No one close to me cares.  I don't know what to do. I'm leaning towards paracetamol poisoning all over again, if I die I die, If I don't I try a different method. I just feel like absolute shit, jobless. I regret everything in my life, every fucking thing, I don't know who to trust anymore, I don't even have a fucking shoulder to lean on while crying my lungs out. Im in a LDR, from past 6 months, (not prior to that) as she's studying overseas, I can't even fucking have her hold me in her arms when I'm feeling like shit. She is the best and supportive, and my best friend but I can't hurt her by harming myself so It's a fucking struggle. I just feel so enraged and angry at everything..I can't fucking find a job due to covid-19.

"Maybe the world is going down, maybe thats a good thing.","I’m so over it. I’m so over everything. I’ve been getting worse in my isolation, but it yields better results for the world and myself for me to be alone.

Maybe i’ll go insane, but what does it matter. 

My boyfriend does not love me, none of them ever have.

My best friend does not like me that much.

I have so much wrong with me physically and mentally, if society wasnt so accomodating to idiots like myself i’d be dead. I should be dead.

My boss thinks i’m racist because i’m terrible at communicating something. 

Once i loose that job, i’ll have to deal with my dad, who is bad enough as it is to deal with when i do have a job.

Loud noises make me panic, i dont trust anyone, i like to deprive myself of sleep.. if i was anywhere else i’d be dying slowly. Or maybe someone would of come along and put me out of my misery. 

But i dont feel complete without the misery, i dont like to inflict it on others unlike people i know, i just dont feel like myself unless i’m depressed and suffering. I feel greedy if i’m not unhappy.

I listen to everyone, but no one listens to me. When they do, i over do it because i guess i’m just selfish and thats all they see of me. So when i ever open up again, they roll their eyes and leave.

I don't know how to get better,"No one’s really gonna read this, but yeah.  
I’m 15 years old and got diagnosed with depression when I was 12. I strongly dislike talking about my ‘negative’ feelings, partially because of trauma, partially because I’m afraid people will look at me differently. When I finally did open up about it, it didn’t really go well and got immediately dragged to a doctor to see ‘what’s wrong with me’. I’m afraid to open up again.  
Once I got into therapy, literally before the second appointment I send the therapist an email saying I feel much better now and don’t need therapy, because I thought it wouldn’t work.  
I know bottling up my emotions isn’t healthy, but it’s all I’ve been doing my entire life. I do sometimes talk about it online, but that’s all, and even then, I just feel awkward and like a burden to the people that have to listen to me.   
I got held back last year because ‘I didn’t feel like going’ (which is what I told everyone) when I couldn’t get out of bed and tried really hard to not kill myself. I had my second suicide attempt that year. I didn’t want to tell anyone, like my teachers, friends or trusted ones because people know me as happy, bubbly, dumb and annoying, or something like that anyway. I feel like a fucking failure.  
I thought my mindset would change over time, but it never did. This year, I’m doing a tiny bit better, I’m less absent, but I’m still not doing great at school. It’s not really that it’s hard, I just don’t have any motivation at all. I always thought I wouldn’t make it past 15, or would just end up killing myself anyways so what’s the point?  
But I want to stay alive for some of my family and friends. So, suicide isn’t an option anymore. What will I do know? I want to live, but I have no motivation at all. It’s like everything’s just a big joke. I know I should care, but I don’t.

Advice to hold on two more weeks??,"Don't mind the grammar. I'm Dutch.

**Don't read if you are easily triggered. I don't want any of you feel bad/worse.**

Okay, some of you already start typing reasons to stay alive. Y'all are so kind for doing that. I miss kind people. Everyone leaves me 'cuz I'm depressed. And everytime I'm in my deepest point of a 'depression wave', somebody dies. Like life also tries to convince me I should kill myself.

So I heard in August I could go to a mental hospital in MARCH. So at that point it sounded so far away that I gave up and neglected myself. Cuz everyday was hell. And I was supposed to wait 6 months. **But** of course I was thankfull my psychiatrist got me on the list of the mental hospital that is specialised in autism. So I was too scared to really tell I wouldn't survive until then.

I've been severe depressed in october. Didn't really come out of my room except for diner or to go to the toilet. Selfharmed the whole day long, slept when I was tired, not on a certain time so my sleep rythm was ruined. Gained weight. Couldn't concentrate on anything. Like I was in my mind already fading away. I became sure life was giving my signs that I should die. Everything that could go wrong, DID go wrong. And in my deepest point, my grandma died. I still haven't accept it. Her death didn't feel real for days. It was on the funeral where it felt like life punched me in the head. The amount of emotions were so much that I tried to not be in the reality anymore. Thinking about an alternate life. Writing stories and imagining me in it constantly.

I think that last thing gave me a depersonalisation disorder or something. I don't know how it works and I know I can't diagnose myself. But on moments where I have a lot of emotions or when I'm a little stressed, I feel like I'm watching my body experiencing things. Like I'm the coördinator in my head watching through my eyes. I can't really talk or think cuz I feel like my body should talk or think in that situation. I'm just watching what happens and take decisions.

And then late October... I was standing on the edge of the bridge and decided to talk to an old friend, instead of jumping at that moment. (She has DID, and one of her personalities is an agressive one who made me dissociate when she wanted me to kms). You can say she's a bad influence, but she's the only one still standing by me and the only one with the same kind of humor. She has help so the thing that happened last year won't happen again.

Anyway, I became a little happier, started enjoying going outside again. I made friends in a therian community cuz I figured back in August I was a therian too. (whatever your opinion is about 'therians', pls dont post them here cuz this isnt what the post is about)

Idk why, but I knew I was going into a depressed moment again, as I was irritated everyday and selfharming again.... So I landed in the depressed wave again. Or should I say drowning? I don't enjoy anything, every food tastes boring. I can't sleep cuz I cry every damn night. I'm constantly thinking about kms. I'm even trying it, or sort of searching boundaries. Taking pills but just enough to still stay alive. Or standing on the edge of the bridge but not jump.

What triggered my to write this post, was because I heard a cat of mine has cancer and he may not survive another week. The cat that shoved his fur in my face :') so I got a little distracted in a traumatising situation which happened 2/3 years ago. (Can't talk about it now cuz PTSD flashbacks will kill me with this amount of emotions I have now) The cat that walks over my legs, jumps in my neck and demands attention when I'm crying on the floor in the middle of the night. He is like my ESA (not official one) And I'm about to lose him. I can't go through this. I can't lose the last string of the rope that I'm holding on the edge of a ravine. I feel like kms at the moment. I don't wanna die. I wanna be of this pain.

Transgender Wasted Life,"I am in my early 30s, transgender MtF and my life is in ruins.  I have no friends and I don't mean that figuratively, I mean it in a literal sense. Nobody cares about me. I used to have a decent life until some bad decisions and mistakes. I've never taken drugs or been addicted to anything (not that it matters) just trusted some of the wrong people including my parents.   


About four years ago, I moved back home to be with my sick mother. In doing so, I fucked myself over. She died about a year later and I became stuck in the middle of nowhere with no transportation and now surviving off of the 'generosity' of some very religious family.  I am living alone in a small mobile home on my family's property. I am unable to have guests. I am unable to find work because I don't have transportation and other reasons. I have severe depression and social anxiety. I have mild OCD. I haven't been able to be on hormones for the past 4 years. I am not myself.   


Please forgive the rambling nature of this post. I'm just typing as it comes to my head. I have no future. I have no viable possibility of getting out of this and starting my life over.  I live in a mobile home infested with bed bugs. I've slept on the floor for four years without even changing my sheets or blankets. I haven't had laundry detergent in four years. I wash my underwear in the bathtub. The heater has been messed up all winter so I've been freezing. I have one blanket and one sheet. No pillows after they got infested with bed bugs.   


All I've eaten for the past three years are potatoes, macaroni and cheese and balogne sandwiches. I haven't been able to even leave the house in 3 years and the last time was for my moms funeral. I can't even shave my face or legs because I haven't had razers, shaving cream or anything in three years. I haven't had face wash. I've had the same bottle of shampoo for three years. I've had four bars of soap for the past three years... My kitchen sink doesn't work, I wash my one plastic bowl in the bathroom sink.  I don't speak to anyone. I'm essentially already dead. Although I doubt I get 2000 calories a day, the type of foods I've eat have made me gain at least 30 pounds and so none of my clothes fit me. I have one pair of stretchy pajama pants and two tshirts that fit me.  It could be worse, i could be homeless so I've kept this inside for this long but I'm tired. My life is really already over. I'm exhausted. After this month, I won't have internet and I am fairly certain with nothing to do at all, no music etc, I will go insane. So I've made peace with my fate and I guess this is the last month of my life. I don't remember what happiness is. I can't even think of anything that could change my life at this point. There isn't even a dream. There just isn't a point to go on at this point.    


I feel like a failure. I feel sad and hurt. I found one of my mom's journals recently, she mentions she was raped by her father when she was a kid. So that is the energy surrounding me. I'm stuck here, isolated and treated like an animal basically. If I were to die, nobody would care or probably even notice. So thats it. I can't think of anything else to say. But I needed to get it off my chest.

"I'm going nowhere fast, and I'm all alone","I'm 19 and first attempted at age 7. I've basically wanted to die for most of my life. I've attempted several times since then. Most recently I was about to in august but realized just before starting that the mode i selected was physically impossible for me.

I am not in college and am unemployed and looking for a job. I've been looking for months, but I live in an isolated area and don't know how to drive so my options are nonexistant. 

When I was in school, I was active in theater and would ask my closest friends to come to my performances, and they had no desire to support me, even though they knew how much it meant to me, even though I offered to arrange a ride for them and pay for their tickets. I was always the one who had to make plans, and my best friends would frequently cancel plans on the day of. One of my best friends was still in her pajamas when I came to pick her up once, and she told me she didn't feel like going out after all and shut the door in my face. This same friend called me an hour after my 18th birthday party started already to tell me that she would rather not go. 

I haven't seen most of my friends since graduation, and most of those I have, when I run into them in public, they ignore me or pretend not to recognize me. I have a bunch of internet friends I'm close to and have known a while, but they like when I send them funny memes but they don't care about me as a person, and I don't blame them. My family doesn't really care either. They did when I was growing up because I'm the youngest, but now that I'm an adult no one gives a shit. 

My parents had a big messy divorce and the bank took the house as a result, and I had to give up my whole life and everything I've ever known to move halfway across the state with my mom. The whole experience was very traumatic and I'm plagued by horrific nightmares every night. I've been on 3 different antidepressants in the last 6 years, and not one has worked. I have a lot of health problems too, which have only worsened despite my best efforts.

I have no direction for myself. I don't want to go to college. I'm in constant pain. All I can think about is wanting to die. I beg god all the time to let me die, because i can't take it anymore, but I'm still here. What I wanted more than anything was to be in the entertainment business, but I've been refused even ensemble parts in every audition.

Feels like a weight's sinking me down.,"No matter how much I struggle, I always end up feeling awful and get off track from pursuing my goals.

Thinking feels tiring for me, so I tend to spend most of my life in a dissociative fugue state, if that makes sense? I feel anxiety when I force myself to think analytically. 

I also feel like I can't ask for help from anyone around me. I'm mostly a stoic person who's infamous for showing no outward emotion, so people mostly get amused when I'm upset, which enrages me.

Slitting wrist doesn't work; this is a rant. advice on what's good about living?,"I tried it last week, it didn't work AT ALL. Media is a scam. I think for it to work it's gotta be super deep and you gotta bleed for a long while before anything starts to happen.

... My ideal has always been carbon monoxide, but idk how to make that work. Isn't it dangerous (lol) if the house catches on fire if I'm just burning firewood or something in a bucket in a carpeted room? (recommendations?)

But in the process of thinking I was going to die, I did not regret anything at all and even felt peaceful for the first time in a long while. I think it's a good choice for me personally so I need to figure out the CO plan. However, I cut my wrist on a whim and know rationally that I am young and have family and people who I know will be disappointed/devasted if I take my life, so I need to wait until I'm older so that, to put it morbidly, at least my immediate family dies of natural causes first. But it's still very saddening to live, especially knowing death comes so easily (despite my strong survival instincts).

***What do you like about living?***

I'm looking for little things such as ""some beds are very comfortable,"" because ""things will get better"" is the stupidest BS I never want to hear again. Therapy/social workers are also just normal people anyways so don't tell me there's help either. Or share a funny joke. I once called crisis line for a funny joke the lady was like ""wat? wat? do you want to tell me ur problems?""

Hell no. If I talk about my problems I'll just be reminded of them again and get even sadder than I originally needed to me.

My Last Week On Earth,"The reasons why:
- Severe depression. No cure and never getting better.
- 30 year old virgin. Still don't know how to make friends or talk to girls.
- Not able to focus myself and get into the field I want...so stuck at crappy jobs.
- About to be fired from crappy job #9 for being late too much. (Late almost every day cause I can't sleep nd can't get myself out of bed in the morning)
- Massive debt due to school loans, car repairs, and me being stupid.
- Bank account at $-111. Could have afforded the make the account positive today if the bank would waive the fees one more day. But they won't so I can't.

Basically I can't manage time, money, sleep, or a social life. So I'm calling it here...game over.

I get paid Friday.
Going to buy a gun.
Gonna make sure my cat has plenty of food and water, and someone to take her when I'm gone.
Treat myself to whatever I want for the best last meal i can afford.

I dont know if its worth the read but this is my life this is how i feel and if you do read it can you answer the question at the end. thank you,"I'm writing this because I've just once again thought about killing myself but this isn’t even within the first 100 times I have thought of suicide from a young age I’d say roughly around age 11-12 I first thought of just ending it I even remember how I sat at a window ledge looked down and just bathed in the moment before climbing back down with tears coming down my face because I wasn’t strong enough to. 

Wow… well I bet that sounded crazy I wasn’t strong enough to kill myself a direct contradiction of what strength is but a las I and any other who has felt how I feel will relate. 

So about me, of course you must be wondering how did he get this fucked up what has happened. Well im going to let you all know just in case once day I do get my strength. I am one of 10 children slotting in at number 7, I have been emotionally and physically abused by those who were supposed to nourish me. Here’s whats different though so not only did they make my life hell they controlled my life where I was and what I was doing to the extent that I couldn’t even make my own decisions on the little things and still cant. 

Thing’s I have been beaten for just so you get the vibe

·  As a child I would pee in my sleep so I would be woken up by a belt hitting my body

·  As all kids do I would fall asleep on the sofa watching tv, so I would be woken up with a belt hitting my body

·  I once told my dad there was no point in doing something AGAIN because nothing was good enough for him… to which I was beaten with a metal pole until I could no longer use my arms to defend my self and just took blows to the head dripping blood all over the house.

**To summarise I have been fucked up.**

But im trying to figure out how and when this all started at what point did I become the person I am now (Afraid ,insecure ,manipulative and untrustworthy). I give myself these attributes because that’s all I really am. I am afraid of the world horrified possibly I have ran out of classes (IN FUCKING UNI) because I felt as if everyone was looking on me I have this crippling feeling that everyone is always looking at me. Insecure lol I don’t even know what to say I have deleted everything on my social media’s multiple times purely because the anxiety of someone giving a fuck enough to look at them and then the possibility of them finding my pictures funny gives me so much anxiety that I’d prefer them not be there. Am I manipulative yes, but I don’t understand how one can not be manipulative. I like to have things my way of course we all do but I know how to get it done I know how to get responses out of people or to get people to do what I want because I had to learn to. I'm one of fucking 10 children and I showed up in the middle and this wasn’t no brady bunch happy family shit this was controlling, abusive and manipulative and I guess that’s what I became, you are a product of your environment after all. I don’t really know the purpose or direction of this as I have just stopped crying again (its 2:13pm) and decided fuck it imma do this so if I do kms at least maybe one mf’er can know what I been trying to say.

So guys I think im going crazy this is a new development if you don’t mind me starting here, I sit in my room and talk to myself inside my head for hours a day full on conversations (guess this is what happens when you don’t get to train social skills). Sometime’s I cry sometimes I get so angry I don’t even know what to do and sometimes admittedly I feel straight up heart broken as if I have been done a disservice by the world and unfairly I was born into one family instead of another. I fantasize too much and I kind of sorta relate to people from Netflix series. Like Joe the stalker I get it bro you just want to feel a solid love that aint going no where and youll do anything to keep that but in turn you require a few things loyalty being one of them. Fortunately I can say I don’t relate to him with his killing (that would just be another burden in my head to drive me crazier) instead when my heart is broken people just kick the pieces to side and move on. 

Fuuuuuuck im really not good at structuring things I write.

Ok I think the logical thing to do is start with little stories from childhood and work my way to present day. 

I was born in 1998 in Africa and moved to the United Kingdom at a young age not sure how young because I don’t remember. My dad had been previously married and had 5 children from his first wife and at this time only 3 from my mum me and my 2 brothers one a year older one a year younger. It’s said that when I was born they thought I was a fucked up baby, I was going to be disabled or something of the sorts (not in a doctor said it way, but like I was born and they looked at me and said na this aint it way and little would you know my little brother was born just under 10 months later) Fantastic way to start life. So we all lived in one house when we first got to the UK (very vague memory of this shit by the way combination of what I've been told as fact and what I know to be true) So as a kid I have been described as a quiet and timid kid so quiet infact that my older brother and sister (age 12-14) (from a different mother) would pinch me or hit me to make me cry because when I would cry it was funny that I would make no noise.  I was also a huge fan of lion king asking them to watch it multiple times a day with me, everyday. We then moved a couple times memory all blurry and we arrived at the next destination that I remember. We lived in a flat in a small town in England for a couple years, my memories of this place are my   constantly injuring himself severly by playing out, dbz, Toonami, vegeta and ps2. I was a normal kid but I would get fucked up by my dad. (btw im around 4-6 years old) I still remember the time I was called downstairs just to be beaten I think for drawing a rude picture that was discovered after I had just been beaten. Boom boom not too much going on just the entrance to a life of suffering but not too much tbh.  


We then moved to a council house elsewhere just kids and mum because dad had decided its stressful to live with people so he’d rather pay 1k+ rent elsewhere for his own place then help his family. These years weren’t too bad though if anything they were my favourite because he wasn’t around it was just us 3 years in that place from year 2- year 5. He would still drive down though on occasion just to hit us and then return to his home on the flip side of the uk. This was fantastic for my personal growth of course as I learnt that being a father means coming over shouting and arguing with your wife, beating your children and then cutting. And by beating I mean sure we were between ages 7/8-10 but he would hit us with all he had leave belt marks for days all over my body. To the extent the neighbour’s would hear us screaming and would then mock us the next day as we walked to school. He then thought that we were becoming bad children (at the time me and all my siblings were top in our classes thanks to our mum keeping us up to study with her , as well as this at this age we started being forced to go to mosque mon- fri (5-7) and then over the weekends we would go to Arabic school and if we were at home we would play outside in the park so I don’t know how bad we could of really been but who knows.(she was in college so while she did her homework she helped us with ours)). Actually with that being said I would steal from my mum not a lot and not everyday but a pound or 2 here and there just because everyone else in school could afford to buy things like sweets and toys and I would never be able to join in because I had none. I would come home from school and mums not in so id have to sit outside the house for a couple hours people would walk by but I had no friends house to go to like my brothers so I would just sit at the door and wait. My life has been hell maybe its easy from an outside view to say naa aint that bad but try live it everyday you come home aint no body even in, by the time everyone does get in its all at once no time for you and mum to talk no dad asking how was school bruh go to  sleep. To summarize though I was studying everyday 7 days a week and still being beaten along with my brothers but I had a newly born sister and it was time for the move to the big city so fuck it maybe its about to get better.Bruh I forgot and now remembered this nigga would look all 3 of us in the garage for whole days just because and the punishment for leaving would be you get beat and thrown back in there. Think about the mentally how much that would fuck you up you aint even fucking 10 yet.

When we first got to this new city we were quick to discover its rough out there day one we were robbed. They were no more parks we could just go to play at so now I became and indoors kid. To go along with that now my dad didn’t live too far away he was only in the neighbouring town so instead of monthly “visits” it was now weekly. Fair enough to say within a year I had put on I don’t know 10 maybe 15kg I was fat af going into year 7 but in year 6 I was a very thin framed kid. I was depressed and I'm not sure if I knew it but my life consisted of go to school and be bullied to come home and be beaten not knowing where my safe place was I chose solitude I learnt out of sight out of mind (didn’t even work all the time but nigga I tried) My mum became pregnant again… (this was not necessary but I've grown to love the child) so now they are soon to be 5 kids and none of which already receive and adequate amount of love. Just to further paint the character of my father he beat my younger sister who was at the time maybe 3/4 because she took and hid his phone (later revealed he left it in his jacket pocket) NO APOLOGY HAS EVER BEEN GIVEN EVER IN HISTORY FOR A MISTAKEN BEATING. We spent little time in that house but what do ire member being dragged from under a bed to be beaten and being beaten nearly every morning without fail for 1/2  years for bed wetting (punches were not pulled).   


We moved again after same sort of thing really he’d show up for a few days fuck up everyones mood and cut no one wanted him around but no body would say because everyone was afraid of getting beat again. This is the house I lived in when I decided ahh man maybe this life thing isn’t for me went and sat at the window ledge in my room 3rd floor looking down and wished I could just let go. We would be locked in the attic this time the door is genuinely locked we couldn’t get out if we wanted room was what 3x4 meters storage room basically and 3 of us had been locked in there for the whole day. Living in such circumstances created bitch nigga behaviour amongst us as brothers because the beatings were bad you did not want to be beaten it would fuck your whole shit up. So niggas started snitching bruh my own brother came in my room while I was learning to beat my meat took my phone took pictures of what I was watching and then showed everyone while I was sat in the living room… I was then promptly beaten. This the environment I grew up in even in your own fucking room you couldn’t do shit you couldn’t trust nobody and you were very likely going to be fucked up for anything you did. This could include but was not limited to holding your brothers hand while fighting… (that’s gay apparently so you would be beaten). Defending yourself to your parents (Its rude to speak back so I was beaten), Not speaking (its rude to not speak when spoken to so I was beaten). Finishing the milk bruh imagine your 12 year old hungry self wanted some cereal finished it and then gone beaten for it that was my fucking life. Id go to school this fat unloved ugly kid, (I think this is a good time to point out I went to a bad school in a white neighbour hood and as we all know aint nothing scarier than poor white people jk…) but those guys were harsh to me day one of highschool I had a fight why because I was being racially abused, I was constantly racially abused I was not even accepted by my own race because I wasn’t black enough (I am quarter white 3 quated black so skin color dark brown meant I was a paki, I was an Indian I was a terrorist osama bin laden was my uncle so on and so forth) aint no body ever gave a shit about me not a single teacher not no body. And this is where things get fucked up for me this when I started doing dumb shit I started being a prick to my friends not fully understanding what was even going on but just thinking out of I gotta cover my back I gotta make sure I aint no punk but in reality it made me into a punk. But ill get to that later. I still remember everything nice people have ever said to me that I felt was said genuinely though, once the most popular kid in school told me to not let anyone pick on me and just tell them im not Asian although I had tried both I felt his sincerity and very much appreciated it and still think about it to this day. 

I wanna fast forward now to year 11 when shit really hits the fan, I moved to a school which was mixed gender (years 7-10 I was in a boy school) and the introduction of women had definitely caught my eyes (hadn’t seen them in many years since everyday was school mosque home runescape repeat maaaaaaaaaan FUCK THAT SHIT that’s the worst childhood and to make it better slide a couple hundred beatings in over those 3 years and now you might be beginning to get a grasp on who I am as a person. Of course they are little moments when things workout but not really. To summarise I was in love or atleast I felt like I was I did horribly on my exams which at the time I accreted to me just focusing my time on her and not myself and that started the downwards spiral. My little brother told my parents I wasn’t fasting at prom (I have not ever fasted a day since, pretty sure I gave up on religion a long time ago but that’s its own thing) and I was beaten then locked in the house so I could not attend my final meeting for NCS (I had saved up my 5 a week for 10 weeks to pay the 50 to go and now I just couldn’t imagine that feeling I was going to finally be away from this whole home all summer and now I couldn’t why because my dad who had now moved in full time had decided to spite me).  


The summer of finishing high school of enjoyment had arrived my plans to be with my friends had been put to a halt. My plans of going to a top 3 college in the city had been put to a halt. My summer was instead me just sitting in my room everyday the whole summer alone not talking to anyone for multiple days at a time. This is when my solitude became serious I became an awkward nervous rek after this I couldn’t even talk to people properly without overthinking everything id say if summer was 10 days long I was beaten on 6/7 days as well so yh torture house and to make it better I had no friends because we moved so fucking much I didn’t know a single person and couldn’t get to know them because we lived in a jewish neighbour hood and if you’ve ever lived in one as the only black muslim family you aint going to have no friend. But yh returned to college and it was ok except for everyday I would come home and be locked out of my house everyday without fail my dad would sit in the kitchen looking out the window and laugh at me having nowhere else to go so I would sit in the gardens storage cupboard nothing much at all probably just a big wardrobe but It was dry. I would then go to college and repeat this process day by day mentally exhausting my self little by little more once again through in beatings on.4 out of every 10 days and you have the image of what my first year of college was like. My parents decided as a family we should read the quran together (muslim people book not all of it like a page each a day) so I read my page and left and while I was goning upstairs I heard him talking about me so I decided ah im probably going to be beaten let me stay here and wait so I did and soon enough I heard him say “why did he read that page, he read that a few days ago hes looking for the easy ones” so my mum said “ill call him back down and he can read again”, I was called “….. come downstairs and read again” and I replied “Whats the point nothing I do is good enough for him anyway” to which he responded by walking into the kitchen getting a metal pole and coming to hit me with it. The best bit for him it was a detached house so no one could even hear my screams. At first I tried to block with my left arm and then I just couldn’t hold it up anymore so I switched to the right and the same happened so then I was just lying there being beaten by my dad with a metal pole bleeding all over the floor from my head and when he thought he was done he left. This day is the day I lost my shit as soon as I could stand I went and grabbed a knife but was stopped by my mother (I always found it funny how she would always come to stop me but never him). I then called the police when they arrived they was so much blood on the ground floor corridor that she threw shoes over to hide it because it could not be cleaned while he sat there on the sofa smug knowing he had gotten away with it my mum had hidden me from the police and that was that another great day in the life. 

I had become sick of it and told my mum I do not care what she thinks I am tired and I am leaving I will go to foster care if I must but I am not dealing with this shit anymore (I don’t know if its important but I was also 17 without a phone or laptop or any communication with the outside world, if I was in my room all day I was playing badminton against the wall staring at the ceiling or creating fantasies in my mind to rescue me from where I was currently) I told her ill get a job (just received ni number) ill figure it out for myself and what did she do?

She said nothing for maybe a month and then we were moving house so she came in one morning and just told me we are moving pack up so I did thinking we are moving away from that cunt and she had chosen me her son over her manipulative controlling abusive husband… Instead she had rented another place and just dropped me off there would come round maybe every month or 2 for an hour or so and that was my life. Now I was completely secluded and this was the first time I actually tried to kill myself I had a panic attack the anxiety just got to me I took all my sleeping pills at once and boom I woke up the next day… they were all fucking natural herbal things and they couldn’t do shit. Bummer I know. She still doesn’t know about this I continued thinking about killing my self shit I never stopped from that first time till now but It was just thoughts and ideas I had finally tried to and failed. Instead I started smoking weed which would help sometimes but other times like I learnt the hardway it would make me think about my life and whats actually happened and compare it to my peers around me and I would breakdown crying. My life has no direction, I have no family around me (which is ironic in a family of 13(3 parents 10 kids))because we had all been tormented soo much we didn’t know to look out for eachother we had to look out for our selves first. This is why im selfish I cant afford to not be because if im not my own number 1 In terms of in a greedy way like If I don’t look out for ME first no one else will. My mum then told me she didn’t want to continue paying for where I lived and I had to find somewhere else (now that I was 18/19) which is a real bitch because if I had just done what I wanted to years back and left this family of suffering I would have been alright but instead now im going to college everyday thinking about where tf am I going to live. So I dropped out of college to work, I ended up returning to college having to restart living in a city different to the one I studied in working night shifts to then go straight in to class but I figured it out. Got to uni and guess what I don’t know what the fuck is going on. 

Everyone is social and I don’t know how to socialise sometimes I feel as though I stand out so badly that im just not supposed to be there im surrounded by people who life has blessed people who have seen the world people whos parents love them soo much that they even come to watch them train at uni. In my whole fucking life there has never been a single thing I've done which I can say I looked into the crowd and had a single person there to support me. Instead I have been told to dream is free, I've been told your not going to make anything with your life and you are going to be a failure. Honestly I have accepted these as truths now. I don’t even feel like myself anymore I feel stupid as if i took a couple too many hits to the head information doesn’t sink in properly anymore. I'm embarraced in class because everyone else knows what they are doing to some level I have no fucking idea everyone else goes home for Christmas or there family comes to visit. LOOOL my family don’t give a single fuck. I AM ALONE IN THIS WORLD TIRED DEPRESSED AND READY TO GO. I accepted death a little while back, one night I was lying in bed crying and realised I don’t have to deal with this anymore I really don’t I have accepted I will kill myself and I am just waiting for the day in which I get my final little nudge to step of the ledge.

I just want to be at peace.

I also had a girlfriend for a while she cheated on me so I stopped valuing her as a person and just kept her for the other stuff. She even got pregnant and aborted it. I'm 20.

I think I’m going to kill myself tonight,"I don’t really know what to right tbh

I’m a 15 year old trans guy, came out when I was like 11 and waited on the Tavistock (the uk gender clinic) for like 3 years and then once I got there they distarged me cos I don’t have any fucking friends anymore and my step dad was being a prick so that apparently means I don’t know shit about myself, we literally only had like idk 3 meetings. I had been waiting so fucking long for this. I feel so fucking dysphoric all the fucking time I hate my body so fucking much. I just want enough testosterone to at least make my voice a little deeper. And what’s pushed me to the edge is when I went out yesterday literally 5 people called me a girl and my mum and step dad have pretty much given up on calling me a boy and by my pronouns, they always call me a girl/thier daughter and use she/her. And even if I do get to transition this society is so fucking transphobic like just on fucking twitter or some shit and on every post to do with trans folks it’s always so negative like there’s a whole wave of even cis lgbt ppl hating us. Literally what’s the fucking point. I’ve already attempted suicide over this when I was 12 and camhs did absolutely nothing, no therapist or anything. I have not a single friend except for like one online friend and literally every family member that was like ‘oooh you tried to kill yourself this is so sad’ has hardly spoken to me since plus I haven’t even met half of my family and my biological dad hardly ever speaks to and keeps on arranging times for us to meet them cancelling like the only person that might actually be upset about me dying is my cat.

Anyway, I already have 2 codomsl pills with me right now and according to google I only need like 5 in one go to kill myself and there’s probably way more in the house so yeah can’t be arsed with life and I have literally ~nothing~ to live for so, goodbye",potaturtle112,19,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/fdno60/i_think_im_going_to_kill_myself_tonight/,really know right tbh 15 year old trans guy came wa like 11 waited tavistock uk gender clinic like 3 year got distarged co fucking friend anymore step dad wa prick apparently mean know shit literally like idk 3 meeting waiting fucking long feel fucking dysphoric fucking time hate body fucking much want enough testosterone least make voice little deeper pushed edge went yesterday literally 5 people called girl mum step dad pretty much given calling boy pronoun always call girl thier daughter use even get transition society fucking transphobic like fucking twitter shit every post trans folk always negative like whole wave even ci lgbt ppl hating u literally fucking point already attempted suicide wa 12 camhs absolutely nothing therapist anything single friend except like one online friend literally every family member wa like oooh tried kill sad ha hardly spoken since plus even met half family biological dad hardly ever speaks keep arranging time u meet cancelling like person might actually upset dying cat anyway already 2 codomsl pill right according google need like 5 one go kill probably way house yeah arsed life literally nothing live goodbye,think going kill tonight,pot turtle 112,1891,40,pot turtle 112 really know right tbh 15 year old trans guy came wa like 11 waited tavistock uk gender clinic like 3 year got distarged co fucking friend anymore step dad wa prick apparently mean know shit literally like idk 3 meeting waiting fucking long feel fucking dysphoric fucking time hate body fucking much want enough testosterone least make voice little deeper pushed edge went yesterday literally 5 people called girl mum step dad pretty much given calling boy pronoun always call girl thier daughter use even get transition society fucking transphobic like fucking twitter shit every post trans folk always negative like whole wave even ci lgbt ppl hating u literally fucking point already attempted suicide wa 12 camhs absolutely nothing therapist anything single friend except like one online friend literally every family member wa like oooh tried kill sad ha hardly spoken since plus even met half family biological dad hardly ever speaks keep arranging time u meet cancelling like person might actually upset dying cat anyway already 2 codomsl pill right according google need like 5 one go kill probably way house yeah arsed life literally nothing live goodbye think going kill tonight
"I just got fired for comments I didn’t mean to say and ended up upsetting co-workers. It was my first termination in life for that reason. As long as I have that on my conscience, then I think death is better than trying again.","I was called and told over the phone by my employer that “we have to to cut ties” because of some comments, assuming bad jokes out of recall, I wasn’t aware they upset my co-workers. My first reaction led me to punch my fist into a wall in a public area and now my mind is swirling with thoughts of candid anger. This was my first firing and I’m not processing it well. My first thought is why bother apply for other jobs when I have the reason on my conscience? Second, if I do try again, then I better embrace the bias hateful questioning about my termination. Third if I tell anyone, then I will lose everyone close to me. Fourth, if I tell my parents, I will be a shame and burden to have committed such an act.

Life sucks without money.,"It’s just constant fucking stress. I literally would rather die than deal with this for one more day. I can’t even afford my bills. I had to go on a subreddit and beg for money. Luckily someone helped me out. But that is not sustainable. I don’t know what to do anymore. I moved across the country to “start over” and all I did was put myself way behind where I was in life. I had $5000 saved up to move and it’s all gone. The job I lined up before I got here is complete shit. I only get eight hours a week. Eight fucking hours. That’s down from twenty when I first started. And I’ve applied for every fucking job in this town with no calls back. I thought I was doing something wrong until I heard other people from work talking about having the same problem. It’s a college town so every job is a competition with like 20,000 students. 

I don’t know what the fuck to do anymore. I miss being able to go out and do things. Or even just handle my own problems as they come up. My snake had to go to the vet and I had to call and ask my grandparents to loan me money. Its so depressing. I just paid rent and now I have $20. That has to last until my next shift which is in like five days and in that time I have to buy cat litter and pay my electric bill.

I want to die,"To be honest, I'm 35 not much good has come of things. I studied hard and undertook an education degree at 25. It ended up making my mental health worse and I quit during my prac placement. I finished with a shitty Arts degree, but ended up with Honors...  It's not that I am unintelligent or incapable... In fact it shows some capability but no one is interested in what I do and I have no contacts so it makes it near impossible to get in to the job market.

I have panic disorder,  I am having panic attacks every day now (sometimes multiple times a day) which makes my life insufferable.  I have to use Xanax to maintain some what of a normal life... otherwise people think I am just lashing out at people (I'm not it's the condition). No one seems to understand anxiety, panic, and agitation. Doctors don't do shit, hospitals do even less. I've gone to hospital asking for help and am just put back out on the street.

I have been given Propranalol for anxiety. I have since told the  hospital I will swallow a whole bottle of Propanalol soon and no one cares if I do... It's the same result that I just get put back on the street even when I do ask for help.

I'm about to be made homeless and I can't support myself due to my chronic anxiety condition (panic disorder). My life sucks and there is no way to fix it.

I've suffered domestic violence and abuse in my family from the beginning until now and now I have finally had enough. I have been told to move out of the house I am living in. I have no reason to try or any interest in trying anymore.

If I will not die by Propanalol I'll simply buy barbiturates and do it once and for all properly. At this point the fear of going to prison for buying barbiturates does not bother me. I know how and where to get what I need to die...

Done,"Been suicidal for a few years and today im done. Ive been bullied since grade 1, my father used to abuse me when i was young, i was lied too by damn near everyone, lost my mom in 2018, attempted on multiple ocasions, nobody ever fucking listens to me, and im finally past my tipping point. I haven't had the thoughts for a minute now but today they came back full force and I frankly am just tired of living. Life fucking sucks and Im over it. Tonight i plan on taking my life.

EDIT: final message before I go. Since im going to go anyways, i pulled out my vape (i quit multiple times already) and started going to town. My throat now burns and I feel super weak (head rush from the nicotine) so I plan to relax, and when I can move again, grab my knife and end it all. I also have medication im going to down before i start to...attempt fully. If I live, I may (cant guarantee) re edit this post. Don't feel bad for me, I've wanted this. I ACTIVELY want this.

I really don't want to live anymore,"I've never talked about this with anyone, but I really don't want to live anymore. Because what is the point? Why am I here? I can't do anything useful in my life until I become an adult, I ruin almost everything, I cut a lot and am always worried someone will see the scars. I get confused when I see people genuinely enjoying themselves and having fun. It blows my mind. How are they so happy? How can anyone love themselves? I don't love myself. I'm fact I hate myself. Because I deserve it. What use am I to anyone? 

The answer is none. I'm not of any use. And you know why? It's because whenever I've tried to be useful I mess it up. So, what's the point? What the point of enduring an existence that I can't seem to enjoy? I haven't been diagnosed with depression, so I'm not going to claim that I have it. But, what other explanation is there? And even if that is the explanation, does it even matter? Does anything really matter?

To whoever read this all the way through, (I know this sounds cliche) thank you for reading my scattered thoughts and emotions. I hope you have a good day tomorrow.

I don't know if I can do it anymore,"So there was this girl that I've known since forever, but years ago I ended up having a major crush on her. After,  me and her started talking more and becoming close friends. We went for a few years of talking for a few months, her pushing away then a few months later texting me out of the blue and repeat. Almost 2 years ago we stared talking again and it was great. Her house every weekend doing stupid shit like watching Youtube videos, music, and Netfix till like 11 at night. We also ended up talking feelings stuff which I never do, like I'm an emotional guy, but I don't show it. But I kinda felt like I was like I was living for the weekends, that and spending time at lunch in school. Like we weren't dating, but we were super close friends and we had talked about how I felt about her, but she wasn't sure how she felt. After hanging out less and less for a few months, we graduated. That night she sent a text about how she felt and that I had pushed to much and we haven't talked since. That was about a year ago. I don't blame her, at the time I was scared of losing her and I just kept pushing. But it hasn't gotten any better I still miss her more than ever. I honestly feel like there is something wrong with me, holding on for so long, and I feel really lost not having her in my life. Part of really wants to try talking to her again, but I'm afraid that will just hurt her more than I already have. I don't want commit suicide, but I really don't want to exist.

My story - from happy to suicidal,"This all come downs to my boyfriend leaving me, in december 2019. Ive had a hard life, with a mother who was a drug addict when i was young, and a father who left when i was two. I have spent my whole childhood with my mother who became an alcoholic and have been, from when i was 8 years old, to today. Im 21. I have had all sorts of bad father figures in my life, cause my mom didnt chose the best men. Theyre all dead now. I met my bf in december 2014 (when i was 16), and he left me last december. The 5 years with him, was the best years in my life. He was my bestfriend, and my only friend. I have never been so happy. We had a dog together, which i now had to sell, cause i couldnt afford him alone. I feel like i have lost my whole world, and i now have nothing. Im very suicidal, and has been for 3 months. Ive written my notes to my family, now i just need to find the courage to do it. The memories of my ex haunts me every day. It was the best time of my life. We did everything together. He really was my ride or die. He left because he didnt have feelings for me anymore. Came out of no where. Ive told my therapist about my thoughts, but she doesent seem to take me very serious. I just wish i could stop existing. I dont want to live anymore, and everyday is a struggle. Im devasted about the fact that im gonna put my family through this, but the pain is to hudge.

I've been extremely suicidal lately and my friends left a care package on my front doorstep today,"Every single night it's been so hard just to exist and breathe and I have desperately wanted to end my life. Tonight I let my dog out and I saw a package on my doorstep and it was from a couple of friends that I haven't spoken to in a couple months who were worried about me. A bunch of doctor who stuff and star trek socks, literally everything that I would love. I cried when I opened it. I become so convinced that I'm worthless and I'm horrible to be around and I stop talking with people who actually care about me. I called them instantly and they weren't even mad that I haven't talked to them in so long. I wish I could tell them how much it means to me but I'm afraid to let people know that I've been suicidal because I don't want them to be worried.

"Heres my suicide note, Is there anyone who wants to talk?","Goodbye

I wish things could have gone differently, I hate every second of life. I hate every thought that I have, every breathe that I take and every piece of my life. I don’t want to suffer for the rest of my life, but I also don’t want others to suffer for my “selfish” choice. I hated growing up, abused, everyday insults 

for something that I didnt do. I hated going home and then going back to school feeling different and separated from everyone else. I rushed life, I didnt do anything important growing up, I had amazing friends that I love and who also are the reason that I’m still here. I was always told that I didnt know 

anything, and maybe I don’t, maybe this is a foolish choice, maybe theres a hell. I feel like my life is just going into a dead end. I hate college I dont even know what I want to do with my life, I feel like im wasting my time, but at the same time I feel like Im learning more about my self but why the fuck is it 

so hard? I have a chance to go the campus therapist, but for some reason i keep hesitating to call, its like I need someone to push me, but theres not going to be anyone, its just me alone in my dorm room. I just dont want to live anymore. I feel like Im worthless, I have zero value, I need someone.

I’m a failure and I’m sick of it,"Not gonna lie, I feel like a fucking dumbass typing this. But I’m failing at life, really want to die, and am too embarrassed to explain to the people closest to me that I would rather die than proceed with my futile attempts at life. So here I am, on reddit, for some unknown fucking reason. I guess I just need to vent and this seems like the best place because I’m sure no one I know will look here. So here it goes

I’m 23. Live in my parents basement with an amazing girl that I really don’t deserve. Most of my life I’ve been the quiet kid. Most people were scared of me in school because of that, but I’m too much of a pussy to actually do anything. Only reason anyone would talk to me was because I played football and went to school with most of my team. 

From elementary school through middle school I was really fucking ugly. Acne was terrible, huge fucking nose, no confidence. Had like 2 encounters with girls during this time period and I was a hardcore “nice guy.” Those 2 encounters were enough for everyone to realize I’m pretty fucking retarded. So most people avoided me. High school I peaked. (and by peak I really don’t mean much. Just the time that I wasn’t absolutely pathetic) Met the girl I’m with now, got in really good shape and did pretty good in football. Managed to get fucking C’s all throughout though so I got no scholarship for college. 

After high school my parents were amazing enough to pay for my college. 5000 fucking dollars a semester for me to do average my first semester then fail calculus my second semester. After my second semester I let my father convince me that I should go to school closer to home and do electrical engineering. First semester I did average. Next semester I failed fucking Chemistry and lab. Semester after that I failed my chemistry lab again so I had to switch to Computer engineering. Semester after that I failed Pde’s. Pretty much every semester after that I’ve failed classes. Not because I’m not learning the material but because I’m so fucking lazy I don’t do half the homework. Usually my homework grades suck but my test scores are good but not good enough to keep me from failing. Every year my parents keep telling me that they are going to make me move out and pay for my own school, but they keep giving me more chances and I keep royal fucking those chances. Honestly don’t understand why they give me so many chances. 

Anyways, this year isn’t any different. Last semester I took 3 fucking classes (9 credit hours) and failed all three of my classes. Worst I’ve ever done. So this current semester I’m retaking 2 of the 3 I failed and just had to withdraw from one of them and the other I will probably get a C in. I don’t get it. I have a part time job at fucking Chili’s, I live at home, have everything going for me; don’t have to worry about expenses, amazing girlfriend, family that loves me. Yet I can’t fucking pass two fucking classes.

I’m a failure. Honestly no other explanation. I get to tell my mother that after this semester I am dropping out and moving out, therefore waisting 50,000$ of her money. Thing is, if I can’t pass two fucking classes how the fuck an I suppose to live on my own. Other thing is, I wouldn’t be on my own, my girlfriend would be with me which makes everything worse because I would be dragging her down with me. So instead of moving out I have decided I should probably just kill myself. I’ve planned it out for the most part. I have a 30-06 in my room that guarantees my death, I’ve scouted a place out where no one will be able to find my corpse. I haven’t written my goodbye letter because I’m honestly too pathetic to write one and probably won’t even leave one, I plan on depositing all of my money into an account that my girlfriend has access to so she can get out of this house as quickly as possible if need be, etc...

I know my death will negatively impact those closest too me but I’m almost positive my parents will get over it. Honestly my father has given up on me so I don’t think he’ll care much. My grandparents will be devastated but they will get over it.
Only one I’m worried about is my girlfriend. She’s about to start a new job right when I plan on killing myself and I don’t want to ruin that. I’m sure I can figure something out.

At the same time. I really don’t want to die. It still breaks my heart that I have to leave everything behind. My family has two amazing dogs that I would die for, I managed to go out with a girl way out of my league for 5 years that’s about to get a job relevant to her dream career, I have grandparents, aunts, and uncles that all seem to like me, etc...

Guess I’ll just bring a couple bottles to try and get over that heartbreak so I can pull the trigger.

Anyways, sorry to start my own fucking pity party. It was just hurting me to not say or write anything before I die since I’ve done relatively good at hiding my depression from everyone.

Almost,"So I’ve been depressed since about 4. Started cutting around 12, the same time I had my first flashback to the first time I was raped. I made serval attempts since I was 16, never really trying hard enough. But tonight I really really really wanted to do it. I tried cutting myself but the knife I got wasn’t sharp enough... my boyfriend ended up calling me in the middle of everything. So I talked to him about it, I was on hold with the suicide hotline anyways.

I guess I didn’t REALLY want to otherwise it would’ve worked? I’ve always heard of people just cutting, but it ends up going too deep and that’s how they almost die. Don’t know why I’m writing this.. actually I do I want to hear from someone. Encouragement, your story, anything.

guilt,"I've been suicidal in the past and really thought I was better. For some reason started thinking about all the bad/hurtful things I've done to people and within like a week went from feeling generally good to researching ways to kill myself. I feel like a shit person and like there's no good reason for me to live. I just want to stop feeling guilty and I don't know how to do that except kill myself. And I feel like I would kind of deserve it.

I'm scared that even if I make it through this I'm just doomed to being suicidal all my life and eventually I'll be impulsive enough to do it. Even just thinking this way makes me feel guilty because I know how much being suicidal hurts and scares my friends and family.

Gonna kill myself after prom,"I’ve been suffering from depression and anxiety since like 8th grade. I was molested when I was younger which definitely doesn’t help but honestly I just wanna kill myself cause of my current situation. I just feel so lonely and just downright defeated honestly. I thought I’ve been getting better but realized that I’m actually just regressing in different ways. Instead of being sad about my problems I laugh them off and ignore them leaving them there, instead of being too open with my friends driving them away I now have serious problems not being able to express that I care about people. It’s to the point that apparently (someone else pointed this out) I physically shake when I begin talking about anything wrong with myself. I’m so fucking sick of this you’d think of after 4 YEARS of consistently fighting and trying everything (medicine, mediation, therapy) NOTHING has been accomplished. I always feel like an outsider looking in, never really belonging. Sometimes I think my friends secretly don’t like me and I don’t blame them. How could you like someone who can’t express that they care about you. Never been in an actual relationship, to the point to where when my entire workplace realized I probably wasn’t going to prom so my friend volunteered to go with me which to me feels like a complete pity act as she does have a boyfriend. So I think my current plans are I’ll take this last month to get everything in place, have a great time at prom, and overdose on something (probably alcohol). College life and adult work don’t seem my speed anyways.

Feeling my life is over,"Hey, I created an account because I honestly dont know what I am doing anymore on here. Last year was the worst of my life. My long time GF (4  years) and I broke up. She lives in a different state so I flew there to speak to her and atleast end it on good terms. The day after I started a new job. 

It started well with my manager happy but the next week I had another manager who joined (the person who hired me was sacked). Towards the end of the first month, I ended up having surgery on my back. This is where the issues started, The surgery and the breakup really affected me physically and mentally and I kept making errors which were easily avoidable.  Eventually it got too much for them and they released me.  

It took me 3 years to find the job in my field which I graduated in and i honestly thought it was what I was looking for. Unfortunately, I got left with no job and now no partner. 

I have a job now - in my field but not exactly the same (if that makes sense) but it is really going nowhere. My manager is good and is happy  with my performance but the organisation does not allow for any growth. The person who I replaced is younger than me and is already far ahead in their career than I will. To top it all off, I live in a small town and it will be hard to hide the termination.

Boyfriend's classmate jumped off a 6 story parking garage yesterday,"He wrote a note and everything. Nobody knew a thing, he was so successful, athletic, smart, social. He was friends with everyone. All my boyfriend can say is how depressing the air at school is, how low everyone is, how it just hit everyone. This person took their own life. They're gone.

All I can think about is myself. How many times I've attempted it and failed. How much of an asshole I am for wanting to put that suffering onto others, and yet how much I want my death to impact people. I feel like I'm not suffering bad enough if I don't kill myself. At the same time, I'm convinced suicide is no longer even an option taken how many times I've survived.

This other kid was so strong, so brave and so powerful that he was able to leap 6 stories up to his death. He wrote an elaborate note. He kept his mouth shut about his inner turmoils and nobody knew a thing. On the other end is me, I've done nothing but fail at everything including trying to kill myself, and I feel like my only personality trait is my trauma. Everyone knows I'm depressed, because I can't help but overshare. I feel like I burden loved ones with my thoughts and feelings. And I can't do it.

I need help.,"I can't count how many times I've tried reaching out on reddit, each time to no avail. I have no idea where else to go or what else to do. I hope someone can say something that is helpful in the slightest for once.

I can't afford to see an actual psychologist or psychiatrist. I recently discovered a place in my city that offers free counselling for certain people. After a few weeks of consideration and paranoia I finally sucked it up and went there to inquire. I almost felt proud of myself for taking that step. Then I found out there's a four month waitlist.  Fuck that. I can't wait that long. I need help now.

I live in a broken, poor city with little opportunity. I can't afford to move away. I was neglected by my parents as a child and abused as a teen. I never had a true parental figure. I have no idea what the hell I'm doing with my life. Thoughts of suicide began when I was eleven years old. I've tried to hang myself once with a belt but it broke. I have no true family aside from my grandmother. The only friends I have are long distance ones whom I met on the internet years ago and only talk to every month or so. Every romantic relationship I've been in has gone to shit by my own actions. I've developed a strong hatred for most of the people in my life as well as myself.

Overwhelming thoughts of suicide and the pain of loneliness severely hinders my ability to get anything done. I try to sit down to work on things but it just doesn't happen. I just can't. My memory has gone to shit. I can barely remember much of my childhood anymore and I probably won't remember much of what you say to me 20 minutes after you say it. My focus is non-existent. I've been having a lot of difficulty reading because I just can't focus on the words. I am currently unemployed and job-searching is horrible. My resume is pathetic. I didn't graduate high school. I hardly eat anymore and when I do it's usually cheap unhealthy food. My good habits slipped and now I hardly brush my teeth. I haven't been to the dentist in over a year but I can just feel the cavities. I lost the one thing that kept me trying to move forward. The one thing that gave me hope of a future. Now I can't see myself anywhere in the future.

There's nothing for me here. I feel so alone. Everyday I fantasize about pulling out the big chef's knife and driving it through my throat one or ten times. I just don't have the desire to go on. I know that not everyone is supposed to make it. Not everyone can make it. I genuinely feel like I am one of those people. But a small part of me still wants to live.

I don't know if anyone will see this or care enough to respond. If you do respond, please just don't say generic copy-pasted shit.

Im 14 and struggling a lot.,"Ive been depressed for a couple of years now, ive been suicidal too for the past 3 years. One of the main reasons is my family. I’m an outsider to them, i chose that i don’t want to be religious or what they wanted me to be. They tried to mould me into the model son, i hate it. Ive spoke on to a lot of people online, who’ve become my close friends, but in the beginning of this year, i lost my closest friend, of 3 years. He was an inspiration to me, and now that he’s gone i feel alone. I have friends still but they slowly drift further each coming day.

Recently, i was telling dark jokes as a coping mechanism, it helps relieve stress when i make jokes about stuff. I slipped up and made a joke that offended a girl in my class, she went to the head of student affairs in my school and complained about me, despite having apologised at least 5 times. Parents got involved too, and news spreads like wildfire. I don’t feel like going to school tomorrow, because the last thing i want is this stress from my peers.

Its not my peers that are the problem though, it’s my family. They’re religious and believe you should never joke about the stuff i do. (I still joke about the things i do because my mental state has deteriorated). I have depression, insomnia and ptsd. My family doesn’t know. In about an hour i have to either confess everything that’s wrong, which’ll probably give me shit to deal with x20 worse, or i can kill myself today. Im heavily weighing the options. I don’t want to live, to suffer, anymore. I’ve attempted in the past and i pussied out in the last moments. But this time, if i have to, i will. I can’t live like this anymore. I’d probably get disowned if i called the child support hotline, and i go to a private school on an academic scholarship, so i’ll have to move schools, which’d mean i’d lose my closest friends in real life.

Im pretty much failing every class, flunking every class, i don’t do work anymore, im constantly in pain. My head thumps everyday with migraines and i cant focus, i can only stay sane from my dogs and music. Im in love with videogames, but my pc died last september so i havent been able to play and it made me really sad. 

I just want some incentive to live, to keep going, but i cant see anything but my future going dim. I’m in school typing this out. Im hoping by some insane luck that i can make it through this. I promised myself that depending how my year started out, i’d contemplate suicide. I decided that i would do it in feb but didnt, so i want to do it today. Idk how i’ll make it through this.

Live vicariously through me,"I think about suicide all the time. I am sooooo broke, depressed, and now live in my car even though I work a full time job and do side gigs. I am my grandmothers sponsor therefore I’m financially responsible for her. It’s the only reason I’m alive. If I was gone, no one would be pay for her assisted living or even watch out for her. I love her and resent her. I’ve been thinking about suicide ever since I can remember. I don’t even remember the last time I was actually even semi happy but I’m stuck because I love her. 

If this wasn’t the case and I actually had some money, I’d go far far away. Somewhere like Tuvalu where people actually seem to care about each other. Where life moves slow and not everything involves so much technology and material things. I think that’d be the one thing that could help me with my suicidal thoughts.. just completely changing my life. 

But I can’t do that, so if you have the means to do so, why don’t you try? Don’t move to a different city.. move to a different continent. If you are planning to kill yourself, move somewhere else. Change everything. You have nothing to lose and maybe just maybe you’ll actually be happy to Alive and if so, I’d love to live vicariously through you.",ineedsleep799,3,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/fdrp1n/live_vicariously_through_me/,think suicide time sooooo broke depressed live car even though work full time job side gig grandmother sponsor therefore financially responsible reason alive wa gone one would pay assisted living even watch love resent thinking suicide ever since remember even remember last time wa actually even semi happy stuck love case actually money go far far away somewhere like tuvalu people actually seem care life move slow everything involves much technology material thing think one thing could help suicidal thought completely changing life mean try move different city move different continent planning kill move somewhere else change everything nothing lose maybe maybe actually happy alive love live vicariously,live vicariously,need sleep 799,1231,27,need sleep 799 think suicide time sooooo broke depressed live car even though work full time job side gig grandmother sponsor therefore financially responsible reason alive wa gone one would pay assisted living even watch love resent thinking suicide ever since remember even remember last time wa actually even semi happy stuck love case actually money go far far away somewhere like tuvalu people actually seem care life move slow everything involves much technology material thing think one thing could help suicidal thought completely changing life mean try move different city move different continent planning kill move somewhere else change everything nothing lose maybe maybe actually happy alive love live vicariously live vicariously
"do you ever feel like you're always alone, even when surrounded by others?","you know how people always say ""you're lonely, not alone""? i really honestly feel like i'm just unable to become close to another human being - mutually.

i have a lot of people in my life who love me and want to be close to me. but i feel cold saying that i am either too overwhelmed by them or i don't feel close to them.

i cant bond with others anymore. i used to have stupid useless sex constantly that made me feel like a piece of meat to be consumed. now intimacy terrifies me.

closeness and hugs scare me. i'm extremely isolated and i only ever leave the house for my (extremely tough medical) school and to get food. debt is piling up because of that but its my only joy.

i cant stand people getting close to me. i cant stand hanging out with friends. but yet i want love and intimacy so badly. i feel like im so broken, and that i'm never going to feel like a human again.

i just feel like a vessel that serves as a stupid, servicing fleshlight to fuck. to only ever improve the quality of others - not me. i don't deserve it.

i just don't understand why i shouldn't just kill myself over spring break. that way if i survive, i have a week to be in the psych hospital and not miss any assignments or exams.",disasterwizard,1,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/fdp5eu/do_you_ever_feel_like_youre_always_alone_even/,know people always say lonely alone really honestly feel like unable become close another human mutually lot people life love want close feel cold saying either overwhelmed feel close cant bond others anymore used stupid useless sex constantly made feel like piece meat consumed intimacy terrifies closeness hug scare extremely isolated ever leave house extremely tough medical school get food debt piling joy cant stand people getting close cant stand hanging friend yet want love intimacy badly feel like im broken never going feel like human feel like vessel serf stupid servicing fleshlight fuck ever improve quality others deserve understand kill spring break way survive week psych hospital miss assignment exam,ever feel like always alone even surrounded others,disaster wizard,1220,74,disaster wizard know people always say lonely alone really honestly feel like unable become close another human mutually lot people life love want close feel cold saying either overwhelmed feel close cant bond others anymore used stupid useless sex constantly made feel like piece meat consumed intimacy terrifies closeness hug scare extremely isolated ever leave house extremely tough medical school get food debt piling joy cant stand people getting close cant stand hanging friend yet want love intimacy badly feel like im broken never going feel like human feel like vessel serf stupid servicing fleshlight fuck ever improve quality others deserve understand kill spring break way survive week psych hospital miss assignment exam ever feel like always alone even surrounded others

Does cutting help?,"Hey, I have a question for anyone who’s willing to answer. I just would like to know if anyone who has cut in the past, and who maybe are still cutting, does it help you in any way? Does it relive any sort of distress? I know it’s a dangerous game to play. I’m just curious. Cheers everyone! I hope you all stay in this life and continue to at least try to conquer your demons. You might not think you are loved, but you are loved by someone, and you might just be wanting someone to ask if you are ok. Milking yourself ends ANY sort of progression to get better.

Your aren't bad,"Feeling this way isn't a bad thing. Something that is said to much in our society is that feeling suicidal if a bad thing. The whole ""don't do it,"" line is just a rewording of our society sentiment towards suicide. You should just know that feeling suicidal, even to the point of writing notes and making plans isn't a bad thing. There is no shame in falling when you've been beaten. Feeling suicidal is a perfectly natural response to abuse, depression, psychosis, or any other horrible thing; you can't go near a fire without getting hot. There is nothing wrong with you for feeling suicidal, for feeling like you hate yourself. Maybe the reason you hate yourself is because you've never been loved, so you see no proof that you are worthy of any. Maybe it's because you have been abusedv so thoroughly you've been programmed to hate yourself. No matter the cause, I cannot stress this enough, it is not a bad thing.

Saved by my dog,"I'm in a pretty bad place right now, and suicidal again after months of feeling ""better"".
Yesterday was one of my lowest this year. I was going to take pills and alcohol, as much as I could handle. The bottle was in my hands, when I heard my dog about to vomit.
I got up to clean it and she was stumbling around, and then passed out. I got so desperate, took her on my arms and walked 15min to the closest clinic.
I didn't even remember my plans till I got home with her at night.

She had a bunch of exams made, and is on meds and relatively better. I keep thinking that if I had took the pills I would've been at least incredibly high, and wouldn't be able to help her.

I would like to erase everything... Help,"Hello everyone,

I just don't know where to start... I'm feeling really helpless to be honest. I feel like a burden, like a parasite. Every day, pain is with me. Joy is temporary. I surrender at this point. My childhood has been a mess with my dysfunctional parents. I've never been good. If you want to have an idea, my mother has a borderline personality disorder, which means she was violent, physically and emotionally. My father is narcissistic, he abused me emotionally, making me feel like a burden. Never keeping his promises. I've never been happy for a long time with them. I'd say, for my life, 10% happy, 90% in pain. Now I'm 21, I don't know how I survived at this point, but I reached my limit. I tried to take my life away, wasn't a success. My family learned it, and for a moment I thought they finally considered me, but it was for such a short amount of time. I'm always walking on eggs with my parents. I'm in university right now, and it's hard. I just don't have the energy and will to persevere. My energy level is low, very low. I've tried therapy, meds, taking walks, doing sports. But every time I feel like I finally got my life together, something happens and it goes down. For example, I thought I could have some hope two weeks ago, then my cat died. She was my real family, I really loved her and she was always there for me, she kinda helped me a lot with her caring presence. It destroyed me. Then I tried again, but now I've got issues again with the parents. I'm exhausted. I don't have the strength to continue this life. I'm helpless. I sincerely considered ending everything this week.

I want to pursue death but I am not depressed nor suicidal,"Hello. Never really wrote about myself online but I’m very curious and the stigma behind death seems to discourage discussion of it. I’ve actively tried talking to my family and a therapist about my perception of my life but their inability to understand that it does not and never has stemmed from depression irritates me. 

I want to die. I believe that death is the ultimate end goal for every single human being and rapidly increasing its approach would lead me to the end. Please note, I have a social life. I have close friends at college and at work. I also have a pretty active socia life (I go to a couple parties here and there). I’m in a solid relationship (been together for two years now), and I do not abuse drugs or alcohol, only at kick backs or something. I do not have depression, I’m pretty laid back down to earth guy who has never had any mental illness nor any thoughts of worthlessness, extreme sadness etc. 

Personally, the meaningless within life is the main motivator for my methodology. Realistically, the now is true living (due to its value, the past you can’t change and the future is unknown). Past the now, life is to be, not happening. Work, sex, love, entertainment, etc. are used to keep individuals living but what for? We work a 9-5 job, we have kids, we do all of these things and yet the reasoning boils down to survival and entertainment. entertainment to keep us looped within an endless cycle of netflix shows or games or tv shows or youtube and survival of work to eat and feed the future generation. realistically, love is a chemical compound effect which sparks to motivate the production of kids. to continue the species. the love of a parent to a child is to prevent child hood death so the child can become a parent and produce more children for the cycle to continue. when you really boil down what life is it’s just an endless cycle of continuation within a species. 

Idk i’m just curious if anyone else feels this way. You develop your own meaning in life but that meaning isn’t even yours. You are taught that meaning through society and social interactions. Your parents develop that meaning for you and you believe it’s yours but in reality it isn’t. The pursuit of a good job or a big house or to produce music or to be a serial killer all of these perceptions you learn from society in which you incorporate into your definition of life. how you want to live isn’t even your own perception it’s just a jumble of social expectations mixed into you.

If anyone can help me understand this it’d be a great help. I just want to know why life has meaning and why we live if not for social pressures, a biological barrier which prevents self harm, your “personal” meaning, etc.",3Yawns,12,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/fdotci/i_want_to_pursue_death_but_i_am_not_depressed_nor/,hello never really wrote online curious stigma behind death seems discourage discussion actively tried talking family therapist perception life inability understand doe never ha stemmed depression irritates want die believe death ultimate end goal every single human rapidly increasing approach would lead end please note social life close friend college work also pretty active socia life go couple party solid relationship together two year abuse drug alcohol kick back something depression pretty laid back earth guy ha never mental illness thought worthlessness extreme sadness etc personally meaningless within life main motivator methodology realistically true living due value past change future unknown past life happening work sex love entertainment etc used keep individual living work 9 5 job kid thing yet reasoning boil survival entertainment entertainment keep u looped within endless cycle netflix show game tv show youtube survival work eat feed future generation realistically love chemical compound effect spark motivate production kid continue specie love parent child prevent child hood death child become parent produce child cycle continue really boil life endless cycle continuation within specie idk curious anyone else feel way develop meaning life meaning even taught meaning society social interaction parent develop meaning believe reality pursuit good job big house produce music serial killer perception learn society incorporate definition life want live even perception jumble social expectation mixed anyone help understand great help want know life ha meaning live social pressure biological barrier prevents self harm personal meaning etc,want pursue death depressed suicidal,3 yawn,2729,58,3 yawn hello never really wrote online curious stigma behind death seems discourage discussion actively tried talking family therapist perception life inability understand doe never ha stemmed depression irritates want die believe death ultimate end goal every single human rapidly increasing approach would lead end please note social life close friend college work also pretty active socia life go couple party solid relationship together two year abuse drug alcohol kick back something depression pretty laid back earth guy ha never mental illness thought worthlessness extreme sadness etc personally meaningless within life main motivator methodology realistically true living due value past change future unknown past life happening work sex love entertainment etc used keep individual living work 9 5 job kid thing yet reasoning boil survival entertainment entertainment keep u looped within endless cycle netflix show game tv show youtube survival work eat feed future generation realistically love chemical compound effect spark motivate production kid continue specie love parent child prevent child hood death child become parent produce child cycle continue really boil life endless cycle continuation within specie idk curious anyone else feel way develop meaning life meaning even taught meaning society social interaction parent develop meaning believe reality pursuit good job big house produce music serial killer perception learn society incorporate definition life want live even perception jumble social expectation mixed anyone help understand great help want know life ha meaning live social pressure biological barrier prevents self harm personal meaning etc want pursue death depressed suicidal

I can’t handle my thoughts anymore.,"I was brutally raped for 2 months. By my best friends boyfriend. My best friend died of cancer. A month later her boyfriend messaged me saying he just needed a friend. I went over that night to his place. I regret ever doing that. He drugged and raped me. The next morning he threatened me. Told me if I didn’t keep giving him what he wanted he would kill me and himself. I was terrified. 

For 2 months every day I let him abuse and rape me. Out of fear. I eventually started to get myself so drunk I’d just pass out.

I'm running out of ways to fight back.,"I've been doing the only thing I'm capable of to hold myself in place at this point, which is doing everything I can to ignore it all. My feelings, my life, the dread that comes every single fucking night.


I've been overeating to the point of getting sick. I've been spending days and more days barely taking care of myself, and just existing in my home, from which I barely leave for days on end.


I've been avoiding this conclusion forever, mostly because I'm so scared of it.


I don't think I want to exist. Every single night I try really hard to dream and fantasize about my deepest desires, in a desperate attempt to find a reason to pull myself up and keep going, but lately, I've been giving up so easily. I feel like nothing's is really worth it, and that includes myself. The thought of just ending it keeps coming over and over again, and it's getting harder and harder to fight back.


I'm scared. I feel cold and worthless. But what's worse is that I know tomorrow will be exactly the same.


I know there are people who love me and do so much for me, and I appreciate every single second they invest on me... But I've been really afraid of the idea that, even tho they try to, they can't really change things or help me in the ways that really matter in the end, like my mental condition, my traumas and the inescapable barrier that is my social class.

"I want to kill myself, but don't want ex-girlfriend to feel bad","(25M) I've been dealing with depression since I was about 14. I've been to countless therapists/doctors and have never had any relief. Throughout that time I've battled the urge to end my life and the only thing that seems to stop me is the guilt of hurting my family, in particular my mum.

I feel like such an ungrateful piece of garbage for what I've put her though and I know she deserves better than me.

She unfortunately isn't the only one. I recently ended it with my girlfriend because I couldn't stand what I was doing to her emotionally, the burden of having to deal with me day after day is exhausting and its simply not fair to ask that of her.

I've had gfs in the past but she is the only one I've ever truly loved, I genuinely believe that she is/was the one, but I can't condemn her to a life with me.
She simply deserves better. She's the most wonderful person I've ever known, and she should be with someone who can make her happy.

I wish she hated me, so that she doesn't feel guilt or sadness when I die.

I had a nightmare last night about my past,"I have been crying for the whole morning. I could not take it anymore. I had a horrible nightmare about my life. It was telling me who was my real parent.
I am an orphan and my adoptive parent never told me this. My dad and his family constantly abused me and my mon when I was kid. They said we both poor and from uneducated family. We were filthy peasant. After my mom died he and his family told me to marry a rich man and didn't matter if I became a hidden wife, second wife of an old man. He told me I was different from normal girl I didnt deserve a good life.
It was discovered two years ago that I was adopted.
Neither my mom or my dad are my biological parent.
And in my country it is a shame, an orphan usually treated very bad and deserved to be a maid.

"A girl I knew commit suicide, now I want to","Preface, I'm a bit drunk rn, it helps numb this pain.

A girl I knew and I had hooked up with in the past, then became friends with commit suicide recently. We weren't close but I'd consider her a special friend to me. We rarely saw each other, but when we did we had the best banter known to man.  


I'm doing great in school, have a girlfriend, got internships lined up and was happy before this. But now, since she commit suicide, the only thing that makes sense to me is to kill myself. I've had depressive episodes before but this feels different. Everytime my thoughts are blank or I zone out, my first thought is the fact she is actually gone. Last time I tried to commit suicide was 5 years ago, and even then it wasn't this impactful.

&amp;#x200B;

For some reason this girl's suicide has really fucked with me and makes me feel like suicide is a reasonable option. It makes me feel like I have a new purpose. I feel like there is something extraordinary waiting for me. I almost feel as if she is waiting for me.

&amp;#x200B;

I got home in a cab and cried the entire way. The cab driver said nothing. I said nothing. When he looked at me I felt he had accepted my fate as I had. Perhaps there is more, perhaps there isn't. But I do want to cry more, but I'm not close enough to the girl to deserve pity.

&amp;#x200B;

As I am typing this out I feel better.  I feel as if I do not need to die right now but I do crave death. Just not at my hand. I accept being murdered, I accept an accident.

"I don't have anyone else to burden with this, so","I feel really weird doing this. I'm not good at talking about this stuff. But I have a couple reasons to think unloading anonymously might help a little.

I've been dealing with depression and suicidal thoughts for about half my life, since I was in middle school. Had a couple close calls, but had my first genuine attempt last summer. I've been in and out of various treatments since then. Lost my job and most of my friends. Buried in medical debt. Lost my car today.

I was struggling even when things were going well, but now I'm out of straws to grasp at. I don't like myself. I don't even respect myself. I'm embarrassed of the life I've lived. I can't keep myself sober, and, frankly, I'm out of reasons to bother trying. I like to say I won't make another attempt because of my dad, but some days I think the real reason is because I just haven't stockpiled enough pills yet.

This is hard for me to type. I feel like I'm just an attention seeker. And, hey, maybe I am. I don't know. I don't even feel like I should be posting here. I'm not really an immediate threat to myself. I'm just desperate. This is the hardest night I've had in a while.

I’m leaving tomorrow,"For years ive been depressed and taking medication. The one thing keeping me going has been my familys encouragement and love. All my life i grew up to please my parents and do what they wanted. I realised later on that i couldnt keep doing that. I tried to kill myself then but was caught. Its been five years since then and my parents have been so loving. They tell me they dont care what i will be in the future as long as im happy. And that was what kept me going. 

A few days ago i found out from my brother that our dad told him that he compares us to the other kids his officemates boast about. He says he cant help it. He says he knows its wrong but that we cant blame him. He says he went wrong with us. With me. It shattered me

Now as im writing this, i have almost everythimg ready to go tomorrow. The last time i wa s going to die i was desperate and grieving. Now im angry and sad and theres nothing left. No matter what option i have left. I will fail. I will never be what my parents love and are proud of. They lied to me all these 5 years. I know they love me. But now i know they pity me and think im a defect produced by their parenting. 

If anyone i know finds this, please know its not your fault. I will never hate anyone more than myself. Im a coward. ive always known. To my brother, i want you to have everything i own. You can choose to throw it away or give it away. The plushies can go to dad, the makeup can go to mom. The clothes can be sold. The rest is yours. Im sorry i couldnt be the sister you admire

Yesterday I turned 25 and I still wonder how I made it this far.,"I was the only thing that held their marriage or some sort together. Came to them today to have a family dinner tomorrow and they do nothing but arguing between each other over stupid shit. Guess they are so tired of each other they ain’t even faking it.

Yesterday I had a birthday party with my friends. Of course it was great, but it was mainly an attempt for me to get some Dopamine™️ through people I considered friends. We live together and I try to do shit that would bind me with them. Simple stuff, like cooking a bit, doing common household chores around the kitchen and common places, going to the drugstore when someone’s sick or stuff. But there’s no feedback. When I ask them something about where is something like a bag for cold food (don’t know how it’s called, a bag where you put frozen stuff when going to the grocery store) no one batted an eye and helped me to find it. Asked someone (by text) to get me instant ramen in store and them “Whoops, sorry, guess I forgot”. 

Same with my work. I’m treated like an everyman when almost everyone constantly forgets about shit I ask them to do and rely on. 

I feel completely alone. Not like *alone* but with no person I can rely to. My close ones make me sick. Social interaction makes me sick. My work makes me sick. My constant struggle with my mental complications make me sick. My corrupted country makes me sick. The whole world makes me sick.

"I just need someone to talk to, man.","2020 is kicking my ass so bad. I got laid off in November, and a pregnancy wouldnt allow me to work until now. I got the call that im going back to work starting Saturday, but whats the use? Unemployment didnt pay enough to make rent and bills, social assistance wont help me BECAUSE im recieving Unemployment, and i was given the ""you have 14 days to pay your rent or i start the eviction process"" notice from the landlord. 
After waiting for a late payment of Unemployment to come in, and my husband and i taking everything of value to us (PS4, Switch, and even his guitar) to the pawn shop, we're a solid $60 short on rent with no income in sight for the remaining days we have to pay. 
I put my name out for emergency commissions as i figure people might go for it, but in all honesty, no one has. 
Another bomb dropped on me today was that this ""flu"" my 3 year old daughter has had for a few days now is actually Scarlet Fever. Who gets scarlet fever? Is this the 1800s? What happens if my newborn son catches it from her? Is this year the year i lose a child and face my biggest and deepest fear?

I can't take this anymore,"I can't fcking take this any longer, this post probably won't help me much but I'm so desperate that I'll try anything to have a glimpse of hope. I'm so confused that I can't even write a proper text begging for help, a very simple act can become so complex and overwhelming to me.  
I'll try to write this as coherent as possible but since english isn't my main language and I seem to have lost all my intelligence, so please forgive me if It starts getting confusing.

So basically, I have no idea what to do, my depression is getting so bad that I don't see any other way out besides ending it all. I feel no pleasure what so ever, not even masturbating gives me any pleasure. I feel like shit on a daily basis, from overwhelming sadness, anxiety and rage to paranoia, overwhelming suicidal thoughts and even homicidal thoughts. I don't want to hurt anyone besides myself thought. I'm such a failure, I'm 18 and still a virgin, I'm fat and all the freaking times I joined the gym I found myself just giving up weeks later. I have no social skills, or better yet no skills AT ALL. All my life I was illuded by my teachers, parents and friends into thinking that I was smarter than average, and the worst thing is that was the only good thing I saw on me, but I'm not smart at all, I'm just a dumb piece of shit. I tried everything I could to treat my depression but nothing seems to work, meditation (minimum of 30 minutes per day), medication (multiple antipsychotics, antidepressants and benzodiazepines), psychedelic drugs (LSD, magic mushrooms, DMT, you name it I probably tried it). I go to a psychologist and psychiatrist but I feel no better, probably worse than when it all started, the worst part is that I don't even remember when and how it started. Now I wouldn't say I abuse drugs that much, I mainly smoke a bit of weed every now and then, mostly weekends, and regarding psychedelics I done them rarely and with every bit of damage reduction I could think of, perhaps I did indeed disrespect them a bit (mostly taking them without prior planning leading to uncomfortable sets and settings) since I can't enjoy them anymore, I panic and my mind instantly tells me to take xanax or any benzo I can get my hands on. However I DID abuse Xanax, so much so that I ended up on the hospital a couple times for taking too much of it and blacking out, while in school which just fucked my reputation in school. My friends tried to help me as much as they could, but my mind is so fucked and confused that nothing seems to help. This text is getting long but I still have so much to say, I'll try to not make it too long so you don't get bored quickly. My grades are down the hill, I'm currently in 12th grade and about to fail, and honestly I CAN'T stand another year at that school, I rather hang myself than go through that again, specially since I live in an isolated island in the middle of nowhere and resources are very limited here, there's nothing to do here and there's no chance I'm getting a girlfriend here (or anywhere to be honest, nobody would love a fat piece of shit like me).

Life is unbearable, I see no reason to stay alive, all I do all day is playing fcking LoL and let me tell you I hate that game so much, makes my blood boil and gives me urges to just cut my wrists. I can't make basic math/physics/chemistry/etc.. which just makes me feel even worst, cuz I need it to get to college, but I don't understand shit in school, since I can't study or focus, my mind just bombards me with horrible thoughts that echo in my mind till I put myself to sleep, I have no control over my mind anymore. I started learning guitar, and ended up giving up. I tried to learn how to program, but It's too overwhelming and I'm starting to lose any motivation I had for it (not that I had much motivation in general).

Here's some backstory, when I was a kid I got shot in my eye with a air pressure carabine, which left me with about 10% vision on said eye, made me get fat cuz I couldn't do exercise for about 2-3 years and I ended up getting a bad lifestyle in general, all day in computer playing games. This combined with more trauma I went throught and my midly toxic family, lead to me becoming the disgusting person I could think of. I know this is getting too much information and confusing please forgive me, I'm retarded.

Right now all I can think of is how to kill myself, I've tried it before with pills but ended up failing, so this time I'm thinking of hanging myself, and will do it eventually.

Just thinking of all this makes my blood boil, I Hate life so much, I hate my fucking family, I hate my fucking school, I hate myself, I wanna shoot myself in the head and end it

Do the suicidal thoughts ever really end?,"I’ve been combatting them for years and they are so strong they prevent me from being a functional member of society. I’ve (sort of) attempted suicide twice within the last 8 years. And I wish I just went more balls deep with it when I did. 

I’ve been inpatient in mental hospitals, I’ve done IOP programs, PHP programs, DBT, CBT, etc. for over 13 years and even after following all of these things I’ve learned, the suicidal thoughts always win. I’ve been on prescription after prescription and some may help lessen the frequency but they never actually go away. 

I can’t tell my therapist (or any professional) these things because I’ll instantly be admitted. I’m already $1000+ in debt with medical bills from hospitalizations and therapy, and I can’t afford another useless admission. All hospitalizations are is just a cash grab and a reason to house suicidal people and bankrupt them while profiting off of their health insurance. 

I don’t even have the energy or willpower to go to work anymore. But my boss will fire me if I miss another day of work. But I can’t go to the doctors to get a doctor’s note or provide any excuse as to why I didn’t come in or else I’ll be hospitalized. I don’t care if I get evicted and lose my cats and all my belongings and have to live out of my car. I just can’t function in a work environment when feeling this way. 

It just feels like a vicious circle/catch 22 that I can’t seem to fucking break. Everyone around me just calls me weak and leaves me because I’m such a burden. I’ve always had this small fear in me of the “killing myself” process - the fear of feeling my skull hit the pavement if I jump off of a building; or the fear of feeling myself asphyxiating as a noose constricts all blood flow and airflow to my brain; or the fear of feeling all my organs shut down before my brain does if I overdose. But lately, those fears are becoming less and less of an issue where I’d rather just bite the bullet and be done with it.",UglyStru,2,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/fdrjax/do_the_suicidal_thoughts_ever_really_end/,combatting year strong prevent functional member society sort attempted suicide twice within last 8 year wish went ball deep inpatient mental hospital done iop program php program dbt cbt etc 13 year even following thing learned suicidal thought always win prescription prescription may help lessen frequency never actually go away tell therapist professional thing instantly admitted already 1000 debt medical bill hospitalization therapy afford another useless admission hospitalization cash grab reason house suicidal people bankrupt profiting health insurance even energy willpower go work anymore bos fire miss another day work go doctor get doctor note provide excuse come else hospitalized care get evicted lose cat belonging live car function work environment feeling way feel like vicious circle catch 22 seem fucking break everyone around call weak leaf burden always small fear killing process fear feeling skull hit pavement jump building fear feeling asphyxiating noose constricts blood flow airflow brain fear feeling organ shut brain doe overdose lately fear becoming le le issue rather bite bullet done,suicidal thought ever really end,ugly tru,1980,41,ugly tru combatting year strong prevent functional member society sort attempted suicide twice within last 8 year wish went ball deep inpatient mental hospital done iop program php program dbt cbt etc 13 year even following thing learned suicidal thought always win prescription prescription may help lessen frequency never actually go away tell therapist professional thing instantly admitted already 1000 debt medical bill hospitalization therapy afford another useless admission hospitalization cash grab reason house suicidal people bankrupt profiting health insurance even energy willpower go work anymore bos fire miss another day work go doctor get doctor note provide excuse come else hospitalized care get evicted lose cat belonging live car function work environment feeling way feel like vicious circle catch 22 seem fucking break everyone around call weak leaf burden always small fear killing process fear feeling skull hit pavement jump building fear feeling asphyxiating noose constricts blood flow airflow brain fear feeling organ shut brain doe overdose lately fear becoming le le issue rather bite bullet done suicidal thought ever really end
He cancelled our wedding 4 months away from the date...,"I dont know what to do anymore. I was 4 months away from getting married to my best friend of 10 yrs! He says he doesn't know what he wants . Everything was fine. He was actively planning the wedding with me, calling me his fiancee and handing out save the dates. He says he needs time, so I left the house and next week it'll be 1 month of our separation. Everyone is saying ""its better that it happened now vs later"" but it still hurts like hell. I ask for a reason to all of this and he says he doesnt know himself. He posts on instagram that he had to use 100% of his energy to let me go and that i will be happier with someone else. But the thing is I dont want anyone else and i will always choose him. I told him that and he doesnt say anything except not to push him. I love him so much and my heart feels like its going to explode and i feel like dying everyday! I know there are worse things that are happening in the world, and i feel stupid for saying this but i would rather die than to be without him. Not all relationships are perfect, yes we had our issues but we always found a way to work it out. This time around it really CAME OUT OF NO WHERE, it literally blindsided me. I feel crushed and i find myself just going through the motions as to not alarm my family, but I just cant do it anymore. I need my best friend back, I need the love of my life back....I cant tell anyone how i feel because they instantly tell me he is an idiot for leaving you and that i will find someone else. But i dont want anyone else.

Pretty high rn and just wanna empty some thoughts somewhere,"I hate who I am. I've lived a perfectly good life, had loving parents, was never bullied, whatever. Right now I have plenty of friends, a decent social life. I have no excuse for feeling how I feel and I just constantly beat myself up for it. Yet here we are, me just doing drugs every night and eating shitty food in the hopes that they'll kill me faster. Pretty much given up on college, no clue how I'm ever gonna graduate, but not like it matters since I'm not doing anything with my life anyway. Next phase is to get some dead end job till death finally comes. Not much to look forward to. Would have offed myself long ago if it wasn't for my parents, I can't give them the pain of losing their only child to suicide. I also don't wanna hurt my friends, but I'm doing a pretty good job of distancing myself from them so that probably won't be an issue in the future. Living for others sucks, but I mean, what other choice do I have?  I'm definitely not gonna live for myself when the time comes.

So here I am just patiently waiting death. For the most part I've stopped feeling anything. Some days (today) it just hits me like a train, but I usually wake up, just lumber through the whole day doing what's ""expected"" of me, all fake smiles and funny jokes to make people think that I'm normal. Then I come back, waste time with videos games or drugs, sleep, rinse and repeat. I've tried to start a hobby, but I always lose motivation, try to talk to people, but only exchange empty words. Don't see my condition improving in any way (not like it's possible anyway). Life sucks, it always has and always will. I just really hope that I don't get the chance to make it to 30 years.

I despise this cycle, I hate that you're forced to participate, and I hate that people tell you that you're the one with ""a problem"" for thinking that things shouldn't be this way. Isn't it cruel to keep someone in misery when relief is so easily available? But of course, forcing them to suffer is obviously the moral choice here. So I guess suffer I will, cause apparently society decided that this was the right choice. 

In short, all I'm looking forward to is the day that I'll be able to kill myself guilt free, hope it'll come sooner rather than later.",MatchaPrecciated,3,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/fdr9l9/pretty_high_rn_and_just_wanna_empty_some_thoughts/,hate lived perfectly good life loving parent wa never bullied whatever right plenty friend decent social life excuse feeling feel constantly beat yet drug every night eating shitty food hope kill faster pretty much given college clue ever gonna graduate like matter since anything life anyway next phase get dead end job till death finally come much look forward would offed long ago parent give pain losing child suicide also wanna hurt friend pretty good job distancing probably issue future living others suck mean choice definitely gonna live time come patiently waiting death part stopped feeling anything day today hit like train usually wake lumber whole day expected fake smile funny joke make people think normal come back waste time video game drug sleep rinse repeat tried start hobby always lose motivation try talk people exchange empty word see condition improving way like possible anyway life suck always ha always really hope get chance make 30 year despise cycle hate forced participate hate people tell one problem thinking thing way cruel keep someone misery relief easily available course forcing suffer obviously moral choice guess suffer cause apparently society decided wa right choice short looking forward day able kill guilt free hope come sooner rather later,pretty high rn wanna empty thought somewhere,matcha pre cci ted,2246,59,matcha pre cci ted hate lived perfectly good life loving parent wa never bullied whatever right plenty friend decent social life excuse feeling feel constantly beat yet drug every night eating shitty food hope kill faster pretty much given college clue ever gonna graduate like matter since anything life anyway next phase get dead end job till death finally come much look forward would offed long ago parent give pain losing child suicide also wanna hurt friend pretty good job distancing probably issue future living others suck mean choice definitely gonna live time come patiently waiting death part stopped feeling anything day today hit like train usually wake lumber whole day expected fake smile funny joke make people think normal come back waste time video game drug sleep rinse repeat tried start hobby always lose motivation try talk people exchange empty word see condition improving way like possible anyway life suck always ha always really hope get chance make 30 year despise cycle hate forced participate hate people tell one problem thinking thing way cruel keep someone misery relief easily available course forcing suffer obviously moral choice guess suffer cause apparently society decided wa right choice short looking forward day able kill guilt free hope come sooner rather later pretty high rn wanna empty thought somewhere
I won't be able to withstand this forever,"I just finished half of my current career... Pretty much four semesters, and almost nothing has changed.

Being honest, I've been trying to hold on for three and a half years after that Asperger misdiagnosis, but eventually it becomes unbearable... I keep thinking that some people treat me in a more child like way, or as if I were disabled, or just talking to me when we are face or face or for college stuff, but no more than that.

My mom has been trying to understand, but she says it's difficult, because she's a more self sufficient person, and she doesn't understand why I'm so obsessed with friendship.

Now I'll go to my psychologist in a few days, and I don't know how to make her understand as well... Sometimes, I think my problem isn't something that can be fixed by just believing in myself.

It's the main reason I want to die, it's the main reason I lost a lot of things and people in these past years... It destroyed my life, and I don't know how to make my mom and psychologist understand that.

I don't think I'll be able to withstand that forever. For now I can, but I feel that if the future will be the same, eventually I'll break down or have a nervous breakdown...

Believe me, it hurts to realize everything you lost, I know, it was my fault for saying it, I didn't know the consequences it would bring...

I'm tired of feeling like this, not being able to say what I really want to say to others, feeling treated like a child, trying to explain and almost no one understands...

I have nothing to live for. My mother is verbally abusive, and when I call out for help with the few close friends I have left, she says I'm lying and she'll call me out and ruin my life. Now, I don't even know if I'm lying or not. If I am, just ignore this then. I really don't know anymore. Everyday, I'm so confused. I have no right to be proud of anything, and because I go to a really tough high school, often I don't have the time to practice violin (but I do a lot of competitions and honor orch, etc. so yeah not good) and yanno, college applications are coming up and I don't think I have anything to show. I do homework during class so I can finally relax during lunch, but I tell my mom I do homework during lunch to avoid getting my ass kicked. She compulsively checks my phone and reads my texts (more than I have my phone, her reason is that my parents bought it and not me), goes through my stuff and takes it, then tells me she did nothing of the sort, and yet I'm the crazy horrible reputation ruining liar here. I guess I don't even know if I am?

I'm just so tired of it all. I know that there's things to look forward to and live for, but I feel nothing for it. I've had suicidal thoughts and depression and whatever and my mom is saying I'm lying and making it up. I just don't know what to do, because even though I'm just a teenager, I could probably say my boyfriend is the only person I'd want to spend life with if things work out (I've dated before and so has he). But as of now, I'm giving everyone aneurysms or something dealing with me and getting mad at me. My violin and sports are doing basically nothing because I don't have time or energy and this generation is pretty damn good at this stuff. The only thing keeping me alive is the fact that I know my boyfriend probably would have a really hard time dealing with the fact that I was gone, for a very long time. I've been debating ending the relationship to make it easier on him.

I'm sorry, I don't know what to ask of y'all. Just please help me. I'm talked out. I just don't know anymore. Everytime someone tries to help everything honestly just gets worse. I don't have the energy or the will to eat, or function, tbh.",emptywishes007,1,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/fdr971/please_help/,hey guy throwaway account reason anyways freshman high school overall pretty decent grade play violin since preschool sport extremely caring overall amazing boyfriend awesome friend basically consider older brother nothing live mother verbally abusive call help close friend left say lying call ruin life even know lying ignore really know anymore everyday confused right proud anything go really tough high school often time practice violin lot competition honor orch etc yeah good yanno college application coming think anything show homework class finally relax lunch tell mom homework lunch avoid getting kicked compulsively check phone read text phone reason parent bought go stuff take tell nothing sort yet crazy horrible reputation ruining liar guess even know tired know thing look forward live feel nothing suicidal thought depression whatever mom saying lying making know even though teenager could probably say boyfriend person want spend life thing work dated ha giving everyone aneurysm something dealing getting mad violin sport basically nothing time energy generation pretty damn good stuff thing keeping alive fact know boyfriend probably would really hard time dealing fact wa gone long time debating ending relationship make easier sorry know ask please help talked know anymore everytime someone try help everything honestly get worse energy eat function tbh,please help,empty wish 007,2523,11,empty wish 007 hey guy throwaway account reason anyways freshman high school overall pretty decent grade play violin since preschool sport extremely caring overall amazing boyfriend awesome friend basically consider older brother nothing live mother verbally abusive call help close friend left say lying call ruin life even know lying ignore really know anymore everyday confused right proud anything go really tough high school often time practice violin lot competition honor orch etc yeah good yanno college application coming think anything show homework class finally relax lunch tell mom homework lunch avoid getting kicked compulsively check phone read text phone reason parent bought go stuff take tell nothing sort yet crazy horrible reputation ruining liar guess even know tired know thing look forward live feel nothing suicidal thought depression whatever mom saying lying making know even though teenager could probably say boyfriend person want spend life thing work dated ha giving everyone aneurysm something dealing getting mad violin sport basically nothing time energy generation pretty damn good stuff thing keeping alive fact know boyfriend probably would really hard time dealing fact wa gone long time debating ending relationship make easier sorry know ask please help talked know anymore everytime someone try help everything honestly get worse energy eat function tbh please help
Can’t stop my mind,I think every night I wish I wouldn’t wake up. I thought the divorce would help the feelings. I thought therapy would help. I thought pills would help. But everyday is sad and all consuming. I can’t think about anything other than my situation or killing myself often at the same time. I’m so tired of the next day coming. Finding myself praying to find the courage to do it vs the courage to not do it. Today isn’t the day for me but it feels inevitable.,throwRAisitover,0,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/fdlgtn/cant_stop_my_mind/,think every night wish wake thought divorce would help feeling thought therapy would help thought pill would help everyday sad consuming think anything situation killing often time tired next day coming finding praying find courage v courage today day feel inevitable,stop mind,throw ra,455,18,throw ra think every night wish wake thought divorce would help feeling thought therapy would help thought pill would help everyday sad consuming think anything situation killing often time tired next day coming finding praying find courage v courage today day feel inevitable stop mind

My story,"Last year I was a freshman in highshighschool. Near the end I was ready. I was gonna do it then one of the people told my mom and got me help. I told 3 people john, alex, and gabriel. Kohn said he would help me but lied. Alex did nothing and gabriel helped me. A few nights ago john texted me. This is our conversation.



John: I know you hate and despise me with a passion, But I must ask, Why? I just kinda needed some clearence. I'm not here to pick a fight with you, but to come to an understanding, So looks like u have spent 10 mins typing, I guess I can expect a bomb drop on me or som.

Me: I was on the verge of suicide and u said u would do something u promised and I hoped deep down someone would I was going to kill my fucking self on the 13 of july that year stab in the heart with a fuckin knife u promised me someone who I dispite all other judgement thought was a good if not the closest friend I had u did nothing u would've let me die it was gabriel the one who I thought wouldn't give a shit because of all the shit we went through it was him who got me the fucking help I hate u so fuck much so so much with all my fucking heart every muscle and bone and tendon and bit of flesh burns with hatred when i even think about u and the worst part is i cant unthink it I cant just forget an entire year cause I fuckin would forget u exist forget the entirety of 8th grade then some more u go around saying oh jay was just faking it he wanted the attention I was going to fuckin die and u were gonna sit there and watch with ur thumb up ur ass like some sorta fuckin beast of the fields then u come back to me and ask what I did wrong why do u hate me like that's a question then ur not even gonna say sorry u weren't just a shitty friend ur a shitty person and I made it my mission now to stop people from making the same mistake I did trusting u fuck I was a goddamn idiot but it doesn't even matter now I know where everyone stands when I asked them to pick a side a while back and they said they were with me only to lie and be with u I know now I only hate 3 things u Hitler and satan and u u didnt even do just that u hit ur brother u shot at me with a bb gun u hit my head with a bat and each time I tried to be a friend have someone by myside thought it would be u guess not then theres ur sarcasm again and I could keep going but ur rushing me so here


John: Well holy shit That was... Okay look man I'm honestly speechless But I need you to understand my perception I thought that you were just up to ur usual antics and I thought u were begging for attention, and I decided to not give you that attention. You aren't gonna believe me but I am honestly truly sorry if you felt and continue to feel this way I mean I never wanted any of this, I was led to believe that you had gone mad and I had to leave it at there Suicide is stupid by the way, I have considered that for myself in the past and I'm telling you it does not go well because those who have acted on that literally destroy their loved ones. You need to understand that I never wanted to hurt you in the way that you felt I just thought it was a bucket of bullshit, but I know realize you needed help Look I wanna clear the air here, I know you'll never consider me friend and that you hate my guts, but I want to make my peace with you and I want you to understand that I never hated you, and I am a man who believes in redemption There's nothing I can do, you clearly are a broken individual, I pray for your healing and I hope god watches you I hope that you seek help and that you talk to someone about this

Me: Horse shit

John: Ik that's what you think

Me: Need I continue Or do u wanna talk in person

John: Look man all I can say is god bless your soul, may his angels watch you, may you be free of this cursed darkness, and if you wanna talk in person I'm totally up for that

Me: Tomorrow freshman bathrooms by the commons around a lunch

John: I have a class I need to attend for and my schedule is kinda tight, but I could tomorrow morning at the main commons or som I believe you and I have a shared friend, Jake Maybe he could be present as we hash things out 

Me: No This is a u and me thing Fuck class

John: Of course, but listen if you wanna reach me, I'm around in the mornings or C lunch period

Me: Fuck that then

John: I kinda got fucked with the tardies rn so... I mean I'm open to discussing with you 

Me: Fuck ok 

John: I just need a time that works for both of us

Me: I'm just gonna say it all here

John: I can get on call if you like?

Me: Cant

John: Aight Then ig you just tell me here

Me: Shortened version 

Beginning of 9th grade I was completely alone u guys who were supposed to be my fuckin friends ran from me knew no one talked to no one only friend I had was jd and hes an ass on his own lowering my self esteem and all this went on for a month finally when I caught hold of u I invited u all to my birthday where everyone fucked off on their own leaving me once again alone to top that off all 3 of u alex gabriel and u tried to leave then homecoming where my past finally caught up to me I met someone we went on a date and it was ok I got to the house only to find some cunt who left the group who u took the place of and he told them everything about me how I hurt people without remorse and how I would so it again and how I was dangerous and shit they knew and I went with them they tried confronting me about it but I lied I hate liars and I lied to make that worse she was with someone else and I couldn't do shit about it when I go over to look for u bing notification everyone except me with the caption only friends I need or something I didnt have a ride home so I went back each question getting more and more personal until my dad came where I had to lie to him too and mom I knew I was alone then thought for a while then the idea slipped in for all but a second talked myself out ended the semester kicked out of 4 groups and our relationship starting to tear

Second half dad beat me mom beat me I wasnt doing well anywhere I went I was getting called a school shooter mick was getting away with everything and I was constantly at the bottom always mom thinks I'm gay humiliates me to the point of breaking down telling her I'm not only to find out later she didnt believe me start to lose friends over time get kicked out of sam billings table and im alone idea slips in I think on it for a bit longer before talking myself out again dad moves to Arizona leaving mom stressed jd convinces me I'm not a good person I give him a peice of my mind we dont talk for a bit I get in a fight lose and get made fun of for it the idea is set now stuck in my head I'm going to do this i need to mom humiliates me further but apologizes I know it's fake I say to myself I should probably tell the fuckers so they aren't blindsided gabriel snitches later that night and I have a difficult conversation with mom concerning my mental health I go to therapy over the summer

This year I come to school knowing jake over summer hoping I have at least lunch but no I no nobody I'm alone again I see Sam's tables broken up over schedules I say not again and assemble what I can every other persons telling me I'm gay kill myself or something I know I need to keep loving myself even if I'm alone then I get word that u were telling people I  was saying I was going to kill myself for attention then the switch flipped I hate u always will I will never forgive u gabriel or alex never I bullshat my way into Jake's friend Austin's life stayed there expanded my group 

Now after thinking to myself why I'm even trying I realize u dont care ur a self centered asshole I had my fair share of toxicity but u took the cake and it was my fault for inviting u to the table now I see some freshman showing the same mannerisms as u and I know I need to stop it because u were a good friend but then u stopped and I dont understand that I don't get it why it doesn't matter the only one u care about is u and u will do anything to make sure u are ok or u come out on top like u have been but it doesn't matter I have the first real friend I had in a while a trustworthy group of friends and a gf lifes uphill only problem is u and I'm stuck on that cant shake it u aren't a good person idk if its u lashing out because of the divorce or u just think ur better than others or what anyways every part of my body wants u to burn in hell 
If that's too much to read listen to creep humility and magic city

John: I finished it all It was alot but I read it I don't what to say So you think I'm some narcisstic prick So much self pity man, and I have to say this really isnt healthy 

Me: Typical I said what I had to

John: You may not be able to forgive me, but you need to understand that this is not how any human being should live I wouldnt wish how you feel on my worst enemy

Me: I look for the good in everything I cant find any in u I said what i had to

John: I know Again you may think I'm some prideful narcisstic son on a bitch, but I do care about people, especially for those who are broken

Me: U are Look in a mirror and think long and hard about urself

John: I mean thats only how you view me There are millions of ways different people who see you You think I'm a bad man, and I accept your thoughts, I mean thats not who I am, but if thats the picture you painted then I'm sorry

Me: I'm an asshole that's how 80% of people see me and I'm ok with that But ask any one

John: My advice to you is find a light, be free, never let the pain, the darkness determine who you are

Me: Tell them answer honestly Dont therapize me

John: I'm happy that you met Jake, he is a truly great friend and is very supportive, I'm glad that you have someone like him in your life

Me: Fuck off with ur therapeutic bullshit

John: I'm not being your therapist, but the more you hang on to this hate and anger, than life will just be a major bummer I mean ur stubborn man

Me: Thing is I want to forgive and forget But I cant

John: And you can Thats ur choice

Me: U may be sorry now

John: U can let go of it all

Me: But that doesn't fix what ubdid U did*

John: What I did? Its all in ur head

Me:  I will never forgive u

John: You painted this fucked up picture of me

Me: Or alex Or gabriel I will not because theres no good in u We all see ourselves as saints and our enemies as devils

John: I'm not your enemy

Me: To me ur just the shittyiest of shitty people U are John U are

John: Than thats a u problem

Me: U were about to let me die After u promised to be with me Then u lie

John: First of all suicide is an option and I never advised you to do that

Me: I told u And gabriel And alex Only u 3

John: What was I supposed to do?  Did you want me to call a hotline or som?

Me: U were supposed to be my friend Just be my friend But u didnt and u cant and u won't

John: I wanted to be your friend, and I'm sorry that I decided to not even say anything That I took ur claims as an attention stunt

Me: U say sorry now because I explained U arent Dont kid urself 

John: Your in a dark dark place, and I feel very sorry for you, your broken and fucked up and all I can do is wish you the best Jay

Me: Were I'm not anymore I was in a dark place Things are fucked up Yes but that's gonna help later Gammbette jay gammbette and be kensuki Words I tell myself every morning Gammbette do your best in try in Japanese Kensuki the art of using gold to repair broken things Ik I'm broken but I'm fixing myself Something I would recommend u do

John: I'm happy for you

Me: No u fuckin aren't

John: Think what you want

Me: I can almost smell the bullshit Its alarming

John: Well again thats a u issue Nothing I can do about that

Me: I can't do shit about that Change my view I'm just gonna let u know rn I mean every word I say

John: So ig we are not on good terms? And cannot change it

Me: I hate u and cant forgive u I'm sorry But what you did to me I cant forgive

John: Take care of yourself Jay, I hope you find your inner peace, I hope you can achieve your nirvana Goodbye

This is why I want to kill myself... Considering doing it tonight,"I'm nearly 23 years old. My father abandoned our family when I was 14. He was my best friend at the time... I haven't seen him in 6 years. This void made me become extremely close to my few friends. My clinginess reached a point where they got fed up from me and my anxiety and paranoia, that I've now lost my closest friends. I used to reach out to them for help, but it reached a point where everything was on their shoulders and they couldn't handle it anymore, so they distanced themselves with time.  
I used to be more fit and more attractive, but my life has taken a downwards spiral. I've gained about 70 lbs and my self-consciousness eats me up on the inside. My anxiety is through the roof and I have no motivation to do anything anymore. I'm on anxiety meds but truly think I should be on anti-depressants. I am now failing out of school and I don't have the heart to tell my mother. It will break her, but also I know that once she finds out, my life will probably turn into more of a hell, as she's always had extremely high standards for me. 

I'm still a virgin. I've never had a girlfriend. I was seeing this girl when I was 17, but that was about it. And that was at my peak attractiveness. It is now laughable how unattractive I am. People will literally laugh at me because of my appearance. My self-confidence is inexistent. I get anxiety attacks when people just look at me because I think that they are judging me on how I look. I can't deal with this anymore.

I moved away from my hometown 3 years ago for university. I haven't made a single new friend. I live alone. I literally don't use my voice anymore because I have no one to talk to. It reaches the point where I talk to myself because I'm scared that if I go without talking for so long that I will lose my voice. The only time I used to use my voice was while playing video-games online, it was the only thing that brought me a bit of joy. But my console broke, and I can't afford to fix it.

I have no ambitions. I don't know what I want to do in life. Everyone around me seems to have it figured out. Meanwhile, I'm a loser that is eating his life away. The only future I envision having is honestly the one where I throw myself off of my apartment building. I think about just ending it all the time. 

I feel alone in this world, and I don't have the motivation nor the self-confidence to do anything about it. The only people that may care about me are the couple family members I have, but I have put them under so much shit for all of the stuff I've done in the past that they are fed up with me. I want to kill myself, I just want to fall asleep and never wake up.",LukerTheDuker,2,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/fdo69f/this_is_why_i_want_to_kill_myself_considering/,nearly 23 year old father abandoned family wa 14 wa best friend time seen 6 year void made become extremely close friend clinginess reached point got fed anxiety paranoia lost closest friend used reach help reached point everything wa shoulder handle anymore distanced time used fit attractive life ha taken downwards spiral gained 70 lb self consciousness eats inside anxiety roof motivation anything anymore anxiety med truly think anti depressant failing school heart tell mother break also know find life probably turn hell always extremely high standard still virgin never girlfriend wa seeing girl wa 17 wa wa peak attractiveness laughable unattractive people literally laugh appearance self confidence inexistent get anxiety attack people look think judging look deal anymore moved away hometown 3 year ago university made single new friend live alone literally use voice anymore one talk reach point talk scared go without talking long lose voice time used use voice wa playing video game online wa thing brought bit joy console broke afford fix ambition know want life everyone around seems figured meanwhile loser eating life away future envision honestly one throw apartment building think ending time feel alone world motivation self confidence anything people may care couple family member put much shit stuff done past fed want kill want fall asleep never wake,want kill considering tonight,luke r duke r,2655,65,luke r duke r nearly 23 year old father abandoned family wa 14 wa best friend time seen 6 year void made become extremely close friend clinginess reached point got fed anxiety paranoia lost closest friend used reach help reached point everything wa shoulder handle anymore distanced time used fit attractive life ha taken downwards spiral gained 70 lb self consciousness eats inside anxiety roof motivation anything anymore anxiety med truly think anti depressant failing school heart tell mother break also know find life probably turn hell always extremely high standard still virgin never girlfriend wa seeing girl wa 17 wa wa peak attractiveness laughable unattractive people literally laugh appearance self confidence inexistent get anxiety attack people look think judging look deal anymore moved away hometown 3 year ago university made single new friend live alone literally use voice anymore one talk reach point talk scared go without talking long lose voice time used use voice wa playing video game online wa thing brought bit joy console broke afford fix ambition know want life everyone around seems figured meanwhile loser eating life away future envision honestly one throw apartment building think ending time feel alone world motivation self confidence anything people may care couple family member put much shit stuff done past fed want kill want fall asleep never wake want kill considering tonight

The man I want to marry is breaking my heart and I just can't do this.,"We have been together for almost four years and I had never been happier in my life than I have been since I met him.  He has helped and encouraged me to improve and grow so much.  He has never insulted me, never yelled at me, and while we've had disagreements we've never *fought*.  There has always been so much love here.

I want to spend the rest of my life with him.  I thought he wanted the same.  He says that he does.

However, he also says that he can't be satisfied sexually with just me.  He wants an open relationship so he can fool around with cis men.  I'm transgender, and it's killing me that he wants the one body part that I don't have more than he wants to be happy with me.

He doesn't believe our relationship is sustainable, and he can't promise he won't one day be tempted to cheat, if he doesn't ""have this outlet.""  He won't marry me unless I can agree to the open relationship.  I'm a deeply monogamous person and just can't do it.  I can't.

I never believed that anyone could love me; I have multiple sclerosis and am trans, along with a ton of other issues.  He has made me so happy, and I felt so loved and secure, just to learn that he isn't satisfied with me and never will be.  As I always feared, I'm just not good enough.

We're in couples counseling, he wants to make things work somehow, but I can't see any possible solution even though I want nothing more than him.  I hate my body more than ever before.  I hate myself.

I've struggled with depression and suicidal thoughts for the past 20 years.  I believe this was my last chance, and it is failing horribly, and I just don't have it in me to keep trying.",howthisstoryends,3,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/fdm2nr/the_man_i_want_to_marry_is_breaking_my_heart_and/,together almost four year never happier life since met ha helped encouraged improve grow much ha never insulted never yelled disagreement never fought ha always much love want spend rest life thought wanted say doe however also say satisfied sexually want open relationship fool around ci men transgender killing want one body part want happy believe relationship sustainable promise one day tempted cheat outlet marry unless agree open relationship deeply monogamous person never believed anyone could love multiple sclerosis trans along ton issue ha made happy felt loved secure learn satisfied never always feared good enough couple counseling want make thing work somehow see possible solution even though want nothing hate body ever hate struggled depression suicidal thought past 20 year believe wa last chance failing horribly keep trying,man want marry breaking heart,story end,1647,70,story end together almost four year never happier life since met ha helped encouraged improve grow much ha never insulted never yelled disagreement never fought ha always much love want spend rest life thought wanted say doe however also say satisfied sexually want open relationship fool around ci men transgender killing want one body part want happy believe relationship sustainable promise one day tempted cheat outlet marry unless agree open relationship deeply monogamous person never believed anyone could love multiple sclerosis trans along ton issue ha made happy felt loved secure learn satisfied never always feared good enough couple counseling want make thing work somehow see possible solution even though want nothing hate body ever hate struggled depression suicidal thought past 20 year believe wa last chance failing horribly keep trying man want marry breaking heart
How can I help?,"I’ve been *somewhat* suicidal myself. More so in the “Im in so much pain I want to stop existing” than having a plan to end it all kind of way. 

I love someone dearly who has attempted suicide more than once and been hospitalized after their attempts. They also struggle with addiction.

I’ve also lost someone I love to suicide. 

They’ve called me, more than once, often drunk or high, sometimes not, telling me goodbye, this was the end, and this was their plan (I don’t know if specific phrases are allowed, so to generalize, the gist is I have all I need to kill myself readily accessible/I am in the location where I’m going to kill my self and when we hang up I’m going to do it) 

Sometimes, I’m close enough that I can physically go to be with them. Sometimes I’m not. 

Every time, I feel like their life is in my hands. That’s not a responsibility I feel like I can handle. If something were to happen to them, I’d feel entirely responsible. 

I feel like I’ve read so much that suggestions to seek professional help aren’t helpful and the last thing to do is call the police or emergency services... but I am so scared. I love my friend and I want them to know it. I want them to know how truly I support them and don’t blame them for what they’re feeling or think they’re doing anything wrong. Because I truly don’t.

But I can’t handle feeling like their life is in my hands. I can’t handle feeling like if I say the wrong thing or don’t say the RIGHT thing and they die, it’s on me because I’m the one they chose to come to for help. I feel like I can’t be the help in these situations, but I don’t want to turn them away when they clearly need someone. 

It would be different if it wasn’t an active plan. I’m comfortable with I want to die sentiments. I’m comfortable with listening to someone talk about their deep pain and hatred towards themselves or ambivalence towards life. But the goodbye. The plan. The “I’m dead after we hang up” .... I don’t know what I’m supposed to do. I feel like I HAVE to take that seriously, because if I don’t, and they die... I have no words for what would come next.

Anyway. Any advice about any of this is appreciated.",howdoigethisright,0,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/fdnt8n/how_can_i_help/,somewhat suicidal im much pain want stop existing plan end kind way love someone dearly ha attempted suicide hospitalized attempt also struggle addiction also lost someone love suicide called often drunk high sometimes telling goodbye wa end wa plan know specific phrase allowed generalize gist need kill readily accessible location going kill self hang going sometimes close enough physically go sometimes every time feel like life hand responsibility feel like handle something happen feel entirely responsible feel like read much suggestion seek professional help helpful last thing call police emergency service scared love friend want know want know truly support blame feeling think anything wrong truly handle feeling like life hand handle feeling like say wrong thing say right thing die one chose come help feel like help situation want turn away clearly need someone would different active plan comfortable want die sentiment comfortable listening someone talk deep pain hatred towards ambivalence towards life goodbye plan dead hang know supposed feel like take seriously die word would come next anyway advice appreciated,help,doi get right,2174,15,doi get right somewhat suicidal im much pain want stop existing plan end kind way love someone dearly ha attempted suicide hospitalized attempt also struggle addiction also lost someone love suicide called often drunk high sometimes telling goodbye wa end wa plan know specific phrase allowed generalize gist need kill readily accessible location going kill self hang going sometimes close enough physically go sometimes every time feel like life hand responsibility feel like handle something happen feel entirely responsible feel like read much suggestion seek professional help helpful last thing call police emergency service scared love friend want know want know truly support blame feeling think anything wrong truly handle feeling like life hand handle feeling like say wrong thing say right thing die one chose come help feel like help situation want turn away clearly need someone would different active plan comfortable want die sentiment comfortable listening someone talk deep pain hatred towards ambivalence towards life goodbye plan dead hang know supposed feel like take seriously die word would come next anyway advice appreciated help

My story (incomplete),"Similar story here, OP. In my case my dad spent my childhood promising to *help* me pursue a science career if I moved in with him, along with many other exorbitant promises. He then coaxed me into signing my life savings over to him under the guise of him teaching me money management skills. Afterwards his personality instantly changed like he had been replaced with a body snatcher:

He started holding my money hostage to control me. He forced me into a flat earth fundamentalist church. He started incessantly discouraging my scientific interests. I was forbidden from me from even being seen with a girl since it might lead others to think we were sexually active. He threatened to cut me off if I ever associated with members of so many demographics that I was functionally unable to have friends. He would scream at me and belittle and humiliate me for hours every day. His church was so strict that I had to give up most of my hobbies for being ""sinful"". He tried to damage my relationships with all of my other family members. He would constantly follow me around and would incessantly act out for attention so much that I struggled to even attempt my schoolwork or even my remaining hobbies. I was quickly so psychologically broken that I started failing my classes despite growing up an honors student. 

A few years later, I took on a second major hoping to raise my GPA and just barely squeak into grad school. Dad took this to somehow mean that I was ""on the verge of graduating with two PhDs"". He completely flipped from incessantly discouraging me to exerting 24/7 pressure to graduate with those two PhDs *immediately*. I explained over and over that I wasn't getting two PhDs, but he wouldn't accept it. Despite my protests he spread word far and wide about my ""two PhDs"" and I gained a reputation as some kind of miracle prodigy that I could never actually live up to. By this point Dad was in the final stages of terminal heart problems and was so relentless in his pressure that I started going along with it because even after all his years of lies and abuse I didn't want to disappoint him on his death bed.

Years went by and things continued to get worse for me. I was overwhelmed with preemptive grief over dad's impending death every day. I went through a traumatic religious deconversion and lost my soul-sustaining (nonfundamentalist) faith in God. I started experiencing severe diabetes symptoms. I was struggling with the increased course load and failing to recover my grades as Dad continued to sink deeper and deeper into an obsession with those completely imaginary PhDs. One day dad started taking me to visit some old man from his crazy cult who was bedridden from his own terminal heart problems. 

More years went by and both dad and the old guy were both alive. That meant that Dad had been in the final stages of terminal illness for something like 6 years. I realized that he had been outrageously exaggerating his health problems and that I had spent the last several of them going along with his delusional nonsense

Stress and loneliness are dragging me down again,"After 29 years of being a shut in, sometimes having social anxiety so bad that I couldn't step out my house or go near the windows, mental health so bad that i couldn't work or finish school, I decided to go back to school. I'm dependent on a longtime SO and it makes me feel awful. There have been elements of abuse in the past and I dont think I can fully trust anyone, so I have to do this or die or get a high paying job without a degree or hurting my back(I have a terrible back and neurological problems) I'll be left with something like stripping, or just suicide.

&amp;nbsp;

At this point, classes are getting more intense, I'm already behind in an online class that posted no deadlines, because I'm prioritizing a class in which I work around 30 hours/week to keep my quality high(I'm aiming for A's and this class is supposedly graded harshly-so far I have A's and 1 B on something I worked on for just 10 hours). Anyway, so I am behind in my online classes now, trying to make time to catch up, but seems impossible.  

&amp;nbsp;

My other in person class doesn't take as much time, I have a 4 hour studio and homework takes me maybe 1-5 hours usually. I have trouble managing time because I hardly see my SO, so when we do see each other, we stay up late and just play games. We havent had any intimacy in about a month, and otherwise it's like a 1-2x/month thing. He doesn't help me with the chores unless I ask a bunch of times even though i made a chore chart for us both to look at,on the fridge, and gave myself more things. He keeps promising he'll do chores,shower,brush his teeth, just basic things, and he doesn't. He actually said he'd do all the chores when I went back to school(like I'd done for him) and not to worry. I worried, but I left things for a bit and realized I was correct in being concerned after the house started looking trashed. If I talk to him he changes the topic or recites some meme. He kisses me maybe twice a day and is otherwise glued to his phone watching YouTube videos- he quit video games as they were time consuming but just switched to videos instead. He's so addicted to his phone that he got his by a bus last year, while I was passenger. He's usually on his phone while driving and there's nothing I can do. I dont drive because of my anxiety, and I dont have a working car. I am very stressed right now and feel totally alone. 
&amp;nbsp;

I literally dont have time to see a therapist. I dont even have time to see my doctors for checkups. All I do is work, at school,homework,and at home. I am painfully shy and awkward and have no friends. I've joined a few clubs to make friends but it seems impossible; people try to befriend me it seems, and I just don't know how to interact.  I had an amazing conversation with another top performer in my class with the difficult work and anticipated becoming friends- she tries, but I dont know how to reciprocate and I can tell that I make things uncomfortable because I react as if we never started forming a friendship, if that makes sense. 

&amp;nbsp;

In my other class there is one kid who has tried to befriend me. He has autism and comes across pretty brash. I try to remind myself that he has a condition and to not take things personally, but sometimes I can't help it and I feel terrible and other times he is just too close and I feel awkward. I think he seems genuinely friendly and most of the time I dont mind him, but I guess I'm just under so much stress at this point that everything is getting to me. The whole class is also pretty distracting, which again, is usually bearable but the stress is wearing me out and there's 0 things I can do to relieve it.

&amp;nbsp;

Yesterday I got a grade back from a quiz and just a friendly note to try to speak up more during critique(I'm a design student, so this is an art class). I made a mental note to make sure to speak up during critique last night, and then I panicked. First I panicked because I wanted to be done my painting beforehand- I hadn't planned properly and am always the slow one in everything, so I kept messing up and didn't finish in time. It seemed I was one of 2 others who hadn't finished so that made me feel a little better. Critique came and the aforementioned kid stood next to me as he always does, uncomfortably close, and then in front of me and I couldn't see the paintings. Panic increased and I didn't want to be rude so I didn't say anything. I planned for what shouldve been my painting for critique and was called out of order and further panicked. 
&amp;nbsp;

I have a disorder that causes dissociation under stress and I have social anxiety. So when I panic, my mind goes blank. This happened a few days ago; my dog is unfortunately aggressive with 1 dog in my neighborhood. She is a strong dog and fortunately until this point, it had only been my bf who had experienced this. She lunged at the dog and I wasnt strong enough to pull her back, I panicked,mind went blank, and I just stood there. In my mind, the only thing i could think was like, the idea or feeling of alarm, but I couldn't speak or move. The neighbor didn't seem to mind and gave the dogs treats, but I felt so terrible. I don't know how to fix this.

&amp;nbsp;

During the critique, my mind was blank and I didn't know what to say. I absorbed things others had said, but my mind flushed them out when I tried to speak. Speaking and thinking at the same time is difficult for me. I guess I'm just stupid. I usually think for a long time before I speak, and I can think and write, but I dont know how to think+speak quickly or at once. I just felt like crying and couldn't wait to just pack up and start on my drawing assignment(until I realized I'd forgotten my most important supplies).

&amp;nbsp;

I grew up with abusive parents. My dad was pretty absent, working a lot, but when he was home he was a complete ass. He would constantly provoke me. My older brother harshly picked on me. My mom did the most damage, somehow. I grew up thinking she was ""good cop"", she taught me to think that. She could do no wrong, she was perfect, she was always right. If she was upset with me, even if seemingly unreasonable, I did mental gymnastics with myself to justify it. Example: I didn't intervene in her argument with my dad over finances which 6 year old me didn't understand? I'm a bad person who doesn't love mom. 
Moms in the bathroom the 8th time this week with razor blades? I'd be her psychiatrist and beg her to come out,reason with her why she should. Eventually I realized I didn't have to say anything. Eventually still, I realized that I could probably leave because she would just come out soon anyway. I did once, around 6 or 7 and I guess she talked and I didn't respond, so she came literally running after me, cornered me, and yelled down at me for not loving her.
&amp;nbsp;
I have an eating disorder? 
I'm ""evil"", I'm a ""dirty slut"" even though I'm not allowed out of the house- this must be because of how I look or something I've done- am I that person? Mom says so, so i guess so. 
&amp;nbsp;
As a young child, I was mostly raised by my grandparents nextdoor and would sleep over at their house often. I'd cry myself to sleep every night because I thought my mom was mad at me. Every day, I'd be to blame for something. Once, I even got blamed for my dad losing $100. I don't even know why. My mom yelled from up at our back door to down at the yard at me, with the neighborhood kids all outside, telling me I'd better bring the $100 back right now. So then my friends assumed I was a thief(cause a 9 y/o who can't drive and never goes anywhere has a reason for money is definitely wont get caught with random money at some point 🙄). 

&amp;nbsp;

At some point, around 9, I started self harming because I didn't understand what I had apparently done. I was upset for always being such an apparent major cause of my mother's pain- the person I did love most in the world no matter what she thought.

&amp;nbsp;

My parents destroyed my education as an ongoing argument for the funsies I guess. I planned to graduate at 15 or 16 and GTFO. I was physically bullied at school to the point of having my arms near broken every day. I begged to be homeschooled- my plan was to be able to focus on my schooling without bullies and graduate early to get away from my family. I was in 2nd grade my first year homeschooling and skipped up to grade 5 work in everything but math, which I got up to maybe grade 3 which was equivalent to my current grade in public school work. My parents would argue about public and homeschooling and switch me back and forth at least once a school semester. So I'd be in public school in august for a few months, then homeschooled. Obviously this ruined my extra work I'd done and I became discouraged. In 7th grade, I began having a lot of trouble with math. My mom refused to help me, saying I had learning disability and just couldn't learn so to not do it(and then help my lovely, psychotic step sister instead). She'd do this to me at public school too, and I'd often go in humiliated having to explain that I couldn't finish my homework. 

&amp;nbsp;

At one point, I wasn't allowed outside(my grandparents had moved in) and due to that and all the stress, I embraced being reclusive. I told myself I wanted to be that way and whenever people would think it was odd, my mom would huff back at them before I could speak, saying that not everyone has to have friends.

&amp;nbsp;

And now I'm this. Looking back, I remember my dad telling me that my mom coddled me too much and kept me from other people, wanting me all to herself. At the time I thought it was ridiculous, but now I see he was right; she needed me to soothe her, to blame for everything, to be there in misery with her. 
&amp;nbsp;

I got older, decided that I wanted to try being social, so I'd say yes to every single opportunity. Every one. That was a terrible idea and I ended up being abused by a few predatory opportunists, which in turn caused me major anxiety, more than ever before, and I became more reclusive than ever before. I havent held a stable job in a while. Havent had friends since that time, about 10 years ago. I've been with my SO, who has been abusive off and on. Things were great for a few years until we moved out a few years ago, and now they've been very off and on. For a few years again, things have been pretty good as far as that goes, but obviously not having time and not feeling effort from the other person feels shitty too. 

&amp;nbsp;

A couple years ago I found myself in a terrible situation with him and decided my options were prostitution, stripping, drugs, or suicide. I mass applied to jobs but when I'd receive a response, I was never qualified for anything but retail which I've had bad experiences with and it doesn't pay enough. I stopped eating, became an alcoholic with the little funds I had, and attempted suicide somewhere near 3 times a week on average for a few months straight. I almost succeeded once and then my bf unexpectedly came home early and I was sent to the hospital. Things didn't get better when I got out, I threw away my antidepressants since my feelings felt inappropriate in relation to my thoughts and situation, and resumed weekly attempts. Otherwise I'd just lie in bed and try not to get up for fear of killing myself.

&amp;nbsp;

2017 and 2018 sucked. Last year got a little better and by the end of the year I decided to go back to school. I decided rather abruptly and didn't have time to seek diagnosis for learning disabilities, which I think I obviously have. I have a diagnosis of anxiety disorders and recurrent major depressive disorder but I've assumed I wouldn't receive any accommodations for those because.. what can be done?

&amp;nbsp;

Instead I've tried plowing through my feelings and intentionally making myself uncomfortable by joining clubs and going to campus in person, but I'm not adjusting as quickly as I'd hoped. And in the real world, I will have to talk, I will have to have social skills. No one cares about you in the real world. I'm old and have already exposed myself to that in the many job fields I've attempted, so I'm aware. 

&amp;nbsp;

I just feel like I'm a failure. And now I'm overloading myself and I dont want to back down, but idk how to deal with everything and get no help, and have nothing outside of school and working at home. I need a good balance, but I have literally no way of making that happen. I'm in a club that meets once a week, the paper which is 1x a month, and now a new club that no one showed up for, so I became club leader. This will force me into social situations, and I hope that I can do it. In my head I'm telling myself to just do it, so I try, and I talk, and garbage comes out. And I'm older than everyone else, so it's awkward. I'm not supposed to be so immature and stupid by social standards. 

&amp;nbsp;

I feel like I'm just not going to make it. I have straight A's but I feel like I don't deserve them. My art never looks good to me even after spending hours working. I need to make this work but I dont know how. I dont know how to change who I've been for 29 years, in an instant, but I desperately want to. I want to be different, I dont want to be who I am anymore. In the meantime, I'm trying to squeeze in time with my SO and getting very little sleep. Most of it is just time in the same room not even interacting or talking or anything and I feel really void of any affection and social interaction right now, as well as anything fun. I used to walk every day- it's something that lessens the frequency of nerve pain and I dont even have time for that. The weather has been shit anyway. I dont find gaming fun, I don't like to sit, but that's all I'm doing. I'm exhausted. 

&amp;nbsp;

I dont even know what I'm getting at anymore with this. I'm just frustrated with life. Everything is dull,I'm over stressed,lonely, and I honestly just hate myself. Everything about myself is awful, I really hate who I am. I became really sick in the first few weeks of school and have had bronchitis for about 3-4 weeks. It's getting better but I feel like that happening really fucked a lot up for me since I had no energy. I dont know how to manage everything or how to socialize. I feel like I should just kill myself but I dont know how to even do it properly in a way that wont be totally awful. I'm looking to get away from pain and if the last minutes of my life could at least be peaceful that would be, well, ideal.

My life is a fucking joke,"I have 0 friends. I’m getting bad marks in school and I’m garbage at my major. Never had a girlfriend and I have terrible anxiety that inhibits me from everything. I don’t have the balls to approach a girl or even ask a question in class. And the final blow is that I’m literally broke and have to work on the weekends to keep ~150 bucks in my account which just puts me further behind in school. 

I’m just so tired of everything. Tired of doing everything alone, having no one to talk. Tired of constant school work or shitty part-time job work. I resent my dad and dislike my step mom.

Fuck an interesting title,"So I've been scrolling down this page for a while now and I'm amazed by how much people feel the same way as I have for a while now. It doesn't make me feel any better but actually more determined to take my life knowing people live the rest of their life like this. 

I'm 16 years old I left school at 15 quit college at 16 and have no qualifications to rely on. I'm extremely socially awkward and possibly have deppresion I don't know. See the thing is I also have a extreme fear of doctors and just having people examine me in general and this has been taking more of an effect on me than normal.

Around December last year I took acid for the first time. I don't remember a lot about that night as I entered an incredibly deep bad trip after my friend was kicked out of the house leaving me alone  on my first time. As I said I can't remember a lot about that night but  2 main factors stuck with me 1. My balls felt HEAVY real heavy 2. I thought I killed myself on multiple occasions that night. I kept seeing images of a weapon infront of me each time different each time more deadly. Everyone time believing they were real I tried to use them to end my life. And it felt like I would wake up everytime alive and I would cry. 

Reading back on this probably should have mentioned before I was already suicidal as shit before taking oh well.

Anyway couple months progress I'm doing ok and I'm lying in bed smoking a joint when that sane feeling of heaviness occurred in my balls not as strong this time but still there. After a couple weeks of consistent around night time feelings of heaviness occurred I decided to Google (yeah ik) my issue.

To my absolute fucking horror I discovered I have something called a vardicole or something like that I don't want to go back and check as I'm extremely 0aranoid of reading something I don't want to.

Now before anything gets typed I want to say that it is 100 percent that condition (whatever the name may be) as the symptoms aren't exactly common among other conditions. 

As I said in extremely scared of hospitals and getting examined so something around that area has an extreme effect on me even thinking about getting it checked.

I've been doing good for a while now but I can't get the thoughts out of my head and I can feel myself spiralling until those final moments where I can find eternal peace. 

So this is what I ask of you reading this if you would help me. I'm terrified of searching what will happen to me if I don't get surgery but I also kind of want to know so I'm basing this heavily on trust if you were to do a tiny bit of research on the condition and only leave a positive comment ABSOLUTELY NOTHING NEGATIVE ABOUT CONDITION PLEASE. Like if it will damage me do not tell me even if it can kill please don't tell me. But if you find anything that will be reassuring please let me know. Because I'm not getting surgery so please please don't tell me anything bad about it I am genuinely terrified to post this in case people just say shit anyway 

Also to find condition type into Google wierd feeling in testicle or something like that I'm not sure I'm sorry I know it's is a lot but if you could take time out of your night to help me it would mean more than you know.",ayehullo,10,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/fdmrsf/fuck_an_interesting_title/,scrolling page amazed much people feel way make feel better actually determined take life knowing people live rest life like 16 year old left school 15 quit college 16 qualification rely extremely socially awkward possibly deppresion know see thing also extreme fear doctor people examine general ha taking effect normal around december last year took acid first time remember lot night entered incredibly deep bad trip friend wa kicked house leaving alone first time said remember lot night 2 main factor stuck 1 ball felt heavy real heavy 2 thought killed multiple occasion night kept seeing image weapon infront time different time deadly everyone time believing real tried use end life felt like would wake everytime alive would cry reading back probably mentioned wa already suicidal shit taking oh well anyway couple month progress ok lying bed smoking joint sane feeling heaviness occurred ball strong time still couple week consistent around night time feeling heaviness occurred decided google yeah ik issue absolute fucking horror discovered something called vardicole something like want go back check extremely 0aranoid reading something want anything get typed want say 100 percent condition whatever name may symptom exactly common among condition said extremely scared hospital getting examined something around area ha extreme effect even thinking getting checked good get thought head feel spiralling final moment find eternal peace ask reading would help terrified searching happen get surgery also kind want know basing heavily trust tiny bit research condition leave positive comment absolutely nothing negative condition please like damage tell even kill please tell find anything reassuring please let know getting surgery please please tell anything bad genuinely terrified post case people say shit anyway also find condition type google wierd feeling testicle something like sure sorry know lot could take time night help would mean know,fuck interesting title,aye hull,3247,25,aye hull scrolling page amazed much people feel way make feel better actually determined take life knowing people live rest life like 16 year old left school 15 quit college 16 qualification rely extremely socially awkward possibly deppresion know see thing also extreme fear doctor people examine general ha taking effect normal around december last year took acid first time remember lot night entered incredibly deep bad trip friend wa kicked house leaving alone first time said remember lot night 2 main factor stuck 1 ball felt heavy real heavy 2 thought killed multiple occasion night kept seeing image weapon infront time different time deadly everyone time believing real tried use end life felt like would wake everytime alive would cry reading back probably mentioned wa already suicidal shit taking oh well anyway couple month progress ok lying bed smoking joint sane feeling heaviness occurred ball strong time still couple week consistent around night time feeling heaviness occurred decided google yeah ik issue absolute fucking horror discovered something called vardicole something like want go back check extremely 0aranoid reading something want anything get typed want say 100 percent condition whatever name may symptom exactly common among condition said extremely scared hospital getting examined something around area ha extreme effect even thinking getting checked good get thought head feel spiralling final moment find eternal peace ask reading would help terrified searching happen get surgery also kind want know basing heavily trust tiny bit research condition leave positive comment absolutely nothing negative condition please like damage tell even kill please tell find anything reassuring please let know getting surgery please please tell anything bad genuinely terrified post case people say shit anyway also find condition type google wierd feeling testicle something like sure sorry know lot could take time night help would mean know fuck interesting title

"In the best way I could, I tried. But it didn't work","Last night was hard. Harder than the rest. I won't lie, all my feelings of death were enhanced when I saw that my e×, my first and only love, have the time of his life with someone else. I was drunk and sure I wanted to die. So I told a friend and she was sad, but I reassured her I wasnt going to do anything. When I went home to my apartment, I took a handful of ibuprofen pills and went to sleep. I probably should have taken more because I'm awake typing this. I know it's stupid to think I could overdose on ibuprofen, but I didn't have anything else. I'm so disappointed that I woke up this morning and saw a text from me ex, essentially saying that he has been over me for almost a year and that he was happy now and he was over it. Him telling me to get over it. The reason I want to die isn't because of him. However, knowing that whatever feelings I felt of love were unrequited, just makes me wish I wasn't alive to see it. I wish it was my last message. I wish it worked somehow. I'm just so tired of living my life, but there's no real way to end it. I'm trapped. Every attempt gets me closer to my goal, but I'm too afraid to do it.

Eternal Rest,"I’m a 13 year old boy, and I don’t want to be one of those self diagnosing people only looking for attention. Lately all I can think about killing myself or just saying fuck everything in life. Hate to say it but if I had a gun right now I think I would kill myself. It’s fast and easy, no pain unlike waiting for you to bleed out from your slit wrists. No one ever likes me. My parents always talk about what a useless piece of shit I am and brags to their friends about it like it’s an accomplishment. “You know that he didn’t even do this and this, etc. He’s such a fucking asshole he doesn’t do anything right. I wish I never had kids, I wanted a girl!”, they would say usually weekly. That shit hurts. I’ve been rejected by everyone. I’ve always had straight A’s, been the smartest and mostly progressive person in the class. I’m tired of putting on a facade that anything is worth anything. There is no heaven or hell, just nothing. So why not end it? No one’s listened to my problems. “Man up, boys don’t cry! Women run the world, all men are pigs and need to die”, is what I’m constantly told. I just don’t know anymore, I just stopped caring. All I do is listen to music and cry. School is useless, learning absolutely fucking nothing and wasting your life away for a degree you can’t use. I’m sure everyone is gonna say, I’m so young, I can’t have depression. Of course not, he’s just going through a phase and is seeking attention. But that’s alright. Always been introverted and quiet. So, I just don’t know. I think I should kill myself soon life has no purpose nor meaning, just an eternal land of misery and fake happiness. The only thing that makes me remotely happy is video games and talking to people on them, but playing games is a rare occurrence. Never allowed to play though I excel every way in school, so fuck it. Drop everything who gives a shit about grades. Who gives a shit about anything. So... I’m done here.

"He took my childhood, but I’m taking my life","I was scared he was going to do what he did to me to another little girl, and so I finally reported my abuse to the police nearly 6 years after it had ended. There was no physical evidence and so to press charges they need me to testify in court. 

I’m going to testify, but then I’m going to kill myself. Regardless of the verdict, I will have made my disgusting and horrible actions known to the public so history cannot repeat itself, and little girls will be safe from the predator who stole so much from me. It’s just so much easier to guarantee that my suffering will end than to expect a court to do right thing.

In all honestly, I never imagined living this long, I never thought I’d make it to my senior year of high school. I’m supposed to go to college in the fall, but I’ll be dead by then. I wish I could do it sooner but I don’t want to be the coward that let others get hurt when it was preventable.",cudaheyyy,3,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/fdp4n2/he_took_my_childhood_but_im_taking_my_life/,wa scared wa going another little girl finally reported abuse police nearly 6 year ended wa physical evidence press charge need testify court going testify going kill regardless verdict made disgusting horrible action known public history cannot repeat little girl safe predator stole much much easier guarantee suffering end expect court right thing honestly never imagined living long never thought make senior year high school supposed go college fall dead wish could sooner want coward let others get hurt wa preventable,took childhood taking life,cuda hey yy,915,44,cuda hey yy wa scared wa going another little girl finally reported abuse police nearly 6 year ended wa physical evidence press charge need testify court going testify going kill regardless verdict made disgusting horrible action known public history cannot repeat little girl safe predator stole much much easier guarantee suffering end expect court right thing honestly never imagined living long never thought make senior year high school supposed go college fall dead wish could sooner want coward let others get hurt wa preventable took childhood taking life

I haven’t made a post in about a year,"I’m 19 now, Im surprised I made it this far. But around Halloween I cut my wrist, with a big scare to show for it. I moved out my parents house, which I thought would make things better, but it really didn’t. I’m still suffering greatly. I feel I can’t even put it into words the emptiness and great suffocation I feel to be alive everyday. Im in community college but I barely go. I work a part time job but I only get one day a week. It’s all so overwhelming. I wanted to be an artist but I can’t even make art anymore, everything feels like such a burden and such a chore in my life. I feel like people don’t care about me at all. I understand they have their own lives, but I feel no one takes what I say seriously. Especially the people I live with, my sister and her wife. They say “we care about you and we understand what you’re feeling but it comes to a point where you have to do things.” Like I understand that, I’m trying, but I just can’t. I’m useless, horrible, and incompetent. 

As a kid, I never really felt happy either. I was always left alone, hated, and ignored. As a kid I was sexually abused for about 2 years by an older girl then 2 random occasions by 2 boys. I’ve suffered from my trauma that didn’t come to surface until I was 16. So I’ve just been dealing with that for a while and I can’t seem to overcome it. I’ve tried a couple medications but they don’t really seem to work. Killing myself seems to be only way to end my pain. I can’t function as a human. I just get so tired, mentally and physically.  I always hope for things to get better but they never do. Im just a fat sack of shit who won’t accomplish anything in their life. I feel I can’t say anything how I truly feel.

Pragmatic suicide,"This might sound ridiculous, but I want to die, and I'm not severely depressed. I'm approaching this purely philosophically.

The way I see it, my life is more suffering than joy, and that's probably not going to change. In fact, I would say this is true of most people. We spend most of our time doing things we don't want to do: working, cleaning, driving in traffic, feeling hungry, experiencing physical discomfort, etc, etc. Why would it not be better to not exist at all (I don't believe in an afterlife) rather than experience the totality of consciousness?

Now other people will mourn my death, this much is true. But they're going to mourn my death regardless of when it happens. No mourning is avoided by making it happen now. If anything, I'm at a point in my life when no one is dependent on me and my death will have the smallest impact it probably ever will.

I'm not sure were else to turn,"I have nothing but negative thoughts all the time, I can remember when it started but it has gotten so bad I tend to cry myself to sleep if I even can sleep. I don't know who to talk to and don't really have anyone to talk to so I just want to dump everything here and maybe get some guidance before I do something to make the pain go away. I never see my parents due to my mom and step dad being too busy with work and running a business and my dad is probably somewhere rotting in Arizona. My sister is deployed in the navy and the other ran away a few years ago and haven't heard from her, and my older brother is a drug addict that cut ties with us a long time ago. 

I don't want to message a suicide hotline out of fear they will send an ambulance or force me into a hospital forcing bills on me that I can not afford, and I have no one close to talk to about it. My situation is, growing up my parents both lived in different bad areas with little money. I was never smart or talented at anything besides having an over active imagination. I always had a learning issue both with paying attention and remembering information regardless of how hard I tried. Didn't have a lot of friends and ended up dropping out of high school. About 3 years ago I went back and got my Adult Diploma with the hopes it would be enough to get me on my feet. I'm now almost 26 and just a few months ago after I saw someone about my mental health I found out I have ADD. So some things where answered there, but it didn't help much. 

The small amount of friends that I have, have become aware of my increasing depressed emotions and have tried to help but for the most part, they seem to pay no mind to it. I've working dead end jobs for most of my adult life until recently when I took a boot camp course in the Information Technology field. I then interned for 5 weeks and after got a position working for a small company as an IT help desk technician under a 3 month to perm contract. Or that's what they told me during the interview. I never did anything IT related and the contract was constantly extend by 3 months until my 9th month there. In that time, I've worked for some bad companies, but I have never worked somewhere that treated there (specifically the US employees) so poorly. They then after promising to increase my pay hired me on full time as salary, and cut my pay thinking I wouldn't notice. I then secretly started looking for new positions starting last July until November of last year when I was tired of they way they have treated me for over a year and without thinking, just left, even though I have monthly bills. 

On top of the learning problems, I also have extreme anger problems and am very VERY impatient. As far as work goes, I have applied to countless IT positions since last July, with professional help updating resumes and cover letters, and re learning (trying to) as much IT knowledge as I can after using pretty much none of it at my last job and forgetting almost all of it, but I've gotten nothing. I have had 2 companies interview me and reject me after the 2nd or 3rd interview, and all of the other countless companies I've applied to have either flat out rejected me or have not said anything. I have next to nothing left with money and if I don't find something soon, I will lose everything and I can only imagine how bad my credit will be and the law suits to follow. Other than job things, I have never been in a real relationship, I never see my family even though I literally live with my mom and step dad, I almost never see my friends, I have an extreme hate for people I'm assuming due to everything I've had to go through over the years, and every day I spend hours trying to teach myself new things and applying for any position available that could possible help me with my situation, but since the last interview rejection and the constant no reply and email rejections, I can't anymore. 

I've tried so hard to make things better for myself, seeking medical help, close support from family and friends, and will power, but it's always one step forward and then being launched back. I'm tired of starting over, I'm tired of only knowing rejection and being ignored not just from jobs but from everything. I have become so angry and hate filled that I can't see happiness in anything. I used to love movies and video games and can't find joy in those. The only piece of escape I have day to day is music, because it almost thinks for me. I'm listening to it but I feel like it's also listening to me, feeling my constant pain and emotional wreck. Everyone says it will get better, but I've been at this for so long and it only keeps getting worse. I have put the effort in but it's like some deity is purposefully trying to prevent me from being happy or making myself successful, and over the past few weeks, I can't stop thinking of killing myself. Making this awful pain go away and not feeling anything anymore. The only thing that holds me back is the thought of what comes after. Possible non existence which I can't even comprehend. Just not knowing is the only thing holding me back, but even that fear is starting to go away and taking an early exit seems more and more like the best option.

I apologize for the extremely long post, maybe just a way to leave a small mark on existence to make myself feel a little better. I don't seem myself feeling any better even if my hard work eventually gets me anywhere, a family, a job that actually pays enough for me to live on my own, not constantly worrying if I have enough for food and water or if I have to cut that out to make my payments. It's hard to feel happy or accomplished when all you know is failure and loss. There is more but I feel like I've said enough if anyone even reads this. I've re read this and gone over it a few times and I just keep feeling worse and adding more to it.

Fuck you for being an effeminate little boy that made you such an easy target. You could have interesting in ANY FUCKING WAY yet you had to be just a fucking vanilla ass piece of shit in the corner for people to show and shoot shit at.

Fuck you for remembering the physical and emotional abuse your dad did to you and your family.

Fuck you for letting your mom run her little experiments on your body like some sort of lab rat.

Fuck you for speaking out about your suffering when you did. Going to the adults really improved your life and didn't just make your abusers hate you more while they got off with slaps on the wrist, huh?

Fuck you for remembering your childhood, especially only the bad parts. I'm 25 now and am just now experiencing these again, and you have no idea what sort of hell I'm in getting these vague memories again and again. This is YOUR FAULT!

I want you dead like how I want me dead. I want you to suffer way more than you ever had before just so you won't survive and I don't have to experience it anymore.

Personal count down to my suicide. My plan.,"I am a caucasian male , age 30. I wont get into complete vivid details of the numerous conditions i have ( childhood exc ) , this started happening when i was around 27. An ex and i whom spent well over 10 years together had broken up due to her unfaithfulness exc. Something happened and although i have spoken to many people and therapists. I feel like the real me is dead. And i am a walking multiple personality basket case , im always being someone im not , no freinds , all that which i had motivation for and excitement for is nothing. I am an empty shell. We got back together and she informed me that she was pregnant by a fling , which was planned , please note that we tried for kids for 6 years prior and she was found out to be infertile unless on fertility meds , long story short she aborted that child and got pregnant with me. Given that the situation prior was hard enough , the trauma and pure gut wrenching pain of questioning the pregnancy as well as my family questioning took its tole , work deterriorated and personal happyness was destroyed.

I dont know why , but i feel that its the logical thing to do. Given my situations. Im always being someone im not , multiple people. I make rash decisions that have and ruined my life. I have always wanted to be a police officer and thats thrown out due to tatoo policys , people have always avoided me because im either creepy or just weird. My family has abandonned me legit. I just work and sit in a basement. My suicide will commence in july 15th 2020. I plan to make it as suddle as possible , maybe an accident.

For them to ask hey hru unprovoked no one does that then everyone says when someone kills themselves 'hey I didn't know they were feeling like that' I wrote a note and I just want to do it but I can't but I want and I will. That's the only thing I'm motivated to do. Force myself to commit suicide. Literary nothing helps and I'm sick of trying and I understand others are in this situation but I can't really take this cause I'm too weak for it.

I come from a long line of dead people.,"I know everyone technically does.

I’m trans, gay, a person of color, mentally ill, and I feel like I’m living on borrowed time. My body and head keeps fighting against me as things get externally better, comparatively. I’ve been having blood problems - or maybe just extra health anxiety, I genuinely do not know. Healthcare for trans people is shit. I haven’t had an official doctor, just rotating nurse practitioners from clinics.

When I came out to my grandparents, my grandma said it ran on my mom’s side of the family. Her words were that there “was another [transgender], but he’s dead now”. I don’t know who that is. But he’s dead. And I keep feeling called to be. I get why so many trans activists kill themselves. 

I want to make the world a better place. I do. But I don’t know if I’m cut out for it. I’m getting worse at taking care of myself and school? Don’t even get me started. I’ve been failing consistently since my last year of high school. I’m currently failing what’s supposed to be my second to last semester of college. Everyone thinks I’m lazy, but I can feel the physical block. My therapist says it’s almost definitely related to my cPTSD. But I don’t know what to do. She doesn’t know either.

I've been planning my end for years now.,"I always liked beauty. Probably the only thing that kept me from ending it all. But even it wasn't enough, isn't, most of the time. 
Sometimes the only thing that calms me is to plan how I'm going to do it. It came to a point that every time that I'm suicidal again the only thing stopping me is the complexity of the scene. I still don't have the right things, I can't go to the place, my hair isn't in the right length and etc. 
I never told anyone about it. I'm living between numbness and intense feelings that hurt too much. I feel like I'm wasting my privileges, I'm wasting my capacities, I don't want to, I don't know what to do. The best phases are when I'm hyper, but I get destructive and it's not ideal. 
I miss xanax but I'm tired of numbing it down. I'm tired of living like a nun, I'm tired of always having to control myself so much when I feel something. 
And I ask myself what is going to happen the day I have everything ready. Sometimes I wish it was today. Sometimes I just don't want to think about it.

Laying it out all there,"Hey everyone,

This is so weird that a Reddit board exists for this, but hey it does. I'm a 31 year old, who generally has a lot going for him on paper (good job, partner, lots of friends, supportive family, health, etc). With the job, there is one caveat, I don't know what I'm doing. For context purposes, I'm an accountant and have been one for almost a decade now. I was the kid who studied his butt off in school with the expectation that would pay off in the form of a good job, success etc. I was also one of those people that thought he was better than others, where deep down I wasn't. Really, everybody is special and unique in their own ways. Anyways, what I'm getting at is I feel I've put a lot of bad energy out there and it's all culminating into one big disaster over the past few months. That disaster being the realization that the skills that I say I have on paper I don't actually have in real life (somehow miraculously I got by the past 10 years) and now I don't know what to do. Over the past few months I haven't been sleeping, barely getting anything done at work and overall feel like the end is near. I've had suicide ideation since I was a 15 coupled with worrying about death in general. Anyways, not sure what I expect to get out of posting this, but just wanted to share my situation.

"A kink in my suicide plan, not sure what to do","I'm a useless freeloader who's never, not for a single second, done or said anything of use.

No funeral costs, huge sum of money, and a freeloader off their back for good.

I don't actually know if the plan would work, I haven't researched it much obvs 

Except now I know it definitely won't work because I just learned that I don't have life insurance... and I'm sure it would look hella suspicious if I had a policy taken out on me only to die a few days later...

Living with constant anxiety,"I've slowly killed myself over the past decade. Would smoke 5 spliffs and a pack of cigarettes per day and only eat garbage. I'm 27 now.

I now constantly live with the fear of getting cancer. I had a severe mental breakdown of about 2 to 3 months with high level anxiety, stress and regrets. I now worry that this period gave me cancer too. 

This is no life. I can't do this anymore. I'm convinced I'll get cancer.

I’m so tired of it all,"It’s your average story everyone’s heard: no friends, broken family, bullied throughout elementary and high school, rough breakup, only escapes through drugs and self harm. I just can’t take it anymore i feel so worthless, I’m turning 18 this year and i think i can no longer go on like this i’ve wanted to die since i was 11. why is life so painful every day is a constantly struggle for me and i can’t even find motivation to keep going on. I cant even picture myself as an adult, i see nothing. These are all just words i cant even put together properly without autocorrect cause i’m crying too much, i just want to feel okay. How does being loved feel like? I’ve only felt it once with someone who changed their mind and started caring about somebody else in that particular way and broke off all contact with me. I’m so tired of people giving me “tough love” and saying my decisions are selfish, i know i am, it’s just making it worst. I just want it all to stop, but it never did. “It gets better” is burned into my mind but when does it? I’ve been trying so hard to continue on and make improvements but it always ends back at square one.

I need to know,"For a few years now i’ve been having these 4-5 month periods of just malaise and insecurity. I feel so selfish writing this. My parents refuse to get me tested for depression, So i can’t say that I have it. I am ugly. No one wants to talk to me because i’m not cool enough. If they are seen with me theyre automatically labeled as un-cool. I hate everyone. theyre so fucking selfish and fake. To me it hurts more to be rejected by a potential friend than a potential girlfriend. The only friends I have see that i’m sad or im not motivated, and they try and force me to open up, and when they finally force me to they try to become my therapist. Then I become a burden to them and they feel the need to check up on me. And then they use my problems against me if I make them mad. I am so fucking selfish and everyone lies to me. Recently one of my only friends, a girl, i fell in love with, backstabbed me. She had been for many months now. I confessed my love for her 7 months ago and we’ve been “more than friends” for a while.. I realized that she only did this because she felt bad for me. She leaked my affectionate love notes and my personal problems to my only friends, who then laughed at me, called me a simp and stopped talking to me. I’m too affectionate with people. My past relationships have always failed because i’m not a strong independent man. I’m a needy baby when it comes to the relationship and no girl wants a needy baby let alone an ugly fuck like me. I see girls at my school who look exactly like the girl who backstabbed me and it fucking eats me away inside knowing I have no chance. I want out. I just want to press escape and quit. I’m too scared to jump off a building and I only would feel comfortable with a gun. But I don’t know if this is for real or just angst..? I just want to stop going to school everyday seeing everyone have friends, girlfriends, good looks, making experiences knowing I cant achieve that.

I don't know what the point is I can't do this anymore,"Every morning I wake up, REALLY wishing I didn't wake up. Everyday honestly feels SO difficult to get through to the point where I have almost no energy any longer. I cannot find pleasure in anything and the idea of having to do this any longer really makes me lose it. I am so scared to end my own life because I'm worried it won't work and I'll turn out even worse than I already am. I can't handle the loneliness, the isolation, the constant DEMAND to work day in and day out and make money just to pay bills just to feel this fucking awful all day long. No one truly cares about me and they only want to keep me here for their own selfish reasons. Why can't assisted suicide for mental health be legal? I have called crisis line multiple times daily recently and I'm just ready to overdose on fentanyl.

Feeling stuck living with manipulative parents,"I’m having doubts about wanting to keep going. I just turned 25, I’m a girl from the US who is disabled (I have depression, BPD, anxiety, ADD and I have bad tremors as a result of these issues) and my parents treat me like I’m a little girl. I have not worked a proper job very much in my life and I’m a little immature for my age. 

Basically, where I am now, I feel mentally and physically unwell to work - the tremors go in and out and I collapse of exhaustion at least twice a month from them. My parents, my mum especially- are pressuring me to work, she gives me jobs I know I wouldn’t be able to handle and I apply to them to make her happy, though I never hear back. She is a social worker and when I say I’m too unwell to work she goes *”I’ve worked with people with Down’s syndrome, who were severely disabled, they had jobs.”* or *”I worked with a schizophrenic woman once, that’s worse than what you have, and she held down a 9 to 5 job.”* and so fourth. I think I should be on disability but my mum sees that as “giving up” and says that they won’t accept me because I “haven’t showed signs of trying” IE my small work history - the majority of money I’ve made over the years is from my music, but that comes few and far between.
Because I don’t have a job, my mum makes it my “job” in the house to be the only person who ever cleans our cats’ litter box, and when my tremors are going this is bad because I can’t hold the bag straight and I get litter and cat droppings everywhere, but she’s so insistent on sticking it to me that I’m not working that this doesn’t matter. 
I Have two girlfriends, my parents only know I’m dating one of them. One lives in Canada, I have wanted to run away there but my mum said if I even tried to visit her she would get Canadian police to come get me since I’m mentally unwell (my Canadian girlfriend also struggles with that and my parents like her but says she’s a “basket case” and that I shouldn’t  date her) but I  kinda don’t have a passport anyway.

My other girlfriend lives in the Midwest US and my mum says if I moved there I’d never contact the family ever again even though I told her I would, and that I would become ungrateful towards my girlfriend and get an “attitude” with her - my parents say I have a short temper but I’m quite mellow, it’s just that years of verbal abuse from my father - who to his credit is finally doing something about this - has gotten me very damaged.


Anyways, I like tried to stab myself in the stomach but was stopped and the knife was taken from me. I feel  stuck, and I really want to keep going but it’s getting really difficult. I don’t want to break my girlfriends’ hearts. I don’t know what to do anymore. I don’t know if I’m just unstable or if my parents are really mistreating me.",Dr_Deirdre_Airlines,2,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/fddtuk/feeling_stuck_living_with_manipulative_parents/,doubt wanting keep going turned 25 girl u disabled depression bpd anxiety add bad tremor result issue parent treat like little girl worked proper job much life little immature age basically feel mentally physically unwell work tremor go collapse exhaustion least twice month parent mum especially pressuring work give job know able handle apply make happy though never hear back social worker say unwell work go worked people syndrome severely disabled job worked schizophrenic woman worse held 9 5 job fourth think disability mum see giving say accept showed sign trying ie small work history majority money made year music come far job mum make job house person ever clean cat litter box tremor going bad hold bag straight get litter cat droppings everywhere insistent sticking working matter two girlfriend parent know dating one one life canada wanted run away mum said even tried visit would get canadian police come get since mentally unwell canadian girlfriend also struggle parent like say basket case date kinda passport anyway girlfriend life midwest u mum say moved never contact family ever even though told would would become ungrateful towards girlfriend get attitude parent say short temper quite mellow year verbal abuse father credit finally something ha gotten damaged anyways like tried stab stomach wa stopped knife wa taken feel stuck really want keep going getting really difficult want break girlfriend heart know anymore know unstable parent really mistreating,feeling stuck living manipulative parent,dr deir dre airline,2785,46,dr deir dre airline doubt wanting keep going turned 25 girl u disabled depression bpd anxiety add bad tremor result issue parent treat like little girl worked proper job much life little immature age basically feel mentally physically unwell work tremor go collapse exhaustion least twice month parent mum especially pressuring work give job know able handle apply make happy though never hear back social worker say unwell work go worked people syndrome severely disabled job worked schizophrenic woman worse held 9 5 job fourth think disability mum see giving say accept showed sign trying ie small work history majority money made year music come far job mum make job house person ever clean cat litter box tremor going bad hold bag straight get litter cat droppings everywhere insistent sticking working matter two girlfriend parent know dating one one life canada wanted run away mum said even tried visit would get canadian police come get since mentally unwell canadian girlfriend also struggle parent like say basket case date kinda passport anyway girlfriend life midwest u mum say moved never contact family ever even though told would would become ungrateful towards girlfriend get attitude parent say short temper quite mellow year verbal abuse father credit finally something ha gotten damaged anyways like tried stab stomach wa stopped knife wa taken feel stuck really want keep going getting really difficult want break girlfriend heart know anymore know unstable parent really mistreating feeling stuck living manipulative parent
"I have nothing, I am nothing","I'm 18 years old. I lost my car and my job. I had to move in with my boyfriend as a last resort but I'm very close to him kicking me out. My boyfriend resents me for moving in with him. I have nowhere else to go after that.

I'm 3 months away from graduation but in order to tolerate school I have to show up high as a kite. So many people there hate me. The work is just piling up and I cry in class almost once a week it seems.

I had one shot at a decent job and I didn't get it. There's nowhere else near me where I can apply. But my boyfriend got a job at the same place.

I'm volatile and emotional. I hurt everyone around me. I've driven everyone away. I have literally, and I mean literally, no one. I don't know why I'm like this. All I do is make other's lives hell.

Fuck I want to die. I want to die as painfully as I can. I want to be flayed, burned, and disemboweled. It's what I deserve in life. I've caused so much pain for everyone around me.

life after suicide attempt just feels weird,"I’m in my last year of compulsory school. I tried to kill myself by taking an overdose of prescription pain medication. But I failed miserably. I thought that life would return to normal but everything is fucked up. 

Everyone is acting weird around me, home is uncomfortable, I’ve been labelled as a ‘vulnerable student’, I use to have free periods which I used to spend hanging with my friends or chilling in empty classrooms - they’ve all been taken away and I’ve now been timetabled in for compulsory ‘supervised studies’ EVERYDAY, I’m not allowed to leave school during break or lunches because they need to make sure I’m ‘safe’. It’s so fucking embarrassing. 

My school is telling all my teachers that I’m ‘vulnerable’ that I shouldn’t be asked questions during lesson, and should be allowed to take ‘breaks’. My social worker came to visit today. My parents told my younger sister about my attempt without my fucking knowledge. CAMHS booked me in for an appointment despite me turning 18 in 2 months. 

Everyone just acts fucking weird around me. 

My parents who are both narcs all of a sudden want to start being caring and started telling everyone who asked the reason I attempted suicide was because I got rejected from my top university choice - it really and truly was NOT the reason I felt like I needed to die. 

I tried telling one of my friends about my attempt, and I mentioned in passing that I had my stomach pumped. She started asking me what it feels like and whether or not they replace the substance removed from your stomach like it was fucking cool or something. It was just insensitive. 

I can’t bare the awkwardness. I just feel very trapped and everything just feels so strange. I don’t know what to do and everything just feels so fucked up. I don’t want any special treatment.

This month I've got the rent covered but now don't have enough money for the power bill, my car payment, and my car insurance ad again I'm left panicking and stressing about where I'm going to get the money and what's going to happen. I'm starting a new job in three weeks but that doesn't help me right now. It's so depressing and I honestly feel like killing myself sometimes over it. I wake up dreading what the day holds and it's horrible. My parents don't believe me when I tell them I'm depressed and won't help me with money because they think I should learn through struggling.

My boyfriend tried to kill himself and I don’t know if I should stay with him,"My boyfriend and I have been in a long distance relationship since about five months now. We’ve known each other for much longer but just as uni started we realised that we wanted to date each other. Just recently, his close cousin died in a car crash. His father who passed away when he was about 14 also died in a car crash. Yesterday, I found out from his sister that he was in the hospital due to a car accident. Now presuming how much I knew that this accident affected him, I believe that he purposely did it. He kept telling me how he was going to do something stupid and how everything felt crazy on the inside and I kept telling him that I loved him and that I needed him. His sister and family will hardly reply to me when I asked what’s going on and I don’t know even know what situation he’s in - dead, alive, coma?? It’s eating me up inside and I don’t know what to do about it. It seems like the best option is to just wait but that’s too agonising for me. Should I try to get over him or wait till I know what’s happened to him? I love him a lot but I’m unsure if he would be the same person after this and if we have an opportunity to live life together anymore. He’s disappeared at times before and it’s been every stressful for me- I break down constantly and don’t eat until I’m starving. I know it sounds like our relationship is unhealthy but he has been nothing but perfect and loving and caring - I believed until recent that I was ready to spend my whole life with him. However, I can hardly help or contact him in situations like this and I feel like I’m wasting my uni life running after someone that I’m not sure I even know anymore. Despite that I know breaking up with him will hurt a lot because I thought that I was in it for the long run.

I want to die even tho it feels like i have been dead for years.,"Hello everyone i just want to tell u about my depression , loneliness, and general feeling of wanting to end this life for good. I dont even know why im doing this, idk what im looking for by posting. So... im very ashamed of my problems to the point where i feel ashamed writing this to the strangers that i wont ever see in my life... Since like 15 years ago my problem has been bad breath... and i really mean bad... cant erase it even directly after i brushed my teeth ... i have been trying to heal this sickness for a long time now with little success. Been to many doctors (free health care) i dont live in the US. Obviously im unemployed and cant afford to pay for the doctor, i stopped trying to go to the doctors after one of the doctor just laughed at me and my sickness... not literally but i could just feel how he didnt care at all and gave me a vibe of 'its not a sickness go home' So imagine me struggling to even talk openly to the doctor about it and receiving the 'ur nuts not sick' threatment from him. Im sure for people that dont have this problem its hard to understand why is it so hard for me? Let me put it like that , how would u feel if u stepped in a shit and couldnt wipe it off?Would u be comfortable walking around? standing next to someone? talking to someone? Obviously i dont even need to talk for someone to smell it, breathing thru nose is like same result, i got anxiety just by standing to someone, going to the shop is like climbing mount everest for me. I will achieve nothing in this life, none will want to have anything to do with person who smells... none will ever take serious someone like that...

"Voyage, Voyage!","Yesterdays brawl is enough for me. Just another reason to do it, and to be honest main reason of all the bad things happening, it's better to be abandoned, rather than have a ""family"" like that, if you can even call 1 parent that hates you, and blames for everything, a ""family"". 

I must admit, it felt good to say what I said, and do what I did. It feels so good to know it's soon to be over, I fear death, and pain, but the peace that comes afterwards is what I have been waiting all my life, honest smile. 

It's moments like that, that we are waiting for, a spark that lights the shit up, and helps it explode.

Letter,"I have spent the past three days typing up a suicide letter, and as I near the end of it I find myself growing anxiety riddled and realizing how many people care enough about me in life that I felt the need to give an explanation to personally. 

So then I went back through and added a section for if I didn’t die by suicide, because part of me just doesn’t want to go through with it anymore after writing it, which I am pretty sure isn’t the point of a suicide letter but I care about them so much that I don’t want to imagine their faces when they read it. 

Everything has just been so hard recently, and I’m really tired both physically and emotionally. I am tired of all the losses, I am tired of classes, I am tired of the way some of my relationships are headed... I just want to rest and stop feeling so overwhelmed. I want to be there for my friends who are also struggling, one in particular who has been there for me more then anyone in my entire life and is potentially going through a similar problem as my own, but they haven’t been answering my text messages and I can only assume it’s because they don’t want to bother me. Now that I think about it, I never want to bother them either, which is why I bottle everything up. I wish society didn’t teach us that there are such things as “negative” emotions that need to be locked away from other people’s views. If we could all be honest with each other without feeling it’s a burden on those we love I wonder how many lives could be saved and how many deep conversations could be had with our loved ones. 

I just feel bad because if anything I just feel like I’m in the way of everyone else’s progress and just adding another problem on their mountain of problems. Everyone deserves better then me and I wish there was a way to get myself out the way that wouldn’t potentially hurt them more then I already am.",Hinatasamaa,0,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/fdfvri/letter/,spent past three day typing suicide letter near end find growing anxiety riddled realizing many people care enough life felt need give explanation personally went back added section die suicide part want go anymore writing pretty sure point suicide letter care much want imagine face read everything ha hard recently really tired physically emotionally tired loss tired class tired way relationship headed want rest stop feeling overwhelmed want friend also struggling one particular ha anyone entire life potentially going similar problem answering text message assume want bother think never want bother either bottle everything wish society teach u thing negative emotion need locked away people view could honest without feeling burden love wonder many life could saved many deep conversation could loved one feel bad anything feel like way everyone else progress adding another problem mountain problem everyone deserves better wish wa way get way potentially hurt already,letter,h sama,1877,6,h sama spent past three day typing suicide letter near end find growing anxiety riddled realizing many people care enough life felt need give explanation personally went back added section die suicide part want go anymore writing pretty sure point suicide letter care much want imagine face read everything ha hard recently really tired physically emotionally tired loss tired class tired way relationship headed want rest stop feeling overwhelmed want friend also struggling one particular ha anyone entire life potentially going similar problem answering text message assume want bother think never want bother either bottle everything wish society teach u thing negative emotion need locked away people view could honest without feeling burden love wonder many life could saved many deep conversation could loved one feel bad anything feel like way everyone else progress adding another problem mountain problem everyone deserves better wish wa way get way potentially hurt already letter

I probably wont make it to my 20s,"I'm a teenage boy, soon 18 years old and I am not doing well at all.

Most tragic thing that keeps bothering me on daily basis is that few months ago me and my exgirlfiend were still in a happy relationship. I saw myself sharing a future with her. I might have committed too much in the relationship, because it was something I always relied on. We had this weird phase of not talking much before breaking up. She constantly said she was busy with school work, family and hobbies. I believed her. She is a very work active person. One day, about few weeks ago she called me and said she thinks she is gay. I was heartbroken obviously. I still am. She has been seeing this girl a lot too. I cant stop thinking about the ''what ifs''.  What if she was secretly cheating on me? What if she never even loved me? What if she dated me out of pity for 2 whole years? I can barely sleep at night thinking about this.

Not only am I going through a rough heartbreak, I am also struggling with quite severe loneliness. It is hard for me to admit, because I enjoy being alone, but it does make sense that I am seriously lonely. Few months ago I stopped going to school and after consulting with teachers we decided that it is the best for me to do school work from home. I never leave the house to go see friends. Hell I don't even think they want to see me. I am pretty sure if I just ended my life not many people would even remember me. My online friends cant even play video games with me, which would mean a lot if I could for once just do something fun with other people.

I am currently seeing a therapist. She has seen me at my worst. I never told her I was suicidal, but I'm sure she might know that already. My only solutions I can think of to get out of this hell is medication and waiting for some kind of a miracle to happen. If that doesn't work I really cannot see myself making it to my 20s or 30s. It sucks because I do want to live, but living with depression, loneliness, anxiety, heartbreak and all that kind of bs doesn't sounds worth it to me. I am going to end up being even more lonely soon once I move out. In a way that is good, because once I end it all even less people will be sad over it. I wont hurt others by going away.",samuele531,5,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/fdfdr5/i_probably_wont_make_it_to_my_20s/,teenage boy soon 18 year old well tragic thing keep bothering daily basis month ago exgirlfiend still happy relationship saw sharing future might committed much relationship wa something always relied weird phase talking much breaking constantly said wa busy school work family hobby believed work active person one day week ago called said think gay wa heartbroken obviously still ha seeing girl lot cant stop thinking ifs wa secretly cheating never even loved dated pity 2 whole year barely sleep night thinking going rough heartbreak also struggling quite severe loneliness hard admit enjoy alone doe make sense seriously lonely month ago stopped going school consulting teacher decided best school work home never leave house go see friend hell even think want see pretty sure ended life many people would even remember online friend cant even play video game would mean lot could something fun people currently seeing therapist ha seen worst never told wa suicidal sure might know already solution think get hell medication waiting kind miracle happen work really cannot see making 20 30 suck want live living depression loneliness anxiety heartbreak kind b sound worth going end even lonely soon move way good end even le people sad wont hurt others going away,probably wont make 20,samuel e 531,2241,33,samuel e 531 teenage boy soon 18 year old well tragic thing keep bothering daily basis month ago exgirlfiend still happy relationship saw sharing future might committed much relationship wa something always relied weird phase talking much breaking constantly said wa busy school work family hobby believed work active person one day week ago called said think gay wa heartbroken obviously still ha seeing girl lot cant stop thinking ifs wa secretly cheating never even loved dated pity 2 whole year barely sleep night thinking going rough heartbreak also struggling quite severe loneliness hard admit enjoy alone doe make sense seriously lonely month ago stopped going school consulting teacher decided best school work home never leave house go see friend hell even think want see pretty sure ended life many people would even remember online friend cant even play video game would mean lot could something fun people currently seeing therapist ha seen worst never told wa suicidal sure might know already solution think get hell medication waiting kind miracle happen work really cannot see making 20 30 suck want live living depression loneliness anxiety heartbreak kind b sound worth going end even lonely soon move way good end even le people sad wont hurt others going away probably wont make 20
"Joining the sub, since I probably have no reason left to live","For context, I’m 19, in my first year of college, and for one month - since I failed one of my exams - I lost everything I thought I had. All my friends, my crush, and for a week now, my Dad, who just wants to be upset at me forever for not helping him to the end with carrying some construction material.

For one month, I’ve entered a downward spiral, amplified by events such as the rejection mentioned earlier, or not being able to give the license exam two days ago because of some stupid policemen who told me that I “didn’t pay the license tax” correctly. And not being able to make up with my Dad, who just hates me.

The final straw came an hour ago, when I got laughed at when I entered the classroom. Just because I happened to enter at the same time as some other older students who didn’t belong there.
When I left the college, no one noticed.

It is probably a matter of weeks or even days before I take my life. Nothing is worth it. Nothing makes me happy. Nothing can save me now. Nothing. And what’s more, no one (apart from probably my mother and sister) won’t miss me. But let’s be serious, they’ll live without me. And also, I’m sure no one will notice this post, in the heap of posts of people with more serious life issues. 

This is really what makes me a failure: not being able to live happily in a life which would seem ok to most people here.

I'm drinking myself to death and it is causing my family to be upset,"The reason I drink is to self medicate because I saw my friend pass away in a car accident when I was 19. We were both stupid and I challenged him to a race using our parents cars. Basically, he understeered into a tree. I have tried therapy but it didn't work for me. I was also diagnosed with PTSD and depression. I stopped taking my prescription because it didn't work for me. I feel that I have blood on my hands because I was the one who made him do it. 

My parents and grandfather came to me and told me that they were worried about my drinking problem. I sometimes drink a bottle of Vodka a day. I just want to drink myself to death because I'm too scared of killing myself. My granddad tried to relate to the situation by telling me about the things he was in Vietnam. I walked out because I was upset about everything. I now think that I was out of order and I would do anything to apologise.

Everything's been so hard after the psych ward.,"Throwaway, because all my friends and such know my account. I know they care, and that's what hurts me the most.

My head has always been a conflicting cloud of thoughts.

I keep thinking if I were to die, maybe everybody would be happier. Maybe I'll stop being such a fuck up. Maybe everybody would think of me as this better version of myself after I'm gone.

I'm young, and I know there's so much ahead for me, that maybe one day things will get better. But it's been so incredibly hard, and I don't think I can do it anymore. My stay at the psych ward made me behind in school, it made me feel selfish for wanting to work on myself, that I was causing pain for others.

I sometimes think that maybe if I was gone, people wouldn't need to worry anymore.

I wouldn't need to go chat to certain people to feel better.

I wouldn't stay in bed and cry all day about how much I just want to disappear.

I've been thinking about hanging myself, but after reading about how much it gets fucked up, I'm starting to think of a different method.

I don't know.

Am I a bad person?,"My Step-Grandmother, who has been extremely abusive and toxic to myself and my Mother all of our lives got diagnosed with cancer last year. It’s not terminal at this time. However, she has required us to dedicate much of our time to her. She no longer has a car for whatever reason so I am forced to drive her around all day, everyday. My Mother has to grocery shop for her constantly and buy her food constantly. She is still extremely abusive and no matter how much I help out, she still abuses me and it’s never enough. She resents my Grandfather for passing away earlier in his life even though he died in his sleep of a heart attack. Before he passed she was still extremely abusive. But it’s now at an all time high because of her condition. Does it make me a bad person for wanting her to die so we can finally be at peace?

I'm just so tired.,"It's 4 am for me. Stuck alone in my room with my thoughts and I don't know why I'm even posting about any of this but I just have no one to turn too.

A little background information about me to help paint a picture. I'm 21 and gay and I am depressed, alone, filled with anxiety, and extremely suicidal. There really hasn't been a day that has gone by where I don't think about killing myself, negative thoughts about myself, just bursting into tears alone in my room or just in public.

The pain that I am feeling is completely unbearable, I'm just so tired of even living and moving forward in this life when I just don't think worth it. My whole life I just have been faced with pain and pain and pain again and I just keep trying and I'm just so tired. I'm tired of this life. Tired of the pain and just tired with myself.

I have come to the realization that no matter what I do, no matter how hard I try, or how hard I try to become someone else. I just will never be good enough, that has always been what my life has been about. I don't even know who I am anymore, I look in the mirror and I just don't recognize who I am anymore let alone know who I am anymore. Sounds weird, I know. It's just I was never happy with who I was as a person and that always fucked me up then I try being other people and that always fucked me up so I just never win. It's just so fucking disheartening and gruesome to just always be put back in this hellish place of just never being enough, uglyness, trying so hard and getting fucked and this whole stupid ass existence.

I just don't see a future anymore. I don't want to see tomorrow anymore. I'm constantly wishing for death. Hoping I get run over by a car, get in an accident, OD on anything. Just something that will take this pain away.

I have been feeling this way for years and years and I just never seem to get a break, not even for a single moment. I am always brought back here. This is all I never know. I don't deserve love or happiness or even a glimpse of joy. I'm always there for others and I try my best to be supportive to show my love and care but when it come's to me I just don't get it.

I'm ready to go. I say that every day and yet I'm still here.... I don't know why that is though. But at the same time I just feel like i'm one step closer to pushing the trigger and ending it all. Sorry for my foolishness. I probably will delete. But hey if I ever end up doing it, my thoughts will be here.

Please remember this,"Okay, let me tell you something. This is not out of the blue or anything. This is from my experience as well others.
When someone attempts suicide or seems to show suicidal traits, you are not supposed to hit them with aggressive sentences like ""Are you crazy? What the fuck is wrong with you?"" and insensitive sentences like ""Maybe, try this, it will help you die easily"" or ""Suicide is for the cowards"".
For a moment, take a step back and stand in their shoes. Try to understand, why they took such a big step. Ask questions like ""Are you feeling fine?"" ""Are you okay?"" ""Do you wanna talk about it?"" and ""I'm always here"".
That's the sign of an emotionally mature person who knows what to say when.
Do not also try to justify their actions by comparing your pain to theirs. Their journey, their struggles, their hurt are absolutely different from yours. Their tolerance level is different. You're not doing any good by constantly showering comparisons in disguise of advices.

I hate encouragement,"(Disclaimer that I get suicidal ideation in a more ongoing ""casual"" form, so might not resonate with everyone.)

What I would give for someone to say, ""I understand you're struggling, and I will understand if you choose to end it.""

Even my friends who get suicidal ideation come from a perspective of it being something you'll get through. They talk about how meds have helped them. Or about how they've become more resilient. And they'll say they'll help and encourage you the whole way.

But I don't want someone to encourage me. I want someone to sit with me and say, ""Yeah that really sucks."" To say, ""It's okay if you can't handle it."" Or even, ""I'll help you end the pain.""

I wouldn't do anything, would never take them up on it. But it would be so incredibly validating. 

I want to be heard; I want to be understood. I'm on meds, I'm in therapy, I'm resilient. I know I'm doing all the right things.

I don't know what to do.,"I'm 28m, I moved back in with my parents when my house was sold out from under me.  I've been slowly deteriorating.  I've considered suicide since I was in middleschool.  And attempted sometimes halfheartedly, a handful of times.

&amp;#x200B;

I feel empty.  Like I don't belong.  I have been single for the last 6 years.  Not counting short relationships.  I haven't gone to college.  I have no desire to continue living.

&amp;#x200B;

When I was younger suicide was a strong but fleeting feeling.  It would hit me like a train but if I held on for long enough it would disappear like a light being switched off.  As I grow older it seems that those feelings that before were quick, are no constant.  Suicide is almost always on my mind.  And my determination to succeed seems to have strengthened.  


I have very little to complain about in life.  I have a job, I'm saving money.  I have some fantastic friends, and I live in a beautiful part of the world.  


I am alone though.  Every attempt I've made at having a relationship with a woman has failed.  Not always because of me.  But the feeling of being empty and alone is unbearable.  Partnership is hardwired into our dna and I seem to have been born into the perfect brain for avoiding it.

&amp;#x200B;

I just don't know what to do.  I want to end it.  I'm worried what it might do to my parents.  They are already on the  edge of a divorce that I believe has been coming since I was very young.  They have already shown themselves to be fairly incapable when it comes to helping me with my mental issues.  They knew I had ADD as a child but did nothing about it.  Hoping it would go away.  They've taken me to therapy for my depression, but I find it difficult to be honest about my feelings when I'm face to face with someone.  Because the few times I have been, it has lead to a response consisting of distance, and alienation, not compassion or empathy.  And even more often the simple words ""suck it up"".

&amp;#x200B;

I'm fairly sure I'll die by suicide.  Likely within the next few years.  My only goal is to try and patch up my relationships with family and loved ones so that  I can send myself off with the least amount of guilt possible.  I don't want to tear peoples lives apart.  I just wish I had never been born.  I don't feel lovable.  I don't feel as if I can really trust anyone.

&amp;#x200B;

I know I should fight it.  But after 28 years.  I don't know if I have the strength.  I just want to stop feeling alone, and empty.",Lucid_Sandwich,4,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/fd96d7/i_dont_know_what_to_do/,28m moved back parent house wa sold slowly deteriorating considered suicide since wa middleschool attempted sometimes halfheartedly handful time amp x200b feel empty like belong single last 6 year counting short relationship gone college desire continue living amp x200b wa younger suicide wa strong fleeting feeling would hit like train held long enough would disappear like light switched grow older seems feeling quick constant suicide almost always mind determination succeed seems strengthened little complain life job saving money fantastic friend live beautiful part world alone though every attempt made relationship woman ha failed always feeling empty alone unbearable partnership hardwired dna seem born perfect brain avoiding amp x200b know want end worried might parent already edge divorce believe ha coming since wa young already shown fairly incapable come helping mental issue knew add child nothing hoping would go away taken therapy depression find difficult honest feeling face face someone time ha lead response consisting distance alienation compassion empathy even often simple word suck amp x200b fairly sure die suicide likely within next year goal try patch relationship family loved one send least amount guilt possible want tear people life apart wish never born feel lovable feel really trust anyone amp x200b know fight 28 year know strength want stop feeling alone empty,know,lucid sandwich,2509,24,lucid sandwich 28m moved back parent house wa sold slowly deteriorating considered suicide since wa middleschool attempted sometimes halfheartedly handful time amp x200b feel empty like belong single last 6 year counting short relationship gone college desire continue living amp x200b wa younger suicide wa strong fleeting feeling would hit like train held long enough would disappear like light switched grow older seems feeling quick constant suicide almost always mind determination succeed seems strengthened little complain life job saving money fantastic friend live beautiful part world alone though every attempt made relationship woman ha failed always feeling empty alone unbearable partnership hardwired dna seem born perfect brain avoiding amp x200b know want end worried might parent already edge divorce believe ha coming since wa young already shown fairly incapable come helping mental issue knew add child nothing hoping would go away taken therapy depression find difficult honest feeling face face someone time ha lead response consisting distance alienation compassion empathy even often simple word suck amp x200b fairly sure die suicide likely within next year goal try patch relationship family loved one send least amount guilt possible want tear people life apart wish never born feel lovable feel really trust anyone amp x200b know fight 28 year know strength want stop feeling alone empty know

Give me one reason to carry on with a life where I have been missing out on almost every joy imaginable.,"I never had a best friend. I'd never been part of a friend group. Or *a* group for that matter. I never felt accepted, not at my temporary job as a waiter, not in online chats, not in my class. Never had a girlfriend. Never kissed. Never had sex. Never had someone compliment me. Never had an unforgettable holiday trip. Never had a memorable spring break or summer break. Never went to a cool festival. Never had a great party. Never hosted one either. The list goes on and on and on. I feel lonely and my depression is physically weighing down on me. I have no motivation to do anything any more and my parents say they can read that off my face. 

I legit cannot remember the last time I had fun. Why would I even bother going on like this when I feel like I am just surviving each day rather than living. I am almost tempted to move to another country, start anew, and just go entirely crazy, but I feel like I would carry on the same way and be even more depressed. Everyone around me has so much fun but me. Last week I overheard two normal guys around my age discussing their plans for the summer and some crazy memories.

I don't know who to talk to anymore...,"When I was around 6-7 y.o my dad got a scholarship in Australia. I was really happy to be there. I was someone who had lots of friends, exceptional grades, etc. But that turned 180° once I came back from Australia to my home country..I just don't know why.

Junior high was pretty average execpt my grades were starting to fall and I got the occasional teasing because I had a 'different' English accent. Then come high school when everything hit real hard. 

My grades were below par, my dad didn't allow me to hang out with friends, he started being a heli parent and would make irrational night curfews. I also got into numerous trouble with school. 

Over time, what I thought were my friends left me one by one. They even spread a rumor that I was gay (a big no in my country). And to top it off, my girlfriend cheated on me. I felt so desolate and unwanted. Ever since that I became socially awkward and has started to stutter/mumble in my speech. I thought about jumping off a roof but canceled

Eventually I just ate my depression and loneliness while at the same time gaining 10 kilos off it making me obese.

Last year I got accepted to uni in a city away from home. It gave me my much needed liberty away from my dad. I tried making friends, did the usual stuff but was shrugged off being not 'cool' enough or was just a plain awkward person. It kills me looking people left and right are with their friends or s.o being happy while there I am walking by myself alone to sit in class alone again.

Being in uni also made my mind grow wild. I've thought of many different ways of how ordinary objects can be used to kill me. I've tried swerving my motorbike onto an oncoming 18 wheeler but was too scared. I also bought a rope..a decision to use it thats been back and forth.

I hate those damn Ubiquitous Suicide Hotline Posters.,"People need to realise and understand just how much bullshit suicide prevention is.

Because Yes, lets put posters to the suicide hotline a bit everywhere, look, we're only helping!

The suicide hotline! yes ! of course! why didn't I think of that?

All those things are there to make other people happy and fool them into thinking ""They're doing a great job helping!""  
You're really not.

How about this one? Force them to seek counselling  
Ah yes! Because talking about how I feel is going to make my problems go away! Of course  
Well, you'll get tools to /cope/ with those things, see -  
Oh! but it won't resolve any of the underlying issues, I see, you're only treating the symptoms of flesh eating  disease.

Institutionalisation?  
Well, how about fuck you Sheryl. Because isolating me even more really is going to help.  
But YOU can rest assured that /you did everything you could/! Look! the problem is no longer visible to you!
So therefore it must be working!   
Pat yourself on the shoulder, you did a great job!   
That person surely isn't going to fold into themselves even more than they already have
as they just sit around looking at blank walls, waiting for there next therapy session with doctors that are too rushed  
or overworked to care or do any good.  
It's like facing the corner for ""adults"". Think nice and hard about what you did! See you in three weeks!  

Well, how about numbing him AND therapy?   
Listen Maribeth, why do you think that's going to work? Because there's an entire industry around it?   
That must mean it HAS to be successful! Everyone! Everytime! Guaranteed!  
Surely it can ONLY /help/ those poor depressed souls, because the good doctor and the books say that it works
Surely their one follow-up call to re-make an appointment will change everything when they failed to show up  
Well, they didn't want to be here, on to someone that actually WANTS to be helped  
And the cycle... continues  

Surely taking pills to numb me to force me to sit in emotional comatose will   
Cure me of my autoimmune disease that will end me prematurally anyways  
Find me nice stable jobs that can work around my frequent and random stays at the hospital  
Stop jobs from firing me for invalid reasons because of it  
And extinguish an innumerable amount of very real fires in my life that set me down this path in the first place  

1.  
[Morris Moss: *picks up flaming fire extinguisher* I'll just put this over here... with the rest of the fire.](https://img.picturequotes.com/2/84/83812/ill-just-put-this-over-here-with-the-rest-of-the-fire-quote-1.jpg)

can't people see why it doesn't work? why I push people away  
Even though I really really REALLY don't want to  
And it only hurts me even more  
permanently scaring the relationships that matter most to me  
never able to go back to how things were before  
inevitably helping me push myself to take the final jump  
when there is no one left around me  
when they all finally shut me out  
and none of them bother to reach out or care anymore  
or know that I finally jumped  

I feel stuck, Like an atom stuck on a plateau, trying to Fuse   
the only way to unlock my potential energy would be through quantum tunneling   
But you need to put outside energy in the system for it to work  
The only power that does work, is a firm grasping hand from ones we love the most,  
holding on with all their might despite the weight trying to sink ever deeper  
And the mightiest of tugs, going through that hill  
Holding on, as hard as they can, as they careen down the quantum waterfall in a burst of energy  

Not some stupid fucking poster.


and then what?

I have a truck, an apartment to myself, a cat, and a decently paying job (I'm surviving, ha). I just feel so goddamn lonely.

"Thanks dad, you really helped. You're a genius. I'm cured.","So when your child's suicidal, self-harming, chronically depressed, and suffering abuse while you're away from the house, the obvious solution is to tell her that she's lying about everything and just needs to study harder because grades = good degree = good job = no more depresso. 

&amp;#x200B;

Wow. Genius, dad. I just need to stop FEELING and study my ass off. It makes so much sense. Why didn't I think of that?

&amp;#x200B;

And when I'm on the balcony crying and so close to jumping and you change the subject to this semester's grades again, I guess that's good too! Of course, grades are all that matter. 

&amp;#x200B;

And mom, I guess hating your child for being broken by your abuse is logical too! I  mean, how dare I make you feel bad by crying and trying to hang myself after you shook me and screamed in my face and told me I was no longer in the family? That's just what a child deserves for saying she doesn't love you! You're so damn right!

&amp;#x200B;

Where the hell did you think this was gonna go?

Did you actually think your idiocy would keep me alive?

Did you think you could fuck me up and then take all the credit when I claw my way to the top despite your best efforts to kill me?

I want to talk to someone, anyone, with a desperate fervour. The subject doesn't matter, as long as the person is interested in talking to me.

I honestly can't remember a time when I *didn't* feel so alone, but lately it seems to have gotten even worse. Even people whom I once thought my friends seem to have lost any interest in me. I want to talk to *someone.*
But I also can't tell anyone about this, because I worry that they will only speak to me out of pity or a misguided sympathy.

I do not want either of those, I can not stand the mere thought of them. 
All I want, is to be genuinely liked.

My (25m) wife (24f) broke down crying today and confessed she has wanted to kill herself for the past three months. I don't know what to do.,"As the title says. I'd like to tag her reddit account but am unsure if that breaks any rules. I believe the only reason she is holding back is fear of what would happen to our 1year old son. She has attempted before in the past before we were married.

 Saying the last few months has been unkind to my family is a severe understatement. Lost my job and couldn't find work for several months that eventually led to our recent eviction. As a result, I've been forced to return to long haul truck driving so I am unable to physically be there for her while she stays at her extremely mentally abusive parents home. I've managed to secure her a better place to stay with a friend of mine and even a place for our dog, but thats the limit of what I can do. I'm bad at feelings, but I'm a good listener, and I am completely lost how to handle the situation. She wants to run away and feels as though she drowning. That nobody cares or doesn't want to notice. I am afraid she came forward to me today because she is getting ready to follow through, and I'm over a thousand miles away with no way home and *completely* out of my depth.

What has worked for you in the past? How do you feel better when you’ve been beaten into submission again? What do you do? How do you distract yourself? How do you avoid these dark tendencies?

Am I depressed?,"I'll try to be as transparent as possible without revealing too much. I am a high school senior, about to graduate in \~3 months. It feels like my life has been defined by the pressure to get good grades; and while I have done decently well in that regard, it has come at the expense at my social life and a lot of other things I value. I used to love the sport I played; now it feels like a burden to even show up to practice. I feel the same way about the other extracurricular activities I'm involved in. I've been rejected to several colleges/programs already, some of which I thought I had a decent shot at getting into. Occasionally, I have what I think are real suicidal impulses, but I know that I'm too much of a fucking pussy to do anything about it. The closer and closer I get to graduation, the lower my work ethic stoops, and the worse I feel about the utterly pathetic excuse of a human being that I now am. The reason why I'm confused is because occasionally, I have moments where I enjoy myself. Where I enjoy life.

My first post,"I have been diagnosed with major depression and anxiety years ago. Hi, I'm a 41 year old male with a good job, make good money, why should I be hurting? Depression, anxiety and suicide runs in my family. I have been committed to a 72 hour hold twice for being suicidal and planning my suicide. I do self harm. I think about suicide weekly, sometimes daily. I don't want medication but I self medicate with alcohol, work obsession or high risk sports. I'm embarrassed because I can't fit in with life, I'm broken with no fix. I suffer in silence as I don't want to bother my family, friends and girlfriend. I have planned my suicide many times, even tonight. Yes, I have written many suicide notes as well.

If I tell someone, they lock me up without shoelaces. This is not what I need, this causes me to hide it even more. I'm broken with no fix. I already go through cycles of being numb, angry, and sad. I don't want to feel numb from medication (I've been there before, what is the purpose.). I don't trust anyone to talk about this with, they respond with ways that make me hide my what I truly feel.

I want this pain to stop, the pain I've been feeling for years. Why am I broken? Besides not waking up, I don't know what else is the answer. I understand why my family member committed suicide, I get it, it isn't selfish, it is to stop the pain that many can't understand.

I don't know what to do. Do I end it, hide in silence and keep everyone happy, or say something and be even more miserable and in turn become more numb? Who really cares? I know alcohol doesn't help, but it helps me sleep, or if I don't drink here I am wide awake trying to make my brain quiet. I do high risk sports, secretly hoping that I will die.

I spent last night at the emergency room alone, I didn't contact my family, friends and erased a message for my girlfriend (I wasn't sure if it was a heart attack and didn't want to die alone but didn't want to bother anyone). My girlfriend saw some erased messages, so I told my girlfriend that it was some chest pain I wanted to make sure wasn't anything, I never told my family or friends and never will.

I don't know what to do, I need this to stop. This is my cycle, I'm numb or angry at everyone and push everyone way. If I wake up tomorrow, I will think whoever wrote this is an idiot and stupid, numb and ignorant to the pain I feel. Cycle repeats.

so long and thanks for all the fish,"I really want to die. I just don't have it in me to go on any longer. Every single day is pain. And I have really lost my patience to go through it all. This world is just too much. I just can't make myself heard. No one listens. No one understands my fears, my pain. I am tired of begging the ones close to me to understand me. It more than often seems that I am just a burden that they are carrying, and until everything is right with me, they are right, when something goes wrong with me and I need their help, they take up arms against me. I am very tired of all this. I am tired of this life. I don't want to live any more. There is absolutely no joy in my life, just pretence. Every smile is a pretence, every laugh is a sham trying to hide the screams I am screaming inside. And it has been going on for years now. I am so tired. If I were numb, I could have lived through any pain for a long long time, but unfortunately I am sensitive as fuck. I don't know how not to get affected by my mind. I don't know how not to get affected by all the rubbish overthinking that I do. It is all my fault. All my fault. I am a crack. I don't fit here amidst all these perfection, who just can't take my imperfection. I am so tired Maa. Come take me. I want to go back to you. I have had enough with this world. It has been such a long time since the warmth of your void. There was no pain. Nothing to cry the whole night about. No night. No day. Nothing. I was just nothing like you Maa. Why did I have to come here? I couldn't have asked for a life like this, where my own mind becomes my enemy, and I sit like a mute observer, unable to change anything. Just watching and suffering every consequences on this body which won't even be with me when I leave. Why do I suffer so much? What have I done to deserve so much pain? Have I given someone this much pain in life? Maybe I have. And maybe it is all coming back to me. So I beg you, whoever you are that makes all things go.. give it all to me once. Give all of whatever pain you have kept for me, all at once. And release me from this shell. I do not want it any more. I have no use for such an existence.

"Life is going nowhere, can’t walk, feel like a huge disappoitment and a burden.","Hey Reddit. I’ve been debating posting on here for a while but I’m having more suicidal thoughts than ever before and I just need to get this all of my chest. I’m 32, male. I have an amazing girlfriend who is way out of my league and a fun job I enjoy and yet, here I am. 

Despite having some really good parts of my life, I’m slammed by thoughts of being worthless and just living a pointless existence. I’m in debt up to my eyeballs and my credit is trashed. I feel like despite getting a $15,000 raise at work, I’m still nowhere near where I want to be at this point in my life. I feel like I have no tangible future and am just waiting to die one day. In the past 4 years I’ve lost my father and my grandmother, two of the most influential people in my life. I’m in the process of moving but am having a difficult time finding good apartments because of my credit so Ive been forced to stay with my mom until I’m settled. I travel for my job and my car is falling apart but I don’t have good replacement options again because of the credit issue. I’m ridden with anxiety about everything and fear of future issues prevents me from enjoying the now. To top it all off, I was visiting my girlfriend this weekend who lives a few hours away from me and I severely inured my knee and I can’t walk. I have to find a surgeon and probably have an operation and she wants to take care of me hand and foot but it just makes me feel like I’m a giant burden. She’s so amazing and I feel like I don’t offer anything financially and am just a 32 dependent who, as of right now can barely make it to the bathroom because of this damn leg. 

I am an atheist. I don’t believe in any form of an afterlife as I just can’t accept something with no evidence. I firmly believe in my heart that my grandmother and father are gone. Aside from their graves nothing remains of them and they are not in another realm enjoying themselves. All that exists for then is the black void of nothingness. And despite so many rays of sunshine in my dark life, I feel so envious of them. To not have to feel this anxiety and pain anymore is such an appealing feeling to me. This world is such a terrible place where ignorance and hate have run so rampant and people take such joy in hurting their fellow man. What future can society have with a foundation like this? I find myself thinking about ending everything on a near daily basis. I see lots of redditors posting here about how they are excited for some kind of afterlife because they can’t accept that this is the best we can do. But for me, an absence of anything would be as good as the existence of a heaven. 

I feel better having laid all this out in text but I still find myself objectively weighing the pros and cons of ending my life. So I don’t know what I was hoping for by posting this. Maybe I need someone to talk me off the ledge... who knows. But in all honestly, leaping from the ledge looks better and bettter with each passing minute...",Mimikyummy,1,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/fd9umt/life_is_going_nowhere_cant_walk_feel_like_a_huge/,hey reddit debating posting suicidal thought ever need get chest 32 male amazing girlfriend way league fun job enjoy yet despite really good part life slammed thought worthless living pointless existence debt eyeball credit trashed feel like despite getting 15 000 raise work still nowhere near want point life feel like tangible future waiting die one day past 4 year lost father grandmother two influential people life process moving difficult time finding good apartment credit ive forced stay mom settled travel job car falling apart good replacement option credit issue ridden anxiety everything fear future issue prevents enjoying top wa visiting girlfriend weekend life hour away severely inured knee walk find surgeon probably operation want take care hand foot make feel like giant burden amazing feel like offer anything financially 32 dependent right barely make bathroom damn leg atheist believe form afterlife accept something evidence firmly believe heart grandmother father gone aside graf nothing remains another realm enjoying exists black void nothingness despite many ray sunshine dark life feel envious feel anxiety pain anymore appealing feeling world terrible place ignorance hate run rampant people take joy hurting fellow man future society foundation like find thinking ending everything near daily basis see lot redditors posting excited kind afterlife accept best absence anything would good existence heaven feel better laid text still find objectively weighing pro con ending life know wa hoping posting maybe need someone talk ledge know honestly leaping ledge look better bettter passing minute,life going nowhere walk feel like huge disappoitment burden,mimi k yummy,2979,79,mimi k yummy hey reddit debating posting suicidal thought ever need get chest 32 male amazing girlfriend way league fun job enjoy yet despite really good part life slammed thought worthless living pointless existence debt eyeball credit trashed feel like despite getting 15 000 raise work still nowhere near want point life feel like tangible future waiting die one day past 4 year lost father grandmother two influential people life process moving difficult time finding good apartment credit ive forced stay mom settled travel job car falling apart good replacement option credit issue ridden anxiety everything fear future issue prevents enjoying top wa visiting girlfriend weekend life hour away severely inured knee walk find surgeon probably operation want take care hand foot make feel like giant burden amazing feel like offer anything financially 32 dependent right barely make bathroom damn leg atheist believe form afterlife accept something evidence firmly believe heart grandmother father gone aside graf nothing remains another realm enjoying exists black void nothingness despite many ray sunshine dark life feel envious feel anxiety pain anymore appealing feeling world terrible place ignorance hate run rampant people take joy hurting fellow man future society foundation like find thinking ending everything near daily basis see lot redditors posting excited kind afterlife accept best absence anything would good existence heaven feel better laid text still find objectively weighing pro con ending life know wa hoping posting maybe need someone talk ledge know honestly leaping ledge look better bettter passing minute life going nowhere walk feel like huge disappoitment burden

It took me attempting suicide to realise that I was right about nobody caring if I died.,"So last week everything got to me.

I've lost my son, wife, car, my home even and haven't eaten in 5 days as I have nothing to my name. Living off nothing but tap water for substance. I'm week and ill due to this.

My parents won't help, they say I'm a wimp for attempting.

My father said I was worthless and amount to nothing before offering to kick my face in for being a ""puff"" (rich as he's never worked in my entire life a day and mum's always provided for him while I've worked abroad, owned a home and much more but yeah).

My friends avoid me and don't want to hang around me, o only have a place to sleep thanks to my mother, but it's a rock hard floor and my father won't let me stay, eat or do anything there so in the day I'm cut lose to wonder the streets in the rain and cold. A problem as we've had a lot of major storms and even flooding here recently.

So last week I went to the lake I frequented as a child and hung myself. That was meant to be it. But in typical pathetic fashion I failed here too. The rope snapped.

I woke up a few minutes later, dizzy from the fall, unsure where I was due to the lack of oxygen. Eventually I recovered and went back to my parents to sleep. Wet, drenched, in pain and hungry. The next morning the abuse from my father began.

I'm 24 and I have nothing, only a few months ago I had everything and a newborn son. My ex wife took all that, took him thousands of miles away. I miss him more than anything.

"It comes in waves, but I’m really feeling it this time.","I have been dealing with depression since my mid-teens. It comes in waves. I go from a deep depression to a more mild feeling, but it’s always there. As I got older, the low tide began to stick around longer than the high tide. I have tried numerous prescriptions with no result, and no other form of therapy has caused the slightest change in the way I feel.

For the past year, I have lost all enjoyment in every aspect of my life. Usually this passes but this is the longest stretch I’ve had. It’s almost like I’ve come to some sort of acceptance that this is how I’m going to feel forever if I don’t end it.

The current climate of the world (I don’t mean Global Warming) has also pushed me the closest I’ve ever been to ending it. I used to enjoy movies, music, television and video games as a form of escape. I can’t enjoy them anymore. The hyper-politicalization of EVERYTHING has corroded away the enjoyment I received from the few things I used as an escape.

I am very good at hiding my feelings, and nobody knows about my thoughts and plans for suicide. My friends and coworkers all know me as an easy going, relaxed guy. I also don’t want them to know, so it’s a full time job on top of my job to keep it up, and it’s exhausting.

I made plans on how I would do it during my last low point, and I’m closer now than ever. I have all the means to pull it off, I just have to do it. 

I’m also not sure why I posted this. Maybe a way to flesh out a suicide note. I’ve been on reddit for years, but never posted.

You know when you finally ask for help and someone pretends to help you but doesn’t really?,"I’ve been suffering for years and just this November I decided to tell my parents and ask for help because I couldn’t find a therapist on my own and wanted help. They listened, said a lot of “the right things” but near the end of the discussion they summed it up to stress and school and activities and tried to “fix my problems”. They agreed to search for a therapist though and a couple days later even told me they found someone and were waiting on a call back. It’s been about 4 months and there’s been nothing. When I ask they only say they’re waiting on a call back. I just want help. It’s gotten progressively worse and worse.

I’m already a burden to everyone around me. I’m an inconvenience and my pain is over dramatic. I don’t have the right to complain and don’t want to annoy those around me by saying anything or accidentally letting on that something is up. The way I feel is disproportionate to the severity of my problems and I should be over it. Dying by COVID-19 would solve that, honestly.

Suicide or be abused?,"It just feels like life is a stack of endless abuse and trauma from being born. I would prefer not to spend my life friendless, alone, and bullied or abused for what seems like just being alive. And I’m sick of explaining what’s going on. No one is helpful and ppl think their lives and perspectives and view points are the only ones that seem to exists. Life is truly miserable I can’t even get out of bed anymore. I use to want to fight to be a musician. For what? To continue being abused and mistreated? Fucking hell where does this shit end.


I guess the real question is how do people find ways to live for something they don’t mind being abused for. Something that is more gratifying than actually suffering. For me it is making music and sharing it. That’s all. If I don’t blossom as an artists I can’t see any other way to make the pain worth fighting on for. I really need to focus on my music even if It kills me trying to reach my goals. What else is there for me to be alive for. I hate being abused and hate most things in life. Having a mediocre job isn’t worth being mistreated for. I have to die trying to do something from my wildest dreams or I will pull my plug. I’m just talking about myself.

just alone and confused,"In October, I was assaulted by my then ex-boyfriend. Even though we had broken up in August,  I had reached out to him because he was one of the few people who knew that it was the year anniversary of the first time I was assaulted. And then he raped me. 

Since then, nothing has been good for me. I’ve had to withdraw from the semester because I’ve been too depressed to go to any classes. My relationships are falling apart because I’m not acting like myself anymore and no one wants to be around me. Or maybe I just want to be alone, I don’t know. I don’t sleep at night because I don’t feel safe in my own bed after what happened. And I feel like there’s no one I can talk to about anything because they’re all sick of hearing about it. Even the people I know I can trust aren’t options. If I told my mom or dad, they’d make me move back home, and that would just make things so much worse. My closest friends would try to push me to get hospitalized, which my family can’t afford. I stopped seeing my therapist because I felt like whenever I tried to open up emotionally, she would change the subject. I don’t know what to do or who to talk to anymore. 

I’ve wanted to kill myself before, and I’ve actually had several suicide attempts. Something about this time feels different. I know what I would do, and I’m not sure if I’m more afraid that it would actually work this time, or afraid of the slight possibility I could still survive. I know I don’t want to die, really, and that I just want the pain to stop. But there’s nothing I can do that makes anything feel easier anymore and I don’t know if I have the energy to keep trying.

Broke my 2 year sobriety/suicidal thoughts.,"Today I'm having a drink for the first time in almost 2 years. 

I'm just at a point where I just don't want to feel anymore. I don't have a job because my depression is crippling. It's been 6 months since I left my last job which I was there for 3 years until it got to the point where I couldn't take it anymore. I've been trying to keep busy by doing home renovations but I can't even get out of bed past 1pm, even when I go to bed early. I know I need to see someone but I can't even make an appointment.

Hurting and I deserve it,People say bad decisions don't always make someone a bad person. I really feel like that isn't true in my case. I imagine myself feeling eternally shitty and a waste of a life. The hurt I have caused my SO has made me feel like I have no true identity. I wish I didn't have BPD. I wish I could have been better. I can wish and wish but that will never fix things. My body and mind feel useless I can distract myself with friends but I feel so distant from the world. I am filled with guilt. The worst part is knowing my SO has forgiven me and I can't help but think they may not want to be with me for much longer. I would crumble and disappear without him. I am filled with so much pain... pain that I deserve to feel. I wish I could disappear but thinking about dying is horrifying. If the world goes on just the same without me. If I fade into a distant memory to those who I know. I know I need more external help. But no amount of therapy will rid me of the thoughts I have about myself. I fear I will never grow from this.

"It's not the depression, it's me","I mean yes never feeling happiness, always feeling tired, and all that other shit that comes with depression would've contributed to this, but I think I'm just using depression as an excuse to hide the fact that I'm a terrible person.

I've had depression since at least the age of 10. I'm 17 now and until about a year or two ago my depression was never a huge problem. I was passing school, I had friends and I had hobbies. But one day after my suicide attempt I got a random boost in motivation, and I felt happiness for the first time in years. Feeling happiness only made me realize how miserable I am all the time, which led to me figuring out that I have depression.

Ever since I became aware of this, I started doing things like, failing school, ghosting friends, and dropping out of hobbies. Whenever I smile or laugh, I hide it and try my best to make myself sad. I fetishized my sadness, sadness was my happy place, and being happy was painful for me. I feel like I'm just putting on a play for myself to hide the fact that I'm just a selfish ass, who does nothing but play videogames all day. Now here's a good confession, I don't have a suicide attempt, yeah when the the day came I was to lazy to get out of bed and walk to the railway so I just didn't. Yet everyone I've told my story to has heard me talk about my suicide attempt, I told myself this so much that I actually forgot I never even tried for a while, but it's all a lie, just an excuse to make me look more broken then I already am. Some days I think of actually going there, and reenacting that moment to see if I'll actually do it or not, but I'm to lazy to get out of bed so as if I'd do that.

I fear that my therapist will find out. That if I get cured from my depression that I'm still going to be just as shitty as always and that it was just me all along. If that's true then that means there's no curing me, and that I'm just going to be like this forever.",Souless_F0X,1,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/fd5mg3/its_not_the_depression_its_me/,mean yes never feeling happiness always feeling tired shit come depression would contributed think using depression excuse hide fact terrible person depression since least age 10 17 year two ago depression wa never huge problem wa passing school friend hobby one day suicide attempt got random boost motivation felt happiness first time year feeling happiness made realize miserable time led figuring depression ever since became aware started thing like failing school ghosting friend dropping hobby whenever smile laugh hide try best make sad fetishized sadness sadness wa happy place happy wa painful feel like putting play hide fact selfish doe nothing play videogames day good confession suicide attempt yeah day came wa lazy get bed walk railway yet everyone told story ha heard talk suicide attempt told much actually forgot never even tried lie excuse make look broken already day think actually going reenacting moment see actually lazy get bed fear therapist find get cured depression still going shitty always wa along true mean curing going like forever,depression,u le f 0 x,1944,32,u le f 0 x mean yes never feeling happiness always feeling tired shit come depression would contributed think using depression excuse hide fact terrible person depression since least age 10 17 year two ago depression wa never huge problem wa passing school friend hobby one day suicide attempt got random boost motivation felt happiness first time year feeling happiness made realize miserable time led figuring depression ever since became aware started thing like failing school ghosting friend dropping hobby whenever smile laugh hide try best make sad fetishized sadness sadness wa happy place happy wa painful feel like putting play hide fact selfish doe nothing play videogames day good confession suicide attempt yeah day came wa lazy get bed walk railway yet everyone told story ha heard talk suicide attempt told much actually forgot never even tried lie excuse make look broken already day think actually going reenacting moment see actually lazy get bed fear therapist find get cured depression still going shitty always wa along true mean curing going like forever depression

I'm nothing, worthless, and nobody. If I die nothing would happen... The world around me would still be the same...

People die every day, so what would make it different if I disappear? NOTHING! I decided to hang myself in the bathroom.

I cried with pain and satisfaction that I will be leaving this earth then the shower curtain rod in my bathroom broke...

It was a loud thud but luckily everyone's asleep... I proceeded to cry in silence and thinking about what should I do?

2-16-2020,"on the morning of February 16 2020 i took my cat to the emergency vet to have her checked out. she was extremely skinny and was not moving and hadnt eaten or used the bathroom in 2 days. she barely wanted to be around anyone and her muscules were so weak she couldnt even use her back legs or stand. she would just drag herself to where she wanted to go then lay down exhausted. i thought she was going to die the night before but miraculously she survived but was still extremely weak and exhausted looking.

i put her in her pet cage and drove to the emergency vet. the vet examined her and immediately became accusatory and critical of me and how my kitty got into the position that she was in, asking me every question under the sun what did i give her to eat? whats her past medical history? and maybe about 40 other questions.  even calling my cat a train wreck. she was in horrible condition and he kept telling me things such as ""well if you wouldve taken her to your regular vet and had checkups sooner, all of this couldve been prevented"" ""you should've given her her medicine. hyperthyroidism is manageable and bc you didnt do this and that your cat is in the condition that shes in""   which just made me feel so damn guilty. i wanted to take her away right then and there. he then tells me that he couldnt feel her liver and that she only had 25% of her kidneys working and that she was extremely dehydrated.

he mentioned giving her medicine and iv drips and changing her diet but because of the state she was in, he said it wouldn't do much at all at this point because her kidneys would eventually fail. so then he suggests euthanasia. and my heart dropped like a rock. i didnt want to do it. i wanted to give her the medicine i was hell bent on it. ill pay it now, i dont care what the price is ill pay it now! but he kept pushing me and my sister to sign up for a credit plan to pay for it because he simply ""didnt want to be the bank"" he even said that we could give her all of the medicine and change her diet etc and theres a possibility that it still wont work at all because of how debilitated she was. 

eventually our family made the decision to have her put to sleep on the same day as the visit. we had a previous cat who passed away due to kidney failure and we didnt want her to go through the same thing. we all snuggled her, kissed her and pet her until she breathed her final breath on the table. it was heart wrenching. we didnt want to bring her home because we all live with out 80 year old grandmother who prior to having her put to sleep, my grandmother would see her dragging her legs and see how weak and exhausted she looked and would start crying and saying how she didnt want to see the cat suffer like that anymore.  we didnt want to bring her home because we didnt want anything to happen to grandma so  we had everything done in one day and it all happened so fast. im still torn about it. i feel like i can go back in time and pull her away from the table, and bring her to present day. 

i miss you so much misty,  my little baby. it felt like we all yanked you out of this world too soon and thats what drives me crazy. the regular vet i tookher to long ago when we first found out about it told us all that she had hyperthyroidism. all 3 of us were in charge of making sure she got her medicine until she finished it, and then it dwindled down to just me having the responsibility. i was in a very stressed out mindset between my shit job with no set hours,  and  taking care of my grandmother who has dementia.we have to make sure she dosent wander outside or anything. and had completely forgotten/ was counting on other family members to give her her medicine because i was not home. i had forgotten that she even took  medicine at all because she was doing so well. she was eating, and playing until about last year when i went to have her ears checked. thats when they reminded me. and it all went downhill. 

so again i gave her her medicine and she  finished it. only to find out this year she would have to be put to sleep. i never intended to hurt you misty, i never wanted you to get so sick. every morning i cry my eyes out wishing you were here with me on my bed or licking my hand or even meowing that cute little ""hello"" meow you used to do. every day i think about the what ifs and the if onlys. i cant even smell or look at certain things anymore, i cant smile or be happy anymore without my baby. 
i bought a box cutter last week because i was seriously contemplating ending my own life because of the horrible guilt. i feel like i murdered that cat. i feel like i purposefully let her get sick and die . i felt like she didnt need to be euthanized. it was my responsibility to make sure you got your medicine and i fucked up so bad. i dont want to live anymore feeling like this. im so sorry my sweet baby kitty.   how can i help my grandmother if i failed to help you? i feel like im the only one in the world dealing with this situation. i  know im not, but i just want to fucking die. i hate existing. everyday i wake up im reminded that my cat is gone. my best friend, my baby is dead and i caused it and i want to throw up. i hate living i want to die and just not feel anything im so sorry

It's over and there is just nowhere else to go.,"I think this could be it. I'm really just not able to grasp this world. This is not where I want to be. 

People are just so fucked. It doesn't matter where they come from, what they do, or even really how they act. There is just an insufferable defect in humanity's existence. I am 100% for an extinction event. I'm no longer in a panic about climate change or anything like that, I want it to accelerate. I don't want to be here when shit hits the fan, but I want it to happen. I am now certain that we are incapable of a better future where these defects do not exist. The same story keeps playing out over and over again, the only difference is now it is playing out on smart phones. People are just fucked. 

People call me a failure and I laugh. The tragedy is that there is no glory in this world. You could win a million bucks in the stock market and you are still going down with the rest of us. We see the way that the most powerful people in the world act every day. Some idiot decided to give them all Twitter accounts. Oh my gosh, what a riot. It has got to the point where the weak are still the weak and the strong just look dumber than everyone else. 

Obviously this is not the kind of attitude that anyone would want to put up with so I should leave to avoid pissing anyone else off even though I am absolutely right. I like to tell myself that having a better attitude means accepting a wrong position for the sake of getting along with everyone else walking off the cliff. Well there are two options, I can be right and go crazy stranded alone outside the herd or I can be wrong and feel good about myself because I have people walking into the abyss with me. What a stupid, stupid fate. Well there is a third option, I could kill myself. 

I don't even want to hear some people have it worse. I'm sorry but hearing about 6 billion people who have it worse doesn't brighten my day. Try harder, try again. You're not going to make me feel any better by reminding me my country, my tax dollars contribute significantly to their peril by bombing many of those people into ruins for the sake of politicians and bureaucrats who have literally become Twitter trolls. It's not funny, I mean it. 

I want to kill myself. I have had it in my mind for a long time but there was something spiritually holding me here. I wonder if that has passed. I don't see anymore goal posts. I'm begging desperately for a sign because as much as I want it to stop I'm a coward who fears death. But the pressure comes sometimes so hard, so intense that I'm not thinking about fear or any of that. Those are the moments where I know it might happen. 

This post may get deleted for inciting activism but for me personally I do not care what you do or what your social positions are. We are all collectively collapsing, so I don't care who you vote for or what you believe. These are just the thoughts driving me toward alienation and inevitably perhaps death. I'm not even looking forward to a girlfriend anymore. I can only imagine waking up every day and telling her we are all doomed, or better yet lying to her face and saying everything is alright.

Advice on finally maybe starting to get help,"Hi everyone,

For the first time EVER I am going to speak to someone tomorrow about my suicidal ideation, which has plagued me for 10 years. 

I'm currently at uni, and booked an appointment with a student support officer from my school. She's not a counsellor, but can deal with academic issues (which I'm having because of the big sad), and refer students onto mental health services.

I'm absolutely shit scared. I've never really spoken to anyone about how I feel, only a couple of times drunkenly to a few friends (who've never brought it up again). I just feel like it's time because things have gotten worse recently, and I'll be graduating this summer which is terrifying. 

I'm not really sure where to start with the meeting, or about what I should say? I've never met her before, I just emailed to book a meeting.

Let me know if this is the wrong sub. I'm basically just wanting to know how to start the conversation and how much detail to go into. It feels way too intense to just sit down and be like hi nice to meet you I think about killing myself every day and have a pile of suicide notes on my desk. I also don't want to be sectioned lol.",throwaway_sad_2020,6,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/fd51kc/advice_on_finally_maybe_starting_to_get_help/,hi everyone first time ever going speak someone tomorrow suicidal ideation ha plagued 10 year currently uni booked appointment student support officer school counsellor deal academic issue big sad refer student onto mental health service absolutely shit scared never really spoken anyone feel couple time drunkenly friend never brought feel like time thing gotten worse recently graduating summer terrifying really sure start meeting say never met emailed book meeting let know wrong sub basically wanting know start conversation much detail go feel way intense sit like hi nice meet think killing every day pile suicide note desk also want sectioned lol,advice finally maybe starting get help,throwaway sad 2020,1157,44,throwaway sad 2020 hi everyone first time ever going speak someone tomorrow suicidal ideation ha plagued 10 year currently uni booked appointment student support officer school counsellor deal academic issue big sad refer student onto mental health service absolutely shit scared never really spoken anyone feel couple time drunkenly friend never brought feel like time thing gotten worse recently graduating summer terrifying really sure start meeting say never met emailed book meeting let know wrong sub basically wanting know start conversation much detail go feel way intense sit like hi nice meet think killing every day pile suicide note desk also want sectioned lol advice finally maybe starting get help

I have no one to turn to.,"My father passed away last year. I feel incredibly alone now, he was my go-to person whenever I had a problem. I left my job to take some time off after he passed. I've left two more jobs since then, I just can't handle any of it any more. My gf, who I've been staying with, wants me to leave so she can ""find herself.""

I can't blame her really.

My father's gf, whom he was with at the time of his passing and for the previous 15 years or so, has already moved on and started dating a guy that I don't think dad would approve of, either.

I don't know who to turn to or what to do. I have a little bit of money saved up so I'm not in immediate danger, and I think I've worked it out with my gf to stay here until I find a job? I just don't hold out a ton of hope. Whenever I think of getting another job, most likely in a field I hate anyway (recruiting), I just think ""what's the point?"" Like I really don't have a ton to live for at this juncture. 

I don't want it to be this way and I just can't seem to figure a way out of it that would give me a good quality of life. It all just feels pointless.

I've tried to look up free or low cost therapists in the area, I have a couple numbers but trying to read about state funded mental health care and I couldn't make heads or tails of the webpage.

"Just got diagnosed borderline, and trying on new meds, I need help","My first post ever on reddit. Im feeling so low right now, been crying all night, and I just want to get better, but nothing seems to work. During Christmas vacation, I realised my partner had been cheating on me, the night I founded out, he went to that girl house and had intercourse with her. He still came back to my place after and told me everything the next day. I completely lost it, It was the first time someone cheated on me. I felt betrayed, and couldnt wrap my head around it. My reaction was to drink as much alcool, smoke cigarette until I could forget what happen.. unfortunately that wasnt enough I was still feeling so much pain. I than decides to take a half empty bottle of xanax with a bottle of antidepressant. Just to wash the pain away, just like that I was doing my first suicide attempt.  20 minutes after I realised what I had done and called emergency, an ambulance came over and I spent 24 hours at psychiatry aisle. I started seeing a psychiatrist after that, and was diagnosed for borderline personality. For me it makes sense, but it seems close friend and family think its too much, that Im not borderline.. thing is Im really good at hiding my true self. Ive been boulimic for years without anyone ever knew I was. Ive been having intense rage and impulsive reaction when Im in love. 

Anyway.. lets come back to my story, I ended up staying with my partner, a decision that has been torturing me ever since. There is not a day that passes without me thinking he would so ut again. I will think about what happened imagining it until I start feeling sick, and than everything turns black again. I havent been easy with him after that, but how could I ? 

My psychiatrist just prescribed me a new drug to mix with my antidepressants and I started them yesterday, I hate all the side effect if taking a new drugs and I just feel like I want to give up. ive been having a lot of fights with my partner in the last days cause I dont find him supportive. I feel so alone right now, I tried to communicate with him but its just too much, I feel like a burden for him and its been breaking me even more.

There is so much in life that I wanted, like I always wanted to have a kid, but I feel so unlovable... I feel like my mental health is taking too much place, I need help.

Am I the only one who doesn’t really care if I’m sent to the psych ward because I told my therapist too much?,"I don’t really want to die, I want to stop being so fucked up. And if the best way to do that is to kill myself, that’s the route I’ll take. But that isn’t the only route available, and if there’s a way for that to happen through medication or mental healthcare I’ll gladly choose that. But the problem is I don’t really care if I live or die, so if that course of action is too difficult I’ll just take the easy way out and kill myself (I say easy because it’ll be easy for me, but the main thing that’s preventing me from doing it is how other people will take it).

That being said, I’m not going to avoid saying something to my therapist because I think he’ll send me to a psych ward. The best chance I have to get better through meds and therapy is to be honest with what’s going on, and I’m completely fine with that. I don’t really have anything going on in my life I wouldn’t mind sacrificing a week for. Hell, I’m well prepared to sacrifice my own life in order to stop the pain. I’ve been to a psych ward before, and it’s kind of nice since it’s a way to kind of die a temporary death and be away from everything else in my life. It’s not as good as death though, since I’ll still be fucked up in the head and as long as I’m fucked up I’ll suffer, but it’s better than suffering and still having to do shit.

Anywho, if the psychiatry route doesn’t work I can always kill myself, but it seems stupid not to take advantage of psychiatry to the fullest while I can, and that means telling my therapist enough where I could be hospitalized.",weakbrainedwaste,0,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/fd5wyz/am_i_the_only_one_who_doesnt_really_care_if_im/,really want die want stop fucked best way kill route take route available way happen medication mental healthcare gladly choose problem really care live die course action difficult take easy way kill say easy easy main thing preventing people take said going avoid saying something therapist think send psych ward best chance get better med therapy honest going completely fine really anything going life mind sacrificing week hell well prepared sacrifice life order stop pain psych ward kind nice since way kind die temporary death away everything else life good death though since still fucked head long fucked suffer better suffering still shit anywho psychiatry route work always kill seems stupid take advantage psychiatry fullest mean telling therapist enough could hospitalized,one really care sent psych ward told therapist much,weak brained waste,1547,109,weak brained waste really want die want stop fucked best way kill route take route available way happen medication mental healthcare gladly choose problem really care live die course action difficult take easy way kill say easy easy main thing preventing people take said going avoid saying something therapist think send psych ward best chance get better med therapy honest going completely fine really anything going life mind sacrificing week hell well prepared sacrifice life order stop pain psych ward kind nice since way kind die temporary death away everything else life good death though since still fucked head long fucked suffer better suffering still shit anywho psychiatry route work always kill seems stupid take advantage psychiatry fullest mean telling therapist enough could hospitalized one really care sent psych ward told therapist much
Terrible Suicide Case?,"  I am a weak and small person that know one respects.  I am treated like shit and abandon by society.  I am aggressive to people.  I think about murdering and killing others.  I take out rage on myself and pretend to slaughter the people that constantly disrespect and hurt me.  I like the grey sky that gives the depressing tone.  I like gore and violence and doing things that I find somewhat happiness towards but I fall into this void of grief and sorrow.  I am a hopeless one.  I am loading the bullet and not caring for what anyone thinks.  I don't care for life anymore.  I am accepting my fate.  I am glad that I am choosing to kill myself because it gives my a mature understanding of the cold and brutal reality of the human race.  I don't go to counselors or therapists. I like being this way.  Cold and sad makes me feel happy.  I have lost interest in friends, activities and prefer to be alone.  I am a sad and pathetic human being and wanted to say goodbye to the ones I cared about which is practically 0.  I am a loser that hangs myself with a guitar string and is bullied daily.

Now think of how many of all suffering people don't even seek for help because nobody gives a fuck, that's the human nature. It's just that it hurts. Even if someone ""wants to help you"" it's just because he or she will feel as a better person and then will leave you like a trash that you are so why even bother looking for help? Maybe depression is just a name created by people who are too scared of what reality is like.

I am a Christian a real one and I ask God at times to take this from me and it helps but it’s like a voice a little guy on my shoulder waiting and watching and anything can trigger it. UHG! So frustrating. I think about how my dog, my husband, my brother sister and nieces and nephews need me but the voice doesn’t care. I was just wondering if there is a part in the brain that does this? I have never done hard core drugs but my mother was high on speed when she was pregnant with me... and she has a dopamine issue because of all the drugs and falls into deep depressions or gets suicidal from it.

I've been planning for years.,"Over the course of my life, I have attempted suicide four times. Each time, I was hospitalized, and each time I've tried again. The last times, it failed because someone found and stopped me. My ex boyfriend commit suicide last year. I have difficulty making plans due to a mild obsessive compulsive disorder, and just finding time. 
I have a heart condition that has been steadily worsening after a miscarriage, and due to it, I can't hold down a regular job and have since resorted to online work that pays like shit. I'm homeless. I have only two people in any sort of position to provide support, emotionally. And even though it's looking like the most difficult parts of life are ending and getting better for me, I don't honestly believe a life with all these new restrictions is worth it. 
My family is going on vacation soon. I wasn't invited. That week, I can complete the steps the way I planned, if I want to. Now the question is if I even have the physical strength for one last shot at it. 
Who knows? 
It might fail again. But I have no doubt I'll keep trying. It's the only thing I haven't given up on.
Meditation and such seems to point me in this direction. Tarot readings, horoscopes, all of it seems to be dropping hints that this is it. The main difference between all the times before, is that this time, I have nothing left to be afraid of.

Should I visit a psychiatrist?,"M/16, currently going through depression and can't talk to anyone. I've been visiting a psychotherapist for about 2 years and a psychiatrist for several weeks but just decided to stop going there like 6 months ago. I've been diagnosed with social anxiety and have depression but never actually talked about that with anyone, not even with my parents or the therapists. My everyday life goes like this: wake up, survive 7 hours at school, come home, play video games for rest of the day since I don't have anything better to do, cry into sleep, repeat. In school I barely speak to anyone even though I am going in the same class for over 5 years now. Only have 1-2 friends but they mostly only see me as the last choice everytime and only want to meet up when no one else has time. Recently we got someone new in the class and it seems like he had more social contact with the everyone else in the past 3 days than me in the last 5 years. Everyone think's i am introverted and it's kinda true, but only because I get rejected by everyone I even try to talk to and get excluded from everything. When people throw parties, I never get invited but people they barely talk to get invited. My grades are horrible and I am about to get off the school and don't even know what I want to become, since i just stopped caring after I noticed that everyone ignores me and no matter how hard I try to build up a new friendship / contact, I get rejected. I am the kind of person to look at my phone and than ask someone what time it is just so I have somewhat of a social interaction lmao. My parents only see my grades but don't care about my feelings. Because of this happening over many years (basically my whole life) I began to hide behind a emotionless mask. I am not able to express my feelings. nothing. The only thing i can do is laugh (because of something funny, not because i am actually happy) or hate on something. Even if anyone would make me happy, e.g. inviting me to a party, I couldn't show it and still act bored / emotionless because I am too afraid what people would think when I suddenly change and behave like everyone else. I also don't know anymore how to feel empathy. Like i would really like to and empathize with someone but no matter how hard I try it just doesn't work. When someone is sad I can say to myself ""this person is sad"" and feel bad about it, but I cannot comprehend it. I also feel absolutely worthless. For example I don't even say hi/goodbye to most people since i think i am not worth their time. When I meet someone from school outside accidentally, I walk pass them and they walk past me just because I don't want the other person to feel awkward. I know they don't like me and their day is probably ruined just by seeing me so i don't try to force the contact. At this point in my life i noticed that people are just assholes not caring about anyone. Everyone has their perfect life and ignores me so trying further wouldn't change anything. I honestly don't know what to do anymore. In the past i began to think more often about how it would be if just killed myself. I am not really thinking about doing it, but honestly I couldn't care less if I just got hit by a but. I feel like visiting the psychiatrist / therapist wouldn't change anything since I am not being honest to them anyways and don't know how I could be. Anyone good experiences with psychiatrist? Did it help in your case?

Life is unbearable. I'm losing my mind. I wish I had the courage to end this shit. Praying that someone out there reads this.,"I've been realizing some damn hard truths about myself. I've never been happy, ever since I was a little kid I felt like I was ""bad"". You know how children play ""house"" and it can be used in therapy to evaluate their outlook and issues? When I was a kid, I would play ""house"" with my fingers: there was the mom, dad, brother, and sister (me, the pinky finger). Each time, everyone would gang up on and beat up the sister. I just remembered that I used to ""play"" that game the other day - I don't think I have any real excuse for that, I was anxious as hell from a young age and irritable as fuck, but what kind of kid thinks of that shit? I was messed up back then.


I've talked to professionals. They seem to think that this is more than anxiety and depression. They say that I've faced a lot of trauma in my life. I suppose it makes sense. My parents were heavily abused during their childhoods, my mom even tried to kill herself as a young kid. My dad was an abusive alcoholic for most of my childhood. He and my mom would fight a lot - they would swear at each other, he would hit and throw things at her, she would scream at him and they would usually tell each other to go to Hell or drop dead. My dad was verbally abusive, and I remember he would hit my brother too. I presume he hit me, but I don't remember. All I remember is that when I was a teenager, he got so angry at me that he held me down on the couch. I was so detached, all I thought was how he was so angry he was about to drool on me, and how it was gross. I love my parents, despite their flaws. I just don't like them. We fight all the time. When I was younger, I remember that often when I got into a row with one parent, the other would get involved and then they would fight with each other. They would say horrible things like what I said above. They would say awful things to me too, like how once I was mad and my mom said I should look in the mirror to see how ugly I look. She would tell me to ""get out of her sight"" a lot. I get called a bitch at times. I'm told I treat them horrible, and I hate myself even more when they say that. Ugh. On the note of trauma, I realized earlier this year that I was repeatedly raped (oral, not vaginal) by my ex over the course of a year or so. That's also been tough to process.

It's fucked because I know my parents love me. They read to me as a child, they taught me to be independent. They just want me to be happy. But there's just always been something missing, I guess.

I realized that I may be in a chronic state of mild dissociation. I often feel detached from my body, my emotions, my environment, other people. I feel like I'm in a fog. My limbs aren't quite attached to my body, I feel floaty or dizzy. Weak and shaky. At times I dissociate harder, and I go totally numb. Can't move. Can't talk. Things look smaller, I float above or behind my body. My vision gets weird. It's scary yet comfortable because I'm aware that I'm further detached from myself and in a limbo for an hour. It fades and I get a headache, my body hurts, and I'm exhausted. Then it's back to reality, and I feel even more off for the rest of the day. I've noticed I also mildly dissociate when I try to sleep. My head is disconnected from my body, my limbs feel large or disconnect from my body. It's incredibly disturbing and I don't know why it happens. I never even realized I apparently dissociate until I started thinking about my childhood. Experienced some crazy depersonalization and derealization. When it happened, I realized that it was *very* familiar and I remembered doing it a lot as a kid. That realization fucked me up.


What really makes me feel crazy is the apparent somatic symptoms. I developed chronic visual snow and headaches as a teenager. I also started getting ocular migraines. Numerous tests and exams showed that all is well - it's just stress. My mouth has been hurting for the past year, as well. I even got an extra wisdom tooth removed, thinking that was the source of the pain. Nope. The pain persists, and is very noticeable when I'm stressed. Xrays and exams show that things are fine. I feel like a damn hypochondriac or like I'm malingering...but this is all very real to me.


I feel weak a lot. I am also dizzy, or like my brain is rotting, or stuffed with cotton/fog. My head is never ""clear"". I can't focus on much. Working is difficult. I can't truly interact with friends or family anymore. My weight has been all over. Due to horrible anxiety, I had lost a third of my body weight in 9 months. When I fell into this double depression, I lost 14 pounds in 2 weeks. Then someone I care about confronted me about the seriousness of it all. I tried to maintain my weight, and it worked for a month. Then I had a little breakdown and lost 7 pounds in 5 days. Started an antidepressant and became apathetic as hell - had an aborted suicide attempt and binge ate like crazy even though I wasn't hungry. I was like ""fuck it I deserve to gain weight and look disgusting"". I've gained 10 pounds in a week. I hate myself so much.


The more I realize, the more I hate myself. I've tried six or seven antidepressants, I've tried therapy a few times and am trying again. On another med right now. It all feels so damn hopeless. I've wanted to die since I was 13, and every day is just full of more pain and despair. 


People tell me not to give up on myself, but it gets more and more tempting as time goes on. Ever since I was 15, I always had a strong feeling I would die by suicide. I figured I wouldn't kill myself until I was 27 or 28, but things are becoming more disasterous. I just wish I had the courage to end this suffering soon. I feel like such a disgusting coward and a fraud. I'm ashamed to exist, to take up space in this world.",shouganai_,10,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/fcq1c9/life_is_unbearable_im_losing_my_mind_i_wish_i_had/,realizing damn hard

Going through a bad episode. Holding on by a thread. One little thing could push me over the edge.,"My bedroom and bathroom look like a hurricane struck them and I can’t even eat normally, if at all. I can barely move. That’s not an exaggeration, just doing simple tasks feels like agony. I haven’t self-harmed in almost a year, yet I feel like relapsing. I just want to give myself alcohol poisoning or jump off of a bridge over an interstate. I feel like a burden on my fiancé. I know he loves me and that he’s concerned but he has his own problems and I’m only adding to his. I don’t recognize myself anymore. I don’t know who the fuck I am. I dread the future. Watching my boomer parents suffer from addiction, depression and loneliness and struggle to afford retirement doesn’t give me high hopes. I despise the fucking world. I want no part of any of this cruel, selfish, violent, disgusting place. I don’t have the energy to partake in this rat race just to survive.

I'm invisible,"Granted I'm known by many acquaintances but have zero friends. I am often repeating myself because so called friends don't listen or dont hear me or frankly, don't give a shit. I've been suffering from bipolar disorder, manic depression, for upwards of 18 years. I told myseld if I could just make it past 27 yrs things would get better. I've been hospitalized, most recently in September 2019, the staff basically said they don't treat us but just monitor us until we are stable on meds and fit to leave. I have no family, raised in the foster care system and I'm completely alone. I don't see the point in living anymore if I'm constantly in mental agony or being ignored or used on every level. I've taken care of people I thought were friends because I have so much love to give but misguided as usual I end up used and thrown out like a tissue or ignored blatantly. I can't keep a job so my stability is often rocked by my own uncontrollable emotions and outbursts and I can't cope anymore. I'm losing hope and honestly just would like someone to acknowledge that I am alive and a sensitive but real person. Even then I don't know how to curb the feelings and thoughts of suicide. My closest friends growing up have all passed, either by suicide or excessive drug use I'm honestly debating the same path because without them I'm more alone than ever. 
Idk if reddit is the place for this but at the very least I'm getting this out and have one outlet to speak on my real feelings.

Im extremely lonely.,"I have no real life friends, I sometimes talk to people during school about mutual subjects but never get called up after school or on the weekends. I have decent grades and I live comfortably but no one likes me. I try to be approachable I try to be nice it’s always the “shut up I didn’t ask” or “go away, no one wants you here,” I’m going to a therapist this Friday but I’m tired of living in a constant state of loneliness and isolation. I’ve begun to slit my area of my arm from my shoulder to the elbow. I don’t want people to see or know that I’m in pain. Everyday I go to school with a smile on my face. I come home and cry. No one likes me. I have nothing. I am worthless.

Coming to terms that maybe I just want to end it all and be done with it.,"I’ve had suicidal thoughts for a very long time. I’ve seen my GP, been put on meds, I’ve been to counselling you name it I’ve tried. But apart of me just feels like I’ve had enough and the only option is just to end my life. Sounds dramatic and selfish but if I’m honest I just feel like I have nobody there for me anymore and I’m just disappointing people around me like my parents for example, I know deep down that I’m just a failure in their eyes and all I’m doing is prolonging more upset for them as I’ve made there lives difficult in certain aspects with my depression and constantly making them worry. But I also feel as tho if I end it then there wouldn’t be that worry I’d then be gone. if I speak to my friends about it they’ll just turn around and say man up or stop being soft. Which has now just caused me to believe that I don’t have anyone there close to me to talk to, feel like Cant rely on anyone anymore and I just would be better off dead. Me and my ex split 6 months ago a short term relationship but that was one thing I felt really happy about and that ended because of how I am, just sad and perhaps not all there, or perhaps I’m just not capable in being in a relationship as there’s just clearly something wrong with me. I don’t see myself moving on from her to another as it shattered me deeply and I just can’t seem to want to get back out there, I just don’t believe I’m that type of person for anyone like she was at the time. Many things I could add to the list like I’m mid 20s I only have a part time job and I don’t feel motivated or want to look for a career because I just don’t feel I’m good enough anymore. Feels as though I’m really done with life and that my times is up and I don’t really know what to do anymore. I’m just sad and existing in a world that I don’t want to be apart of anymore and I’m typing this really because I don’t know who else to talk to about it anymore. I just want to crawl in a ball and cry every day and I wake up and go to sleep thinking I want to be dead. I just wish I could be happy again and be myself but it just doesn’t feel an option anymore..",martmaria8517,0,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/fd4al9/coming_to_terms_that_maybe_i_just_want_to_end_it/,suicidal thought long time seen gp put med counselling name tried apart feel like enough option end life sound dramatic selfish honest feel like nobody anymore disappointing people around like parent example know deep failure eye prolonging upset made life difficult certain aspect depression constantly making worry also feel tho end worry gone speak friend turn around say man stop soft ha caused believe anyone close talk feel like cant rely anyone anymore would better dead ex split 6 month ago short term relationship wa one thing felt really happy ended sad perhaps perhaps capable relationship clearly something wrong see moving another shattered deeply seem want get back believe type person anyone like wa time many thing could add list like mid 20 part time job feel motivated want look career feel good enough anymore feel though really done life time really know anymore sad existing world want apart anymore typing really know else talk anymore want crawl ball cry every day wake go sleep thinking want dead wish could happy feel option anymore,coming term maybe want end done,mart maria 8517,2120,73,mart maria 8517 suicidal thought long time seen gp put med counselling name tried apart feel like enough option end life sound dramatic selfish honest feel like nobody anymore disappointing people around like parent example know deep failure eye prolonging upset made life difficult certain aspect depression constantly making worry also feel tho end worry gone speak friend turn around say man stop soft ha caused believe anyone close talk feel like cant rely anyone anymore would better dead ex split 6 month ago short term relationship wa one thing felt really happy ended sad perhaps perhaps capable relationship clearly something wrong see moving another shattered deeply seem want get back believe type person anyone like wa time many thing could add list like mid 20 part time job feel motivated want look career feel good enough anymore feel though really done life time really know anymore sad existing world want apart anymore typing really know else talk anymore want crawl ball cry every day wake go sleep thinking want dead wish could happy feel option anymore coming term maybe want end done
A story to hopefully bring you back from the brink of suicide...,"Hi there, I don’t know if this will help you at all, but if it helps even one person, that’s enough for me. A bit of back ground information, I am a 22 year old that has been suffering from severe depression for the past year, with suicidal thoughts everyday of every hour. I felt like I was already dead cause no one seemed to notice me and I was slowly wasting away from the inside out. I also began to hear voices that would constantly berate me and tell me to kill myself, and after this, I sought help from my GP and was put onto anti-depressants (Sertraline) which did absolutely nothing. They didn’t make it worse, but they certainly didn’t make it better.

I was then put onto another anti-depressant (Mirtazapine) which I started taking at the beginning of February 2020, which seemed to help. I had the energy to finally get out of bed, take a shower and leave the house. But a couple of weeks ago, I noticed that although I had the energy to get up and go about my daily life, I was still thinking about killing myself everyday, but this time it was different as I had the energy and motivation to actually come up with a detailed plan and go through with it; and this scared me so much as I have never felt an urge to kill myself as much as I have in the last couple of weeks. 

So yesterday, I had a lot to deal with. My partner has been very sick with an unknown illness for nearly a year, so his parents rushed him to hospital. I was an absolute mess as I have been really struggling to 
silence the suicidal thoughts, whilst also fulfilling my duty as a carer for my partner. I had a mental breakdown after they took him to the hospital as the voices wouldn’t stop. I actually began shouting back at them, but after a few minutes sobbing on the bathroom floor, I became completely numb and decided to follow through with my plan. 

I grabbed my supplies, which involved a dog lead, but I had made sure to buy this one especially for this occasion as it perfectly fit around my neck and had a sturdy metal clip which I could attach to the banister which would hold my weight. I was ready to do it, I was ready to go, and I put the collar around my neck and began to push my neck down into the collar to cut off the blood supply to the main artery in my neck, I heard this would only take a minute or so to make me unconscious, and the whole time I was holding my dog close to my chest cause I was so scared, but I wanted to die so badly. As I could feel myself going, I stopped. And I don’t know what stopped me, but part of me thought that it wasn’t my time to go. So I ended up picking up the phone and calling someone, who managed to calm me down and helped me look at everything from a different perspective. 

I know a lot of people will say that it’s selfish for feeling suicidal or committing suicide due to the hurt it would cause to family/friends etc but from what I felt yesterday, none of that mattered. I truly believed that I wanted to die, and if I hadn’t have stopped myself when I had, I would probably be dead now. 

But this morning, my partner finally got an official diagnosis of what has been making him so ill. I am currently sat in the hospital waiting for him to come out of surgery, and I have been told by the doctors that he is going to live a very healthy, normal life after this operation. If I had have killed myself yesterday afternoon, I would never have gotten to find out that my partner was going to be okay. I would never get to marry him in April. I would never get to see him healthy and happy again. All of these things I would have never known if I was dead now. I can now look forward to being able to spend time with my partner who can now start to enjoy his life again, and I can try and enjoy mine as much as I can knowing that he will be around for a long time. 

What I’m trying to get at after my long ass story, is that if there is any sort of hope you can cling onto, whether thats a friend, a pet, something you’ve got planned in the near future, or even just the feeling of the sun on your skin. Anything to get you through each day. You never have know when your life could take a turn for the best, or if something amazing will happen; and all of these things you will never get to experience if you end it all now. I’m not here to say that you shouldn’t do it, because at the end of the day, I’m just some stranger on the internet that you don’t know. But what I do know is that things can always get better. Always. But you never know when; and you’ll never know if you’re not here.",RedandBlue912,14,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/fcuzx0/a_story_to_hopefully_bring_you_back_from_the/,hi know help

I dont want to die. I dont want to keep breathing.,"I use to drink often, I stopped. I'm very intoxicated so I might be all over. Shit happens right. 

I've been depressed for so fucking long it hurts to think about. At 13, 16, 19 everyone says it'll get better. I'm 23 and nothing's gotten any better.

I had a 3 year relationship and she threw me to the curb. I had a 2 year relationship following (after a break from  the 1st, we only dated a year but were close/fuck buddies for a year leading to it) and we broke up tonight, fun fact we still live together until july. My depression doesn't stem from relationships, there's a plethora of things contributing to it. I think I'm out of my depth on this one. We were fuck buddies because I didn't want another relationship. I didn't want to give someone a chance to hurt me again. 

She was moving for school and I couldn't bare the thought of losing her so I asked her to date and we planned and did move in together.
I've punched myself in the face because it's less damaging then cutting myself. I think at this point if I self harm it'll be the end. I promised myself that long ago though I didn't follow through the last time I started cutting myself. This time I think I would, one  pump of adrenaline is all it would take then I wouldn't be hurt anymore. 

I left all my friends for her, I moved an hour away for her. I dont see a point in living, I dont see a point in eating or sleeping. 

I dont know what I'm expecting fro. This honestly, I have noone but my sister and I hate being a burden on her (though tonight she may have kept me here). I know how I'd do it, it would be a 10 minute trip to get what I need. I dont want to but I have nothing and noone. No friends, out.of my family only my nana and sister talk to me. I've texted my dad yesterday and today about a car issue and that's the most we've talked in 2 days than I can remember. Usually it's around 1 a month, sometimes more sometimes less.

I'm a burden on everyone. I think the world would be a better place. All I can think about is putting a knife against my throat and givin' er. 

Relationships didn't cause this, certainly attributed. No friends, no family, noone to hurt if I die. I dont know what I was hoping to accomplish with this post but I think its pushed me farther towards doing it.

I hope you have a good day, thanks for taking a few minutes to read my messy/suicidal thoughts.

Maintaining Relationships with People,"Hello!

First of all, I really appreciate that you are taking the time to read my post and whether you were able to provide me with advice or not, thank you!

I feel like in order to give a better understanding of my situation, I need to talk about what I've gone through (I'm sorry that it end being a very long post)

When I was a kid, I was pretty much normal and had my group of friends but I used to be very shy and faced a lot of verbal abuse at that time but kept quite and thought it was a normal and ok thing, it didn't affect me though very much because of that. However in middle school, I've experienced trauma that changed me forever and left a very deep scar on me emotionally that took me years to overcome because no one tried to help, those who see me went through it and those who I spoke to about it didn't try to help. For years I had trust issues and was paranoid most of the time, it was my first experience of feeling alone and that no one understands me, and slowly I started to drift away and shut myself out, I just wanted to be alone and because of that I started to lose friends but I didn't care at that time, I thought I was doing the right thing by avoiding as much social interaction as possible. I guess in a way I was trying to protect myself.

The years after that, I've tried to regain my social life back and make friends again, I tried everything that I can from trying to act as a happy and funny person cause no one wants to see the real me, my depressing and sad self who wants to make friends with such a person? and when it actually works out, I thought I was doing the right thing but it ends up making me more depressed cause it takes me a lot of effort to be ""that person"" and I really didn't felt like I'm making any deep connection with anyone so I was like screw it, I'll just be myself by which I mean that I will not try anything to be forcefully liked by others and I thought since I'm into so many things, I will probably find someone who is into one of these things and be friends with but that didn't work out either. I kinda became that extra friend in a group that her existence or not didn't make any difference or that friend who you come to when your other friends are not around or that person you hang out not because you enjoy their company but you just don't want to be sitting alone. That messed me up in my senior year of high school, I felt like shit and I spent most of the time during the break in the toilet cause I rather that than feeling like shit when I am with others. And just to be clear, they are not awful people and they didn't say anything bad to me, it's just I've been friends with them for so long and whether at that time when I was trying to be the funny and happy person or myself, either way, I never felt I belong or that anyone cared, I felt I was just someone they knew and sure why not they can call a ""friend"".

In college though is where my struggle peaked, all those friendships that I made in high school are slowly disappearing everyone was moving on with their lives and I guess that means leaving unwanted relationships behind but regardless I did what I thought was right and did my part. I've reached out to them but it always ends up a one-sided relationship with everyone apparently and no one will reach out to me if I don't so I stopped. There was this one person I was close to during my school years and I tried to be the friend she can rely on in time of needs and depend on, I wanted to be always there for her but she never makes time for me but somehow she can with others so I tried to put ""our friendship"" to the test and just respond coldly to her messages just to see if she will ask what's wrong, I want her to notice that there was a problem and see if she gonna care about our friendship but she ends up unfollowing me in social media and blocked me out of her life that simply even though she perfectly knows me too well and knows that this is not my kind of behavior.

I had no problem talking with strangers, I can open a conversation and interact with anyone easily so trying to get to know people in college was not difficult except I don't think anyone wanted to be my friend, I just remain their classmate. I end up making just one friend in college, we had a lot in common and I really believed it could work out but it took a lot of ignoring of her frustrating attitude which sometimes makes me wonder if she will bother to hold on to me if I ever show my frustration. At some point, I've gone through a deep depression that made me very suicidal and thought there was no future for me but I was trying to hold on to hope and as much I want to act tough and act like I can handle this I couldn't, I really just need someone to talk to and so far as you can see I had no one except this college friend and I didn't know how it will go but thought let's give it a try so I opened up to her and after when I was done, the conversation didn't last for 2 minutes and I was so crushed because sure maybe she was not the perfect person to open up to but at that time I didn't have any option and I just really needed someone in my life to talk to. I really thought I'm gonna do it on that day cause I really lost hope.

As of now, it feels like I'm back at the starting point. I probably sound very awfully pathetic person or stupid to you. Every time when I'm not able to maintain any relationship in my life, I asked myself what's wrong with me? what have I done wrong in my life? I realized after a while that I try to fix things so hard in my life that I end up breaking it or damaging it but I always thought I was doing the right thing and doing my part by reaching out or helping out but somehow it doesn't make things better. It always seems that I'm the one making the effort and if you didn't notice, throughout those stages of my life that I mentioned no one tried to be my friend or wanted to but I've always seemed to be the one who wants to be someone's friend. Right now, I'm very much confused about what exactly I'm supposed to do. I just don't understand why I'm struggling so much to find somewhere I belong, I feel very much rejected no matter what I do. If I make an effort or not I end up alone either way. Everyone in my life seems to give up on me and no one bothers to hold on to me. I just don't know if I'm supposed to give up and just accept the fact that maybe this is how things supposed to be in my life.

I tried not to bore you guys with the details and complicate stuff, I hope my situation was made clear and it wasn't confusing. I just really need some advice cause I don't think I'm going to find a good one from my mind.

Is suicide worth it?,"Hi, I'm 15 years old. Currently been pulled out of school,due to many reasons, which is why I'm here so that I can clear my mind of any other thoughts that may lead me to things that I might regret later on. I'd like to share first my story so that no one would come at me.(ex. You're just 15, its just a phase. Pls stop doing this to get attention.etc) when I was very young I didn't really paid any attention whenever my father and mother would fought or when my sister( the 2nd oldest) would always ignore or would get pissed at me, because I thought that it was the norm. But things got worse when the whole family fought because of the sh*tty things my father had done and it all started because of me drinking a godd*mn cola, it went like this: ""who drank the cola?"" My father asked I was very scared so I didn't replied he asked that again and again until my mother told my father off, until they just started to shout at each other which forced my eldest sister to butt in, and the whole thing went to what my father did, such as adultery and abuse. So it lead to my father pushing my mother, which pushed my sisters to fight my father, physically. I couldn't do anything but it really shocked me, and blamed myself for it. After the whole ordeal, it took 5 months to mend back the family. I thought finally, but I still had other problemsto face. I know that its stereotypical of me to say this but my asian parents(filipino) would always forced me to study when I never wanted any of this, I just wanted to play with other kids with no care in the world but I couldn't. My mothers way of teaching really left a toll on me cuz she would just hit me whenever I get the wrong answer or if I couldn't reply with the correct answer. I've always been the 2nd honor roll, but when she said this to me on the way back home ""pls don't drop your grades it would be really embarassing to my friends if you did"" that was jusy painful for me. others may think that I'm overreacting it was still really painful, tho I still couldn't speak my mind, I continued still, I was getting bullied as well for no reason. Years went by I was already in my first year of highschool in a prestige academy. I made friends, been respected, and I had little bumps in my grades but I still felt really great. Then one day one of my friends who is a guy told me to hang out with him, I couldn't tell that he had malicious intents. I was just really stupid. He cornered me ""can i touch your boobs?"" He said, I was shocked and refused but he was really strong and managed to touched me and resorted to attempted rape, afte I broke free, crying and running in the same day. I couldn't tell anyone nor my parent. So I just cried the whole night and proceeded to go to school and bearing to be with him in the same class. I had finally mustered up the courage to tell the guidance councelor, and due to that he got expelled and words got out because of the things he did and so I got harassed even more with the guys but I couldn't do anything and told myself to bear with it. I now entered my 2nd year of highschool which started the changes with me I became more irritated, a hot mess. I've been disrespectful to my mom, the reason we fight every morning. And another problem rosed up. A mistress of my father contacted me, I knew that she was just messing with me but I felt so angry. So I told my guidance counselor because I didn't know what to do anymore, so she told my mom and filed a case to my dads mistress, but the case got dropped because they said the account iwas fake when clearly it wasn't, I know I'm no professional but it was pretty obvious that it wasn't fake. I got even more mad because my mom didn't mind and told me it must be  Gods plan (I'm christian but I'm not really on how my mother believes)now things really went downhill for me.I couldn't eat, I couldn't think of happy thoughts, I  would just think of nothing, or everything is just useless even humanity, and that I wished I could just sleep and die from it. Things got even worse because my sister(the 2nd eldest), whenever I tell her shes wrong she would get mad at me,whenever I got mad at her she would get made at me, even tho she was in the wrong, but she was too prideful and wouldn't say sorry but I still did anyway. When things got even more hectic I started to hurt myself, my mom knew and told me angrily that I did it because of the internet. I couldn't take it anymore everything that I do is wrong,  its like I'm the misfortune. I wanted to kill myself, which is why I went to the guidance counselor, and told my mom everything, so she pulled me out of school, and appointed me to a psychiatrist but the medicines was too much for me, in short it was painful, and it makes me go insane for some reason, and even messed with my diet(made me eat more). So my mom stopped me from drinking the pills, but the withdrawal was sh*tty too. I still get mad at everything and I really want to kill myself. I mean I don't know I'm still thinking of the pros and cons of me killing myself. Its just that I wish in my sleep someone would kill me. But I really wanna know if suicide is worth a shot, because I regret everything and I'm desperate( this isn't the whole thing sthst happened but its getting long that

how r ppl this clueless,"Today I got brave enough to tell my mom I’m not okay and that I need to go to the hospital. I told her last year that I tried to die when she found my suicide notebook and saw my SH marks on my arm. I haven’t been going to school and she sees me cry almost everyday. But when I told her she said “what made you think like that” and “you can’t think like that”. I said we need to go to the hospital idk what’s going to happen tonight. She said why would I go to the hospital and for what reason, like she doesn’t know. I told her never mind and she just moved on like it was nothing. Like her daughter is nothing. 

I also told my dad today, but all he could ass was “why would u feel the NEED to think like that” and asked me a bunch of questions as if it’s my fault I’m depressed and want to die. 

My friends know that I go through depressive moods and the first time they cared but by now, they don’t even bother to check up on me. 

I’ve been trying to get better by myself but I can’t do it. I stopped SH but that doesn’t make the thought go away. I’m just so tired and alone.

I’ve had enough of suffering, I can’t bear to see it. I feel empathy so hard, because of the severe depressive episode I went through a few years ago. I can’t bear to imagine anyone experiencing that. It breaks my heart. I convinced myself not to die but I’ve never truly felt at peace, life for me is just exhausting attempts at constantly distracting myself from the depressive thoughts that I just can’t get rid off.

i dont even know what to title this,"i think i saw myself in the tub five times this whole day so far and its only 4pm. i care for the people around me very deeply and just the thought of them being devastated when i leave makes me even more depressed. i deal with all of this all by myself as everybody does. i feel bad because everyone eventually leaves me after realizing how difficult my situation is and how draining it can be to deal with it. i guess you can say i’m a big ass burden.

i’m not the best worker. i’m incredibly lazy. not because i choose to have fun, but because i don’t feel good enough. my motivation to do anything is at a 0. another factor of why is i never know what i want to do. my upbringing wasn’t great and i was always constantly thrown off course from the things i really wanted to do to cater to people who didn’t care to see me happy. now i’m kinda doing my own shit without being asked, but it took me almost a year to learn how to think for myself. all thanks to my current partner though.

i’m starting to lose hope though. although i do have people i care for, i’m afraid of telling them how i feel beyond just “i’m depressed.” i know it makes the people around me really sad and sometimes suicidal themselves. so i stay quiet of the actual extent of how bad it can be. and because of my job, its hard to make friends. i can’t even tell people about what i do. do you know how lonely it gets? having to bottle everything up but too afraid to tell people how its just eating me up slowly. i was doing well for a second with my job and then last week, i spent the whole time all burnt out, crying nonstop just by myself. i but because of my condition and how it’s affecting me, i’m losing the one person who was able to get me to be productive and ignore my feelings. people are gonna comment and say “don’t ignore your feelings,” but i’m tired of having it impede my progress. and i know if they leave, i’ll go back to how i was; not doing anything and just laying all curled up in a ball just waiting for death to come naturally.

now i feel like i should just end it to avoid all of this. i’m too much of a burden. i just want them to be happy.

I'm been drinking.,I been thinking about religion. Like if you believe their is a God. Well he or she since God created man and women. Well God is the only super hero. I started to believe in a God since DINOSAURS. Even I try to pray to a God to take me back to 1994. Even my life is going no where. I have a mental illness called schizophrenia where the brain cognitive is dysfunctional. Hallucinations and hearing voices that arent their. Which makes me think solipsism. But hell im no God when I believe a God. Since I didnt create clouds trees or even DINOSAURS. I admit mental illness has no path of success.

And I am fucking FED UP with people telling me it will get better,"It will get better for you, the person with more than a handful of friends worried for you and asking if you'll be okay, the person who actually has a significant other who you can always turn to, the person who has a community that accepts them and doesn't discriminate against them for their entire identity. The person who only has depression and not a literal learning disability that impacts how you interact with others, and they treat you horribly because of it. The person who's pretty or at least average looking but at least they don't have a disfigured face people avoid as soon as they see you.

If you're all of those. Or at least one. It'll always get better for you. And I am none of these!

So I don't want to hear ""life will get better"" because it fails to take account to the people who have nothing and who's been like this for years. That's me!! This is how it'll be for the rest of my life, no matter how hard I try to make it better nothing sticks. It always goes back to the status quo. Misery!

I want to genuinely kill myself after this incident. How will I ever recover.,"I know. This makes me sound like a HORRIBLE PERSON. I meant to send the text to my brother about my friend but I checked the sender (after I got all my aggression and sadness/anger/frustration out through text) and it turns out the recipient wasn’t my brother...it was my friend. I feel like my world is going to end. I quickly deleted it all as fast as I could, but she had still seen it all...or most of it, and that is enough. Me and this girl have been friend for my whole life. I am 16 and she is 17. As soon as I realized that I made a huge mistake, I started shaking frantically and my heart almost beat out of my chest. The more I look at this situation, the less my friend is in the wrong, and the more I am in the wrong. After this incident happened with me frantically typing away and sending horrible texts about her in front of her face, I couldn’t even say anything. I was mortified. I I sent the texts (it turned out she had already seen them at this point) and simply walked away. I didn’t know what to say. I seriously just took out all of my aggression on one of my best friends, over text, in front of her. And won’t get into what the texts said too much, but basically they were saying: “ she always thinks she’s better than me, and always makes me feel bad” and so forth. And guess what...I started the whole schpiel off by typing: “ *blank* is so annoying. I got so scared and angry at myself afterwards that I threw up in the bathroom and cut my wrist. I deserved it. I went home early , to filled with guilt and too ashamed to continue on throughout the day, and now here I lye, writing this on reddit in my bed, hoping someone could share some advice. Also, I already tried messaging her saying, : “I know you saw what I sent you...and I’m so sorry” and so forth. In these texts of me apologizing, I wrote how some of the things i said about her were true, and tht I was really sad latley and depressed(I never talk about things like this with her, EVER because I’ve seen how she handles those types of situations....she simply cuts people off if they are feeling suicidal or sad.

am I suicidal?,"hi. I'm not sure if this is one of those things where if you have to ask it then there is a definite answer, but I'm not sure if what I experience is truly suicidal thoughts.

when I don't feel sad I become very thankful and when I try to express to God thanks for what he has given me, I feel guilty for spending my time self harming or being self destructive. I feel I'll never be able to truly convey how thankful I am for what he's given me and I'm back to square one, just wishing I was never born so I wouldn't have these thoughts and emotions.

I don't really care about anything and many of my thoughts are just wishing I could disappear or wishing I was ""less"" in every possible way. I want to not be alive so I don't feel the emotions I feel. I do not often contemplate different ways to kill myself, it is moreso just wishing I wasn't born in the first place or hoping someday something else will happen to me that makes this decision for me.

the majority of my thoughts are wishing I was dead or never born, and even when I'm happy I just wish I could stop feeling and the answer to that to me is death. is the way I'm feeling considered suicidal?

21 gonna commit suicide at 30.,"21, M, in college. Homeless in college. I feel so sad, so mad, it's all really bad. I feel as if there's nothing to really do. I feel stressed all the time. The only thing that keeps me going is music. I sing and play guitar and write songs everyday and post a new album about every month. Currently learning how to mix and record music on my own.

i will never be me, not truly, nature saw to that, its a cruel thing what i am, to feel and associate with something im not even close to being, the pain of not being it, if i ever had a choise i would never feel this pain from it, but it never was my choise this pain of not being the woman i feel i am inside that burden came to me, i no longer know how or what i am, all i know is that im defective, thats how i see myself at least.

i`ll be sad to see it all gone, and i wish i had the strength to stay, but i no longer do, thats the complete truth

I don't want to expose people to my problems anymore,"I know we use the word ""burden"" a lot. I do it too. There's more to it than that. I have family members who have been affected by my problems.

Most people don't want me around. I'm not desirable in any way. I'm not exciting. What I have to offer other people, like kindness, love, compassion, are outdated concepts.

The man I want to spend my life with plans on committing suicide in a few months,"Objectively, I say I'm pro-choice, but I just can't be with him. I want him and need him here.

He's in a bad situation and I can't fix any of it. He's says he's ready to go. I know my feelings just put more stress on him, so I try to avoid talking about them as much as I'd like to. We're long distance so I can't even touch him. He's been pushing me away for awhile now and it hurts so much. 

I'm also struggling morally with allowing him to go through with it. 

I won't have anyone to lean on because you can't talk to people about allowing someone to suicide. I think my one friend who knows about the situation will think I'm a bad person for not getting the authorities involved.

I’m hesitant to post because I don’t think my thoughts/fears/etc are worthy of anyone’s time.,"Feel free to downvote me into oblivion or to just move on. 

I just can’t do it myself. I want to die. In fact, I can’t actually envision a future for myself. The way some people see themselves getting married, having a career they love, having children, etc., I just don’t see that for myself. Instead, I only see myself dead. Sadly, I don’t have the strength or fortitude to end my own life. I have a plan for ending it all, but I just don’t think I could actually follow through with it. 

I have a fear of commitment, and committing to that decision is something I just can’t do. Several times everyday, I daydream about someone walking up to me and killing me. If someone else did it for me, it would make things so much better. Ironically, this makes me want to self harm, but self harming itself has left me with scars that make me feel worse about myself which, in turn, makes me want to end my life or self harm more.

Tonight is the night and I hate myself for it,"I am in the worst situation I have ever been in as I am about to become homeless. I returned to the UK after living abroad 5 months ago and things seemed promising at first however things went downhill pretty quickly. Finding a job has been a nightmare - i have decent experience and have had a lot of interviews but everywhere either ghosts me or rejects me. I get rejected a lot because I ""dont show I want the job enough"" but years of BPD and depression mean I find it incredibly hard to show my emotions. One company rejected me for this reason after 4 rounds of interviews!

On top of that, I was with a gambling addict a few years ago who made my life hell and created all kinds of debt for me (signing up to websites with my details, getting loans out in my name). Completely my fault for sticking with him so long but he has left me with £12,000 approx worth of debt so of course I am being chased on those debts too. I am also not entitled to any benefits. 

So finally I have ran out of money and am 2 months behind on rent, I let my rental company know today and was pretty honest about my circumstances (I said it was because of redundancy as it's less embarrassing). We agreed I will move out this week, not that I was expecting any sympathy but the lady at the rental company was a dick. So now I am homeless - I am not pregnant or super young or super old or anything like that so the chances of me getting any help are pretty much zilch. 

I am leaving behind the most amazing boyfriend that I never thought I would find and that's why there is so much guilt. I think deep down I am leaving this message in the hope one day he sees it and knows there is nothing he could have done. I have tried talking to him about this but he thinks I am just having a BPD episode and am exaggerating. There is no way he can help anyway he certainly couldn't help me financially (nor would I expect him to!) and he lives in the same house so staying with him isn't an option. 

My main wish is that him and my friends will be OK eventually and will understand that I am in a much better place!",ctbpduk,2,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/fcxxst/tonight_is_the_night_and_i_hate_myself_for_it/,worst situation ever become homeless returned uk living abroad 5 month ago thing seemed promising first however thing went downhill pretty quickly finding job ha nightmare decent experience lot interview everywhere either ghost reject get rejected lot dont show want job enough year bpd depression mean find incredibly hard show emotion one company rejected reason 4 round interview top wa gambling addict year ago made life hell created kind debt signing website detail getting loan name completely fault sticking long ha left 12 000 approx worth debt course chased debt also entitled benefit finally ran money 2 month behind rent let rental company know today wa pretty honest circumstance said wa redundancy le embarrassing agreed move week wa expecting sympathy lady rental company wa dick homeless pregnant super young super old anything like chance getting help pretty much zilch leaving behind amazing boyfriend never thought would find much guilt think deep leaving message hope one day see know nothing could done tried talking think bpd episode exaggerating way help anyway certainly help financially would expect life house staying option main wish friend ok eventually understand much better place,tonight night hate,ct bpd uk,2094,45,ct bpd uk worst situation ever become homeless returned uk living abroad 5 month ago thing seemed promising first however thing went downhill pretty quickly finding job ha nightmare decent experience lot interview everywhere either ghost reject get rejected lot dont show want job enough year bpd depression mean find incredibly hard show emotion one company rejected reason 4 round interview top wa gambling addict year ago made life hell created kind debt signing website detail getting loan name completely fault sticking long ha left 12 000 approx worth debt course chased debt also entitled benefit finally ran money 2 month behind rent let rental company know today wa pretty honest circumstance said wa redundancy le embarrassing agreed move week wa expecting sympathy lady rental company wa dick homeless pregnant super young super old anything like chance getting help pretty much zilch leaving behind amazing boyfriend never thought would find much guilt think deep leaving message hope one day see know nothing could done tried talking think bpd episode exaggerating way help anyway certainly help financially would expect life house staying option main wish friend ok eventually understand much better place tonight night hate

you mean more than you know,"ive been clean from heroine for 2 weeks, and even since the unbearable pain of withdrawals have passed, the mental emptiness has not, and might not for a very long time. like many of you, i still think about ending my life every day. 

2 days ago, i was out on my porch, writing a suicide note. seemingly, getting the last rays of sunshine i would ever feel. I was content with that. Then, I heard my phone ringing. Who the hell is calling me on my last day here. 

My best friends twin sister had been diagnosed with Leukemia. Think about your BEST friend, and how their pain, is often yours, as well. I mean, why wasn't I already on my way to grab my car keys and see him and his family? 

After a few grief-stricken hours spent with them, I headed back home. Then, I realized; for a whole two hours, did I really just forget about fucking killing myself?

The one thing that took me out of my thoughts of death were simply thoughts about someone else. And it helped me realize why I ended things with heroine, and not with my life. 

I'm not one to know whether it is healthy or not to love someone more than you love yourself. All I know, is that a phone call from my best friend stopped me from killing myself. The circumstances of why he called me reminded me of the importance of me still being alive. Anyone who has experienced something like this, I encourage you to not see these instances as coincidences, but as testaments to the fact that you are meant to still be alive.

I don't really know how to wrap this up. I just hope you all know how much you really matter. Because now, I remember how much I matter. I know this won't help everybody, but I hope it will help somebody.

The only person who can make me better is myself and I can’t do that,"TLDR: only I can make myself happy again and I know for a fact I’ll never do that, I’m hopeless

———

I’m only making myself feel worse because I have so many things to do and I’m not doing any of them because I’m lazy and want to lie in bed all day. Then the stress of it all just builds up and the stress paralyzes me into inaction even more and then more stress piles up and so on

I’m digging myself a hole, I’m making myself worse off and ruining my own life

And at the end of the day it’s up to me to fix myself. It’s up to me to get things done and to get my life in order, to make myself happy again

But I know for a fact I can’t do that. I’m too lazy, too tired, can’t focus on anything or anyone other than myself. I’m pathetic 

I’ll never be able to find the will to fix myself so why am I even still here? Just to stay miserable until I inevitably kill myself down the road because I’m incapable of helping myself

Nothing will ever be able to fix me. It’s all up to me. It’s up to me and that’s scary because I’ll never be able to help myself. I can’t, I know for a fact I can’t and I won’t

Klonopon side effects ruining my life Im losing control...,"I have been a chronic sufferer of gad all my life. Thanks to klonopin my worries symptons anxieties were gone.

I'm constantly euphoric, spontaneous feeling of deep rage and an impulse to punch and scream. On top of that, being ticked off by little things and become explosive. 

If the price to pay to not feel worried all the time is explosive behaviour Id rather take the other. I have recurred to smoking to calm myself. Right now Im a step away of losing control over and really lose myself go in a blind beastly rage.

"I feel so lost and tired, so I'm writing it all out to make myself feel better a bit.","These days I just feel like running around in circles. I keep making the wrong decisions, all of which coming from my inability to control my emotions. I am currently facing the consequences of my decisions and of course, am very tired as I could not see any way for me to feel accomplished. Additionally, I have imposed problems upon others, including my loved ones. It all began so well. I was in this perfect mint condition of being an average student from a prestigious high school in my country. The school's full of brilliant kids I can't seem to catch up with, and once I feel exhausted to keep on competing with them academically for scholarships, I stopped trying. My mom was having a perfectly stable job, earning an equivalent of 500 USD each month. Yet, the toxic environmental conditions of the city we lived in back then made me feel really oppressed, not to mention I was absurdly overwhelmed by the isolated feeling the school gave me. 

That was when I decided to stupidly leave my country for another place that seemed more ideal - a country in Europe, with inarguably better climate (because I love cold weather), better food quality, generally peaceful urban life in contrast to the busy city ruled by crazy drivers. It felt great for the first few days of arrival and my head was temporarily free from all the pressure, but all magic comes with a price. 

Basic things in life such as water are ridiculously expensive here - it's stressful to think about it in the shower. Additionally, I've moved to a new school. What made me so reluctant about it was the fact that it's an international school: small but sweet community, but with tuition fees that have considerably stressed my mom out. The prices are equivalent of what my mother made in her old job in 2 years. Life was good until Coronavirus struck. Apparently, healthcare in Europe is downright FRUSTRATING. (sorry European friends) Few countries took the quarantine procedure seriously, and the country I'm living in now isn't one of them. I want to go back...

Days went by and I discovered that lots of kids in my old school are currently achieving something. Something that I once considered to be my dream, but had given up on it just because.....emotions. 

Ughh I don't know anymore... I'm so stressed atm I don't even know what I'm saying anymore.

I have cut a few slashes to my arm once, though not noticeable, and very much want to do the same again. I have so much to think about. I feel guilty for putting someone like my mom to go through things so I could get what I wanted.

I can't do it anymore.,"Hi.  I'd rather not say my name, but I'm 15 and I've been like this since I was 11.  I don't want to do anything anymore.  Everything just seems... boring.  I'm quite sick of everyday repetition.  Wake up, eat, go to school, come home, eat again, then sleep.  I've lost interest in all the games I thought were interesting before.  Now it's just as dull as a pencil that hasn't been sharpened in a couple years.  I don't want to do it anymore.  My grades are dropping like the downwards part of a roller coaster.  I hate everyone and everything.  I hate them because they are disgusting.  I hate them because they are annoying.  I hate them because they do nothing to help.  Everyone doesn't like me.  They only tolerate me.  They like to pick on me since I'm like this.  They think it's funny if someone is a failure.  Failures like me are disgraceful to everyone.  I can't do anything right.  I get yelled at by my mother for the smallest of things.  I have religious propaganda pushed on to me everyday and it doesn't stop.  I just need space.  I want to feel the same spark of interest I felt when I was a little kid.  Everyone thinks that I'm doing okay when they can clearly see that I'm internally suffering.  I don't want to live anymore.  Life was okay.  Life was great.  Hell, I'd even say that life was the best thing that happened to me.  But life just started going downhill and it's still going lower and lower than it was before.  If I killed myself all of my problems would go away.  Everyone couldn't bother me anymore.  Everything would be peaceful.  I'd all be okay.  I can't do it anymore.  Everything is too stressful to deal with.  I don't want to put up with this life anymore.  It already sucks enough as it is.  So why not just end it.  I guess I'll just finish the things I had planned first.  I just want things to be okay but they aren't going to be.  If anyone wants to help me go ahead.

Am I being a burden on my family?,"I'm 16 F diagnosed with depression. I'm thinking of killing myself tonight. Tried yesterday, failed. One of reason behind this is that I'm being burden on my family. I don't have mental capacity to think clearly. So I'm asking you. 

Dropped this year boards because I wasn't able to study at all. Its near beginning to next session, and I haven't recovered a bit. Because my parents this is happening because of some sort of supernatural evil thing. After diagnosis they didn't took me to therapy ever again. Rather they took me to get rid of that evil thing. I'm not gonna be able to to study and waste all their money again. They also have to give dowry for my marriage and pay for my education. And waste my life, and their money. We have financial problems too.

I think it's justified to commit suicide.

But what if ruin their mental health.

My mom had BPD, and schizophrenia. My sister is 10. I think this will ruin their life. But we aren't close emotionally. They might also be better without me.

My reality is mess, I think I can never recover, and waste my life, and live like this for 60 years, which is so scary. My mom doesn't go to a doctor because she thinks this is because of that evil thing. I'm scared for her. She doesn't eat because she thinks her enemy is gonna kill her if she does so. No matter how much we insist to take her to a doctor, she refused.

I'm stuck.

I'm scared of all the suffering there are in the world. I've seen street dogs die because of road accident, and there's no one to even take care of the dead body. His hide was there at the road. 

Please don't say not to commit suicide, just because of your moral obligation. Please answer if my family would be better without me.

As an adult, I've been physically and verbally abusive to my mom. I've left her with black eyes. And my stepdad. I've told them both to kill themselves a million times. I've said some truly awful things. Not just to them. I lost a friend after I verbally abused her, too. And I've treated my best friend horribly.

Worse than that, the animals. Both of the first cats I ever had ran away, so I must have done something to them. The third, I chased her around and sprayed her with water and hit her. For years. She was traumatized. She hated me. She'd always scratch me up and I deserved it. The fifth cat ran away, I don't know what I did. The sixth cat I don't remember if I was mean or nice but I gave her to some old ladies because we had to move. I hope they loved her. My seventh cat is my current cat. I got her right before I turned twelve. I used to put a laundry basket over her and shake it while she screamed. She was just a little kitten. I stopped doing that at some point because my mom talked to me. But I hit her. Sometimes multiple times. This cat isn't traumatized mostly. She cuddles me every fucking night that I let her. But...

Then there's my dogs. I beat the shit out of my older dog, multiple times when I was an older teen. I beat him with shoes because he chewed them. He was just sad I had to go to school and I beat him. My younger dog I beat the shit out of once (maybe, technically, twice? same day in a short time period), ever. 1,264 days ago. I was so gutted about how badly I hurt him-- he was bruised under his fur and upset for days-- I swore never to beat any animal ever again, and I haven't. But I still hit them. I'm ""extremely abusive"". That's how my grandma describes me. My fucking grandma. (The dogs aren't traumatized at all anymore, but...)

I also ripped off a lizard's tail...and killed a lizard...but those were accidents. 

On top of all that, it's quite possible I'm a pedophile. When I was 14, I chased an 11 year old girl around trying to kiss her. (I succeeded. This happened 2x.) And when I was 19, I read 2 fanfiction about a sexual relationship between a 16 year old and a 12 year old. And I had dreams for years about rape? Of children? I mean, I also have OCD and it could just be that. But one day I abruptly decided that That Wasn't Going To Happen Anymore, and now it happens much less. It's unpleasant. 

I don't want to be like this. I don't want to be abusive to anyone. I was never abused. I recently started therapy (again). I'm on medication (Paxil). I think about the abuse all the time. It's probably 80% of my thoughts. I am trying to not do these things. To never be verbally or physically abusive again. I love my family and my pets and they have never deserved this. But I will never be able to undo the things that I have done. Even if I try to make amends. Even if I'm forgiven, which I am. I am a bad person, and thanks to what I've done, I will always be.

I deserve every ounce of guilt I've felt these past 1,264 days that I've known I've abusive. These past years where I didn't try to change until now. I deserve to feel this way every miserable day for the rest of my life.

Everyone always brushes me off. Nobody listens to anything I say, I feel so alone. I’m not sure if I truly want to die or if I just want to hurt myself badly enough to be hospitalised for a few weeks. I’m scared to truly die, but is it strange to want to hurt myself and be hospitalised for a while? I want to take a break from my life and be somewhere with people who understand and will take care of me. I feel like the only way I’ll be able to escape is if I attempt suicide and am hospitalised, and they’ll finally have to take me seriously. Is this a crazy thought? Does anyone else feel this way?

Everything in my life has gone to shit but the only reasons I'm still here is my cats,"I'm 22. I grew up in an emotionally, verbally, and occasionally physically abusive home. My dad became an alcoholic as a result of the abuse from my mom. I became the unwilling referee and parental therapist as a preteen and eventual side punching bag as a teen. My mom has tried to kill me a few times now - some before I was 18, some after, and also kidnapped me as a child after she and my dad had a fight. I spent all of my adolescence waiting for a chance to get out. CPS came twice but nothing ever helped. I got into a dream school and everything as a senior, but that got ripped away too. Mom refused to sign off on loans - which I could not get without a co-signer. There went my escape. 

They divorced. I became the physical punching bag for my mom. I cut my hair off to prevent her from grabbing it. My dad got worse. I tried to kill myself a few times, all of which failed for some reason or another. Got 51/50'd. My mom proceeded to use that as a threat from then on of where she could send me if I didn't behave. I stayed with my dad after that, and cut her off. Still was depressed as fuck though. Only person I could talk to about any of it was my grandma. One night talked to her and my aunt (who's racist and hates me) happened to also be there. She took the phone and screamed at me. Told me never to call my grandma again, told me to stop making up shit about my family and stop talking suicide to an elder. My grandma could handle it, she used to feel that way too - it's why I could talk to her about it. 

Fast forward a little bit and my dad (just after we finally patched our relationship and things looked better) suddenly died from his drinking problem. I had to go back to my mom because no other relative was an option. My mom immediately took it out on me, and I became terrified to even wake up. She tried to smother me to death, tried to choke me out with an aux cord, tried to shove me down the stairs, tried to push me out of a moving vehicle, etc. Yet every time blamed me. It was the worst year of my life, or so I thought. At least I had my grandma. She was depressed too, over losing her son, and because she was being abused by her daughter (the racist aunt). I was trying to help but it always got covered up somehow. Then exactly one year later, my grandma suddenly died. But she left me half her estate to protect myself, because she wanted me to move out and live near her. She was the only person left that wanted to help me. 

But then my aunt (the one from before) got hissy about the fact that her mom and I were closer than they ever were, and she lawyered up. She refused to give me a key, refused to give me the items my grandma specifically wanted me to have (because no proof), and informed me of the sale well after it happened while I was out of state. She also kept going through my mom, which was idiotic - as my parents divorced and I was an adult. I asked her about it, she dodged, so I wrote a letter. She never contacted me again for months, so I had to get an attorney (that I can't afford tbh) and we've been back and forth on that since. Now she's threatening to file the taxes under my name without my permission without my SSN so the IRS comes after me. All this over fucking recipe cards and a desk!  

I always think about wanting to end it, end the pain, end the inevitable suffering that always comes, but I can't. I can't leave my cats. I refuse to rehome, the word itself hurts me to even type or see. How could I do such a thing to my family? The only ones there for me? Anytime I cry they sit on me and purr or lick my face and one of them legit meows at me until i talk to her and she keeps meowing till i'm done and then snuggles. They are literally the closest to me and the only ones that keep me going. I just wish I could do something for them too (like find a new place to live, but I can't). My mom recently made credit cards under my name and maxed them out. Told me this just so ""I'd understand the position I'm in."" If anyone asks her she says it's just to help me build my credit. To which I'm sure is somewhat true, because she intends to sign my name off as a cosigner to a property she wants to buy. 

To her I've only ever been a means to an end. I just want out, I don't want to die. I want a place on my own with my cats, safe and sound. But I feel like I'll never get out. And I'm afraid to wish too because everytime I do I get something

I'm pretty sure I'm just overreacting,"Hi everyone. I'm really not even in the mood to do this, but I don't want to be alone now. I'm having a breakdown and considering suicide. I think I'm overreacting to something, but I don't want to be judged right now. Can I ask that there be little to no judgement towards me please? I'm not in the right here, but I just want peace.

&amp;#x200B;

So today, my boss of a year told me she's relocating me. She said it's because of my body odor. She talked to me in January about it and I told her I'm doing my best. She told me today I was doing better but today it's been ""the worse it's been since then.""

I'm absolutely devastated. I have depression and schizophrenia, but I still brush my hair, brush my teeth, use deodorant, and body spray. I don't shower often because I have bad memories of when I was younger, I had severe eczema, and my skin would burn and peel when water touched it. I'm terrified of showers now. 

I know I have a responsibility to take care of myself, but it's so hard when I'm TRYING but no one seems to care that I'm trying. I also know my boss has been stressed lately, but I feel like she forgot what I told her in January and is snapping at me.

She also just sent me an email.

"" In January we had conversation about hygiene one that I had been reluctant to have.  From that conversation I believed that you would rectify the situation. Over the the past few weeks hygiene has become an issue again.

I am not sure if I am able to assist you in figuring out how to go about resolving the problem. What I am sure of is that you are a great member of the team and I want you to continue to work in the office.""

I'm not even sure I want to be here anymore. I was feeling really good about myself today. I changed clothes, used deodorant and body spray, and brushed my hair for the first time in days. I'm also getting my first car tomorrow. I thought that I could have a week where I actually felt hopeful.

I know I'm overreacting, but I just feel horrible about myself. I called my dad crying and he told me it was my fault and that he isn't trying to ""hurt me"". I told him ""I shouldn't have even called anyone."" and hung up. 

I'm just really tired and considering overdosing when I clock out of work today. I have plenty of Zoloft, plenty of BuSpar, and one dose of hydrocodone. I just regret being here because I have my dog here with me on campus. I asked my dad to come and pick me up and he acted like I was asking him to move a mountain for me. Even though I pay for gas and food and bills. So I told him to wait until tomorrow, I just wouldn't go to work tomorrow.

I just really want to die because I feel so awful about myself. I feel like I'm not worthy of love. I feel like I'm not worthy of respect. I'm exhausted. I feel that it would be better if I was dead, so my boss wouldn't have to deal with me.",Vincebae,1,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/fd1mrm/im_pretty_sure_im_just_overreacting/,hi everyone really even mood want alone breakdown considering suicide think overreacting something want judged right ask little judgement towards please right want peace amp x200b today bos year told relocating said body odor talked january told best told today wa better today worse since absolutely devastated depression schizophrenia still brush hair brush teeth use deodorant body spray shower often bad memory wa younger severe eczema skin would burn peel water touched terrified shower know responsibility take care hard trying one seems care trying also know bos ha stressed lately feel like forgot told january snapping also sent email january conversation hygiene one reluctant conversation believed would rectify situation past week hygiene ha become issue sure able assist figuring go resolving problem sure great member team want continue work office even sure want anymore wa feeling really good today changed clothes used deodorant body spray brushed hair first time day also getting first car tomorrow thought could week actually felt hopeful know overreacting feel horrible called dad cry told wa fault trying hurt told even called anyone hung really tired considering overdosing clock work today plenty zoloft plenty buspar one dose hydrocodone regret dog campus asked dad come pick acted like wa asking move mountain even though pay gas food bill told wait tomorrow go work tomorrow really want die feel awful feel like worthy love feel like worthy respect exhausted feel would better wa dead bos deal,pretty sure overreacting,vince bae,2851,37,vince bae hi everyone really even mood want alone breakdown considering suicide think overreacting something want judged right ask little judgement towards please right want peace amp x200b today bos year told relocating said body odor talked january told best told today wa better today worse since absolutely devastated depression schizophrenia still brush hair brush teeth use deodorant body spray shower often bad memory wa younger severe eczema skin would burn peel water touched terrified shower know responsibility take care hard trying one seems care trying also know bos ha stressed lately feel like forgot told january snapping also sent email january conversation hygiene one reluctant conversation believed would rectify situation past week hygiene ha become issue sure able assist figuring go resolving problem sure great member team want continue work office even sure want anymore wa feeling really good today changed clothes used deodorant body spray brushed hair first time day also getting first car tomorrow thought could week actually felt hopeful know overreacting feel horrible called dad cry told wa fault trying hurt told even called anyone hung really tired considering overdosing clock work today plenty zoloft plenty buspar one dose hydrocodone regret dog campus asked dad come pick acted like wa asking move mountain even though pay gas food bill told wait tomorrow go work tomorrow really want die feel awful feel like worthy love feel like worthy respect exhausted feel would better wa dead bos deal pretty sure overreacting

I always feel like killing myself on my birthday.,"Turning 31 on Friday. Every year since I was maybe 12 or 13 I have felt this way. Once in awhile I want to see friends, party, indulge. But that lasts for mere minutes. Then the doom and gloom sets in and all I think about is really sticking it to everyone and offing myself on my birthday. I feel like I only stay alive so no one's ""feelings get hurt""

Thats it,"So i failed my semester again for second time.
I always was the top grades on my class till i entered college and everything just fall .
Cant focus or study till i failed for first time in my life
And thats where i became depressed.
I was always that strange kid who dont think like a kid or play like them
I was just a smart kid who cant find a meaning for anything.
I wasnt sad but not that happy too .
Even when my dad died i felt nothing even so he tried to kill me twice but still did many good things to me .
I remember i only cried a little when i saw my sis crying really hard for him.
And then i became a depressed person after first year in college .
Going to uni was a hell for me
I just wanted to be alone and sleep forever.
Till recently i found the courage inside me to change my life 
I started nofap and started praying everyday and dieting .. deleted all video games and books or films i had.
Just to change my whole life and felt really good even so i had many faild attembs but tried to improve .
Now i got my grades and failed again..
I dont want to die now .. i finally found something i rly want to do. And want to improve my life
But unfortunally thats it for me
I know my mother gonna have like a heart attack if she saw my grades.. and me myself cant just live anymore.
I had enough of these empty feelings.
Its the 27th of this month
My last day.
Till then i will continue doing my ""life changing"" daily habbits and studying more than ever for last time to prove to myself i can do it like others before suiciding.

Parents don’t get it,"I’m 16 I’ve been severely suicidal since I was 10. When I was around 11 I slit my wrists and my parents walked in when I was bleeding out. They said they were ‘busy’ working and gave me antiseptic cream and bandaids instead of taking me to the hospital my dad walked in later that night and cried over me and basically called me selfish. No one ever talked about it again and I never received help. I’m now in 11th grade and school has never been worse I’ve already had 2 pretty serious breakdowns and I’m  only 6 weeks in. Through extensive online research I found some ‘painless’ suicide methods and purchased the drugs and blades necessary to pull it off. I almost did it the other night but I want to finalise some things first. My mum is gone so just now I went to my dad for a final plea for help and when I told him he said “it’s all in your head” “ the

school makes me feel suicidal. does anyone have the same experiences,"hi, id like some advice if that’s possible. i suffer from extreme anxiety due to environmental and emotional stressors. this makes it extremely difficult to physically sit down and complete schoolwork before the deadline. i also miss a lot of classes because i am scared of confrontation.

just yesterday i submitted a late essay assigned a few weeks back that was half assed and didn’t even meet the page number requirements. this just perpetuates the existing anxiety because now i have to face the teacher tomorrow morning and possibly be questioned about my quality of work. i have a 504 plan but the thought of asking for extensions or additional help makes me feel pathetic.

anxiety + depression + an untreated eating disorder has caused my grades to falter ever since the start of last year . i am a senior in high school and am deathly afraid of being deferred from the colleges that i have been accepted to. the fact that i can’t keep up with high school work suggests that ill fail at college too

i’ve started becoming suicidal due to this. body dysmorphia makes it difficult just to step outside of my house. i have no friends, i am lonely and comfort myself with food, which i usually throw up after. the only people willing to listen to me are adults who are paid to do so

i fear that other people view me as undisciplined and lazy, or just plain stupid. there is no evidence against these perspectives as i keep all of my mental struggles hidden. in reality i am investing all of my energy just to haul my ass out of bed in the morning and get through the day. my mom works long shifts to sustain me but i as her child have nothing to offer in return- no friends or partners to introduce her to, no academic success or improvement, etc. on top of that she has to schedule all of my psych and therapy appointments which is difficult for her as a parent. she’d be better off if i weren’t here to burden her. 

i have a bunch of upcoming psych appointments and have my fingers crossed to be prescribed medicine. maybe i’d sulk less on some zoloft? but i know this isn’t a way out at least not a permanent one.

What is stopping me?,"It is very frustrating to have the feeling of ""today shall be the day"" and have every single little detail planned out and yet, it is suddenly so hard to execute it. 

So many fucking times I have held the knife over my wrist, had ropes tied to the ceiling and I just couldn't do it. I am not afraid, nor sad. Just.... a walking dead. Though I attempted many times too, but always failed.

I'm not sure how many of you feel the same but I just can't do it maybe because I'm curious to find out if there will be a brand new ending.

I can't take myself anymore,"I don't really know what im expecting of righting this but at this point i'm willing to do anything to stop this unbearable pain of existing.

I'm gonna give you a brief overview over my entire life and what exactly it is right now that lead me to the decision that my life is not worth living anymore.

Elementary School was hell. Had a teacher that sat me behind a bookshelf from which i wasnt even able to see the blackboard or participate in class because i was ""distracing"" the other children. The teacher videotaped me ""misbehaving"" in class to ridicule my parents and parentsmeetings. I was a smart kid. I was able to write and do basic math before i went to school. I was bored. When i was finished with my stuff I walked through the room and helped the children that were struggling. I dont see any misbehaving in that but maybe im wrong. Final report card was straight A's. Teacher still recommended that i go to a school for idiots. In my country this recommendation is on the report card. When i applied at ""normal"" schools not a single one wanted to teach me because of that recommendation which was just straigh up bullshit. In the end i found a school that saw my potential and didnt care about the recommendation. So i was able to get a decent education.

While all of that was happening home was hell. My dad was violent and abusive and my mother never intervened when he punched me in the face etc. i dont know if she did not care or if she was afraid. it doesnt matter to me. I felt and still feel abandoned. 

From age 9-12 my older brother was raping me over and over. Not like once a  month or something. EVERY SINGLE DAY. sometimes even multiple times. But who should i have asked for help? my father that is violent me? my mother that doesnt do shit? He even invited his friends to watch and spit on me.

With 14 i had the realization that i wasnt normal anymore. I wasnt talking alot. I stopped enjoying literally anything. Thats also when i started to cut myself.

Fast forward to me being 19. I finished school. Got my highschool diploma eventhough i was suffering from severe depression as i found out later. I also had 1 friend. Lets call her L. I got a job over 100 miles away from my parents. I moved out. Lived there in terrible conditions since i made almost no money. But i think i felt better. Im not sure since i was stoned most of the time. After 3 years living away from my parents L tried to commit suicide. I blame myself but i dont want to get into detail of why that is. She survived. I was there for her. I took all my years vacation to be there for her. 

6 Months later i live with my parents again since i was breaking down and wasnt able to take care of myself anymore. i admit myself to a mental hospital because i was highly suicidal and L urged me to do it. After i admitted myself L blocked me on all social media up to this day. This was 3 years ago. I stayed 3 months in the hospital and learned alot. I learned that i suffer from depression, paranoia, narcissm, have borderline personality disorder and have symptoms that might be a psychosis but no one can confirm or deny this. I was talking about all the stuff that happened to me. But i learned nothing to cope with that stuff. Or accept it. Or stop thinking about it constantly. 

Basically i was worse than before. Everything was fresh in my mind. But no one taught me how to deal with that stuff. But hospital said i was ""healed"".

I moved out from my parents again and got a job in a callcenter since that was the only thing available in my hometown. I got minimum wage, had to have crazy amounts of knowledge, had extreme stats i had to reach or i was laid off and i hated every second. I was sick alot. Like ALOT. Every 2-3 weeks i had something. From colds, flu, migrane etc.

I stayed for a whole year. Eventho i was sick often i had exceptional stats. 99% customer satisfaction with extremely low talk time etc. Then i quit. I couldnt take it anymore. The constant pressure. Knowing that i will never be promoted no matter how good i am. Constant stuggle with money. I was miserable.

So i went into a different mental hospital. Did dialectic behavioural therapy instead of trauma therapy. Learned to use skills. Which is basically just finding something to occupy your brain so you stop thinking your sick sad thoughts. Does it solve anything? No, not at all. Do i feel better? No.

In therapy i found a girlfriend. She is perfect. She talks with me. She is understanding. But im struggling so hard since i have this paranoia that literally any person on this planet is just trying to hurt me. I trust her. I know that my thoughts are not real. But it hurts so fucking much. Just a few days ago she got her period. Almost 2 weeks earlier than expected. My thought process to this situation was. ""Well she was partying with her friends last weekend. She probably fucked a dude there, got Plan-B and one the side effects is that your period might come earlier or later than expected."" Like what the hell? How do you even come up with something like that? I feels like i just want to hurt myself. I should be happy. She is doing everything she can. And i cant appreciate it since my mind is just thinking up storys to hurt me. This literally makes me feel like im insane. Why would i do that to me?

Now im unemployed. Get my money from health insurance. Well for the next week that is. My psychiatrist told me that he wont be writing me sick any longer. He gave me no reason why he wont continue since he is 100% aware of my mental state. That means i dont get any money from my health insurance anymore since they think im healthy. Which means i have to get money from the state for being umemployed. Getting money from the state in my country means that you are required to apply for jobs. For ANY job that the state choses for you. If you dont apply (and show up to interviews or decline a job offer) they wont give you money. Like literally 0.

I cant work. I cant even apply for a job. Im not even able to keep my small flat clean or keep care of myself. 

I dont know what to do anymore.

Tonight I wanna end it all,"It all started 2 years ago when on my 15th birthday my friend gifted me a video game called CSGO and I though it was gonna be the best thing ever as I was new to gaming. Then I met a guy from the UK by the name Nukes on steam ( a gaming platform) and he was good friends with me for a year we used to play sometimes and chit chat about csgo trading and stuff. And then my next birthday I decided to buying a $100 steam wallet code with all my saving of past year + birthday money ( its a big deal for me as I dont have a job yet student nor rich) and Nukes told me his ideas and how it would be great if I could send it to him and he could get me profit from trading items in the game ( he was on steam for 3-4 years already) so like any innocent person I went with it. Then it started. Me finding out he lied to me and started blackmailing me, acting racist to me, forcing me to do stuff like shaving my eveybrows and calling his friend the n word on tape if I wanted my money back, I was naive and though if this is how I could get my money back it wont be a big deal. It went on from there, he moved on to asking my socials and always under the pretext one last thing you need to do, I was getting severely cyber bullied and abused day and night but didn't tell anyone and use to cry everyday at night. He even went on stalk my youtube channel make more false promises, message my real life friends when I tried to block him and lure me back. It has made me really sucidal over the last 2 years and now I can't live with this anymore.

Done fighting,"On mobile so if my formatting sucks, well that’s another thing I’ve failed at.

I’ve been fighting my whole life to survive. I was severely abused and neglected as a child. My childhood was a constant battle, being beaten, starved, mentally abused and broken down. 
As a teen I was sexually assaulted at 14 by step brother then my “best friend” at 15. Still being mentally abused by my mother. Which led to a suicide attempt at 16, I took a bottle of Xanax and oxy. Sadly, I was found woke up in the hospital having a tube being shoved down my throat and the taste of charcoal. Soon after I got in a relationship with a man who cut me off from my friends and family. Beat me and made to tell me how worthless I am on a daily basis. Got away at 18 almost 19. Which involved him stalking me and terrorizing me. Ive been struggling with a eating disorder that whole time. At 19 met my soon to be ex husband he was never abusive just clueless, everything I did was never good enough. Never validated my feelings. I had 5 children from 21-29. I left my husband at 30, got in a relationship with another man. Who ended up abusing me. He raped me, beat me, and mentally abused me. He also introduced me to drugs. Now I’ve been struggling with addiction, and an eating disorder. I left him 4 months in that was last year. Pressed charges, my soon to be ex husband has given me a place to stay because he needs the nanny. But his mom is moving in. And I’m going to be homeless, I know my kids deserve so much more than a mentally broken mother who is so withdrawn. So I gave custody freely to him. I am so tired of struggling with my thoughts. I have been fighting my whole life. I can’t anymore. 

I have a plan next week to get a hotel and make it look like a accidental overdose so my ex gets all the life insurance money. 

Btw this post can’t even be linked to me, I have two phones. My main one is the one everyone knows about. I use a vpm on this phone. So there’s no way they would know I posted this when I took my life.

I can't do anything right and I'm too scared to follow through with this but here's how I imagine it would be,"Burial By the Sea

I want the waves to sing me their lullaby 

I want my last sight to be blue

I want to wait five more minutes and see if dolphins guide me somewhere new

It'll be near the cliff side

It'll be near the shore

It'll be so that the sand covers my body to be seen nevermore

Perhaps inside of a tent

To disguise the sight from the tourists' naked eyes

Perhaps outside of the caves

To refrain from having my spirit be alone in the dark

Maybe I'll see stars

Maybe I'll see the moon 

But most likely it'll be when the sun sets after noon 

I think it'll be peaceful 

Not so much for those who find me

Quite a lot of suicidal thoughts lately....,"So this is getting straight out of fucking hand. I'm a young male, studying and I feel like whatever's this feeling (Anxiety? Depression? Stress? I have no fucking clue!) Is catching up with me. Now: supposedly I have a loving family, friends.... All that shit you already know. But I don't want to talk to them, not even my gf, in whom I'd trust almost anything. Grades are fucking reverse skyrocketing. I CAN'T get myself to sit down and study shit. I'm probably going to fail music, even although I have been taught music in a music school for about 7 years. I just don't understand some subjects and probably won't at all. Worst part is we are having a trip to Ireland before the summer break, and you are automatically chosen out if you fail 2 or more subjects. I will probably fail French, Music, Spanish, Math, and most likely Physics and chemistry. Now, of all of those I just used to struggle with math BTW.

So just recently I've started cutting myself again. Not serious wounds straight in the veins. But cuts in my left hand and arm which stay there for quite a while. I will most likely continue doing so as my grades keep coming in. I will most likely get any source of music taken away from me (PC, Mp3, Phone....) And this won't help at all with the situation. 

Also recently I started going out with a girl I liked since 2-3 years ago, and she has liked me for the same time. This is the first relationship for both of us. None of us has ever kissed, made out with anyone, etc. And we are both really shy. And I have had friends since the start of the relationship (We've been together for 3 months now) trying to pressure both of us into making out. I, as the coward I am, obviously couldn't make it happen despite her FUCKING TELLING ME SHE WANTS TO. 

And I've also had quite a high number of suicidal thoughts lately. Mostly think of how could I do it...
Think of hanging myself, OD to death, find a gun somewhere (not common at all in my country) and blow my head off, cut myself, tie a rope around my neck and stretch it so hard I die, sealing my swimming pool while turning on the water for it to slowly rise and drown me, put a toaster with me in the bath.... I'm quite creative, really....

Also I've been finding it hard to find reasons to stay alive.

Everything is falling apart,"I've already had a lot going on in my personal life, and I was closer to suicide than I'd ever been. Then there was a huge argument among my friends. I won't get into details, but I don't think they'll make up. I was right in the middle and now I need to fucking pick a side. But I don't want to pick a side. If I do I'll lose some of my friends, and I am neutral on the whole situation anyway. If I don't pick a side, I'll start spending more time with one group than the other because I hate changing things, and then they'll hate me. So I'm going to isolate. I won't sit with them in the morning or at lunch, I'll only work with them in class if they come to me, etc. If they want to talk to me they'll find me. I don't have any other friends, so I'll be completely alone. Of course, that'll only happen if I don't end up killing myself before the end of March break. I was so close to suicide before the argument, but now I'm pushed past my limit. I'll probably go for the next opportunity I get (i.e. know I'll be home alone for 2+ hours).

I can't stop hating myself,"So I'm supposed to graduate in December and I don't think it's going to happen. I have let myself slip because of health problems and no matter how much I study, I can't get past a B or C on exams. Even got a 23% on a test I took last week.

"I feel so hopeless at this point, I want to be encouraged to end my misery","I'm 49, single and still a virgin believe it or not.

Religion,  Neuroticism , introversion, possible aspergers etc. It is not a simple problem.

I'm a guy. Today is my bday.I bought a can of chlorinated brake cleaner and want to hit it with a welder. That is pretty much what they used in WWI to wipe out the trenches. You smell a fresh cut lawn and a day later you are in a great place. I don't care if I suffer a bit but it is a 100% kill rate. Every single day is suffering for me.

No, I'm not some 19 yo writing this. They have their whole life ahead of them.

Now, it is not like I went out without a fight. In the last few years I watched every self help video. Most were aimed at young guys probably.

I bought clothes.

I have cool hobbies. I work on cars. I fix houses. I like to cook.

I work out. I run and rollerblade - 25 miles is not a problem - I don't even get out of breath. I'm still skinny though and built almost like a teenager. I tried to build muscle but I can't. Men my age look ""substantial."" My neighbor is my age EASILY twice my size. I look at men and I see their wrists and bones, I'm built like a woman. There is something unfixably wrong with me.

I feel like I'm dead and invisible to women. People my age are married with kids and enjoying life. I die inside when I see couples. I missed out on so much in life.  No one even wishes me happy birthday. It is hard to understand what truly being alone is like. It is like death in a way.

I'll never have kids or a family at this point. I just don't want to be the creepy old single man.

I have a computer company and make mid 6 figures, but it brings me zero joy. I'm not trying to brag, and I know other people struggle financially and feel bad but would you want to sit ALONE in front of 4 monitors for 12 hrs a day to make this money? I don't hate the work but why do it if I have no one to share it with?? I feel so alone, like I'm working from hell. I guess people benefit from my work indirectly thru the taxes I pay and the welfare and SNAP they get.

I just need the courage to empty this can and light up the contents. I'll finally be at peace. There is nothing at this point that will make me get better.

Why is it so hard to be happy?,"I am in my 40's, fought high and low with my depression and thought that I was over it but in reality its never have gone away...  I am in my life once again living a lie. A lie that is to much for myself to move forward. I have a great family, nice new Home, Nice cars, new business and great career.  but nothing seems to make me happy any longer  and the more I think and want is to end my life...

Yes I know suicide is the  easy way out to a temporary problem.  But in my life today  its no longer temporary. It feels that I can no longer feel myself to be alive anymore...  This is not my 1st rodeo but I did try to end my life over 10 years ago and wish I never survived it but I did and I am here again today thinking that, the feelings I am feeling is  to much for one person to take on every day every second and mostly every breath I take...

There are days I want to end my life and finding a way to end it, but I am a POS for not following threw any of. When I go to bed i say a prayer...   I now go to sleep, my lord my soul for you to keep,  as I don't need to wake in the morning so please take my life and let me rest in peace in my sleep, praise to you my lord my savoir, take my life , take my soul and take away the pain i am living as the pain to live is to much for me to take everyday to wear a fake smile.

Every day I drive my vehicle to the office  and thinking  what pole, what bridge, what wall or Truck  I can drive into, or what building  I can jump from so that I can never feel this pain that I feel

I now know why the funnest man alive as in Robin Williams end his life as now I want to do the same,,

I think I’m reaching my final moments,Best part about the winter is that the water is so cold here. I’ve thought about jumping in and never coming back. I’ve thought about this probably at least once a day since it got cold out. It’s a spot where other people have disappeared. Maybe if I take a bunch of Xanax or something that will help mess me up so much that I die easier. I’ve written suicide notes before but I go back and read them and think they sound stupid so this time I’ll keep it brief. 32 years I tried. I held on for my mom and brother but I don’t have any fight left in me. I’m tired. I just want to rest forever. I’m sorry to everyone but you will all be fine in the grand scheme of things.

I just want to be done,"I’m a 21 year old and my birthday is in two week’s (st.Patrick’s day), my entire life has been rough. From the moment I was born I had heart issue’s and growing up I had a growth deficiency, to then my ribs growing in words and crushing my lung’s along with asthma. That’s just a small portion but it sums it up. From losing my dad at 15 when I finally was at an age to do thing’s he liked which I developed a love for because I got to hangout with him, to then never being able to do them again and having to retire from hockey and sports because my lungs are so small due to my chest issues. Everyone left, I had nobody when I lost my dad, I spent years silent, didn’t talk to anyone, same racial expression everyday. I dragged myself out of the hole, then life continues and people keep coming and going and destroying me on the way out with friends betraying me and relationships being cheated on. I’ve never been good enough for anyone. My mother doesn’t speak to me anymore, she’ll go through my siblings to contact me. She also moved across the usa. Finally I’ve hit a point where I just don’t want to keep praying for better day‘s. It’s been 6 years of in and out of hospitals for mental issues and thing’s just never get better. I then lost my best friends dad from cancer whose family took me in when I was on the brink of ending it all and they helped me get better and it worked until my previous relationship. I mean I was happy again. Like I felt normal. I wasn’t crying every morning and every night. I was excited for the day. But it’s been about 9 months since that and I’ve cut the world off and I haven’t spoke to anyone in week’s bc nobody ever tried to contact me and it was always me reaching out so I stop tried. I have no confidence left and I have no chill anymore, I’m just the guy that’s there with his headphones in always. I’m tired. I can’t seem to do anything right. I just want to be at peace, I don’t want to be here but I can’t do that to my siblings. Even tho we don’t get along well I don’t want them to enter a depressed state like I’ve gone through for years. I’m just running out of energy and idk how much longer I can do it until I just say fuck it and be done and end it, end my pain. Nobody seem’s to care about my pain so idk why I should care about anyone else’s anymore. I’ve always been the person who will help anyone even if I barely know them.

So sick of being so lonely,"I just don't know how to be normal anymore. The littlest things can set me off. I'm always hurting peoples feelings with jokes I make, then I always say ""Don't be so sensitive"" when I know for sure it was MY fault they got offended. It's hard for me to take responsibility.

I also feel very alone, and I don't mean the sense of friendships. I'm talking about romantic relationships. I've had about 4 or 5 concussions, and I say that because I know I've definitely had some that weren't diagnosed as I used to box. It's just really hard for me to say what I want to say. I fumble my words a lot, and I noticed that after my most recent concussion about a month ago.

For example, one thing I said that I regret was calling a girl a ""dyke"" because she said something rude to me. What I said was so uncalled for, especially since I knew she was bisexual. I feel like trash because I don't say things like this (homophobic) all the time per-say, but that is just an example of how offensive and unregulated the stuff that comes out of my mouth on the daily.

I constantly have to be high on marijuana most of the time to keep my mood up and I don't want to be like that. The weed just makes things worse for me when I'm not high because I get even more irritable then I was before I smoked and I go through bad anxiety and psychosis episodes.

I also feel like a failure. I am in my senior year of high school and I feel hopeless. My grades are all F's and I don't know what to do anymore. I plan on going to trade school after this year but I probably won't follow through on that because I never follow through on anything I want to do,  as my anxiety prevents me from doing lots of stuff.

I think about suicide but the thought scares me and it's just and endless cycle of just that and it sends me down a dark hole in my thoughts. I feel hopeless like nothing can help me anymore.

Also, I don't want to sound pathetic but its what I am. I told the girl I like that I liked her. She said doesn't reciprocate those feelings but it hurt when she said she liked me 2 years prior. It especially hurt because I liked her back then as well. Once again my anxiety prevents me from being happy and thats all I want, is too be happy again. It's been at least 4 years of feeling like this.

They'll be happier,"This may be my final post on here, I dont know for sure. This won't harbor much attention I'm positive, since none of my prior posts have.

My only talent is art, and that's it - I know it wont get me anywhere. I do nothing but disgust and disappoint. I really wish I was aborted, never born. I'm a burden, and my parents refuse therapy because it costs money and all they care about is money and my grades. They as well dont believe in mental issues.
I've always been too much of a pussy to consider hurting myself, let alone, ending myself. I know I wont have a future, so why bother with going onward? I'm banal, a dead weight.

i feel like im the hostage of myself,"i dont know but im trying to live life normally and all but there's always this 'voice' or these thoughts that keeps me pushing away from the good things, i just cant accept to try my best for myself. i need to stop what i like doing, ignore persons and all just because of that 'voice' in my head that keeps pushing me down. i've really been feeling down and down and down, all i see is dark, my entire universe is black, there's no light.. every time i find a sparkle it fades away so fast. I just ask for one thing: i want to die.

im the kind of person that cant say no, and try my best to help everyone and to look nice to everyone but i feel so lost inside, i cant make choices. im just doing what that 'voice' keeps telling me but everytime i feel like im getting lower and lower. i've already planned everything for my suicide and if things wont get better, ill just do it. i have nothing to lose. 

sometimes i wish i could have a soul I can ally with to beat that voice... im just lost. i wish maybe something could help me, anyone... help me make decisions. idk i've always been so lonely, and i have big problems socializing because of this 'voice', i might have friends that love me but i feel like im just nothing, and THAT 'voice' just keeps pushing me away from them and from everyone. i try to make new friends, meet lots of people but in the end i feel bad and i end up ignoring everyone and staying hostage of that 'voice'.... i dont get it because when im with people and all i dont seem to be strange or anything i try to tell things so people notice i have problems but in the end im just closing myself with my own thoughts and cant seem to try anything to beat myself on my own game....

Ran out of people to turn to,"I'm 9 years post the hospitalizations/drug guinea pig era and all the bullshit that comes from not having enough money or insurance to afford professionals that won't prescribe you Jesus or tell you withdrawals don't exist and it's purely psychological. Like, to summarize. I'm 24 now and have managed a normal and social life at school and my restaurant jobs when almost 10 years ago just the thought of leaving my house would give me severe panic attacks. Took a long ass time to fix. I got fit and cute and all that and did the [meetup.com](https://meetup.com) things and socialized with errybody like I learned on the internet and stuff.

A year and a half ago my father suddenly gave me a deadline to leave our apartment. Then pushed it earlier and changed the locks while I was crashing somewhere else. He eventually confessed he's uncomfortable having me in his home because of what I went through and just can't have me around anymore. It's insanely fucked up to have that thrown in your face and then some. ""Our"" became his and everything else his wife's.

When I became homeless periodically this past year, none of my friends or family and family friends helped me when I asked or begged. My relatives cut contact again and most of my friends and people I knew never got back to me while others awkwardly explained how we can't be friends anymore. Even people who knew me personally and what I had gone through just stopped responding to me. In person it was this strange distance from them like I'm a stranger to them. I guess reality started unfolding when things got real. You see your true friends when your heart really needs them.

Unfortunately I had a mental break at work during all this and panicked the fuck out into a depression storm and smashed a glass to use on myself in the back of my restaurant. Everyone was supportive that night and my manager got me in contact with the company's employee support fund stuff to put together money for a deposit for a place and anxiety accommodations at work. The next shifts everybody working there behaved as if I wasn't in the same room and would avoid interacting with me. I was fired a few days later and HR did absolutely nothing. I loved that place and made good money but fucked it up in a snap.

I've been homeless on and off and I couldn't get into any shelters with welfare vouchers or go on SNAP/Section 8, etc because I'm one of those DACA people. The good shelters were always full and the social workers would tell me if I know somewhere I can sleep safe, it's better to do that than the overpopulated homeless shelters here in the NY/NJ metro area. So I'd hide in people's backyards and in abandoned buildings in richer towns at night and hang around parks/libraries during the day. My dad offered to pay rent for my own place for now after he found me sleeping in his garage in 15 degree weather thank fuck for that.

Dozens of online job apps and irl job apps done and still nothing. Then the thoughts come over and over and I don't know what to do. Prozac makes me act on the thoughts while no prozac makes me tolerate them in a panic. I stay off it and just tolerate panicking and crying it away. I can't afford school and my own place while working full-time and don't have enough money to renew my DACA. Future is fucked up. The one support I got doesn't wanna talk to me and pays to keep me away. Oof. My mind calmed down after turning this into a vent..

I really fucked up,"I messed up. I screwed up the trust I've built with my boyfriend who has paranoia.

My entire life I was afraid of confronting people. I got it from my parents. I would either get yelled at asking for help or they would help. It scared me that I couldn't confront normally as anyone else would. My boyfriend had problems carrying from toxic relationships he's had and I felt like he was bringing it into ours. I wanted to help him but instead of confronting him first I confronted a friend and told them what was up. The promises I've made to him, broken. I wanted to help him first and I felt that it was necessary. Then, because of all of this, my best friend and he argued and argued and they broke off, a lot of details here are not added because it's personal but I just felt like I'm at the bottom of the food chain. Why be here if I just destroy everything. I broke the trust I've built into him, I ruined a friendship I've had and one of the ones my boyfriend had. I feel like I just don't deserve to exist and I've always felt like that from all the mistakes I make. I just wanted to help but instead, I bring misery. I'm sorry for posting this and dabbling on but I felt like I needed to just choke something out because my heart just hurts from repeating the same thoughts in my head that I'm the worst and it would've been better if my suicide attempt two years ago worked.

Best caliber for suicide?,"Deciding I'm going to end my life and I want it to be as painless as possible. Please don't waste time trying to talk me out of it, I just feel life suicide should be everyones right. 

If I was shooting myself in the head, what caliber is best?

9mm, smaller. Better penetration, but maybe won't penetrate skull? 

.40, feeling like it's the best of both worlds between 9mm and .45, bigger and more power.

.45 bigger, but slower bullet, maybe won't penetrate skull either at point blank range. 

.357 sig, feeling like it should be either this or the .40, although my military friend says .40 sucks and 9mm is better than .40. 

What do you think? Been watching penetration videos on YouTube but obviously none of them are for a skullx or point blank.

I feel like I can’t live without her.,"we dated for a year. i broke up with her because we were arguing all the time and she was always getting mad at me. alas, i could’ve been better about not making her mad but anyways, it happened. she tried to reach out the first two weeks after it happened but i felt that we needed time to mature if we wanted to get back together. i still loved her and wanted to be with her, but i felt we needed time. about a month later, i got back in contact and she had started to try to move on. had done stuff with another guy. i fought. and fought. and fought. and fought. things started to pick up. we were hanging out again. it felt like we were back together. i kept fighting. kept fighting. kept fighting. kept fighting. till about 3 months later when she said she didn’t feel the same anymore. and she’d done stuff with 3 other guys. granted, she’s single and she can do what she wants. i just wish she would’ve told me sooner. she said she’ll always have some sort of feelings for me and that i was the first person she loved. all of this to say, i still am so in love with her and want to spend the rest of my life with her. i really do. i don’t want to live without her. for the first time since i was bullied in middle school (i’m in college now), i’m having genuine suicidal thoughts again. i don’t want to live without her. i can’t stand the thought of not being with her. and her being with someone else. i want that to be me. i want her to love me again and see that i can be the man she wants and needs. i don’t know what to do with myself. i’ve hardly been eating these past few days and just genuinely haven’t been hungry. if i don’t work during the week (i work a part time job landscaping and we work if the weather permits, lately it has not) i just lay in bed and sulk and sleep. that’s all. i don’t know what to do with myself and i don’t want to live without her. she’s moved on and likes someone else now and they spend time together. and i can’t take it. i don’t know what to do.",austinh7298,3,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/fcs773/i_feel_like_i_cant_live_without_her/,dated year broke arguing time wa always getting mad ala could better making mad anyways happened tried reach first two week happened felt needed time mature wanted get back together still loved wanted felt needed time month later got back contact started try move done stuff another guy fought fought fought fought thing started pick hanging felt like back together kept fighting kept fighting kept fighting kept fighting till 3 month later said feel anymore done stuff 3 guy granted single want wish would told sooner said always sort feeling wa first person loved say still love want spend rest life really want live without first time since wa bullied middle school college genuine suicidal thought want live without stand thought someone else want want love see man want need know hardly eating past day genuinely hungry work week work part time job landscaping work weather permit lately ha lay bed sulk sleep know want live without moved like someone else spend time together take know,feel like live without,austin h 7298,1996,37,austin h 7298 dated year broke arguing time wa always getting mad ala could better making mad anyways happened tried reach first two week happened felt needed time mature wanted get back together still loved wanted felt needed time month later got back contact started try move done stuff another guy fought fought fought fought thing started pick hanging felt like back together kept fighting kept fighting kept fighting kept fighting till 3 month later said feel anymore done stuff 3 guy granted single want wish would told sooner said always sort feeling wa first person loved say still love want spend rest life really want live without first time since wa bullied middle school college genuine suicidal thought want live without stand thought someone else want want love see man want need know hardly eating past day genuinely hungry work week work part time job landscaping work weather permit lately ha lay bed sulk sleep know want live without moved like someone else spend time together take know feel like live without
"Constantly thinking about suicide, nothing to live for etc","Lately I've been experiencing more and more suicidal thoughts, I cry all the time and worry about everything. I feel like I have nothing going for me in my life and that the better years are behind me.

"Nobody cares and ""help"" doesnt work","I don't have any friends, haven't for years. I go months without talking to anyone and I cry when I see happy people in public. I have a lot of trauma from sexual abuse+trafficking and it makes me not want to live in such a sick world. I first got diagnosed with depression when I was 8. I don't see a point in going on. People would say it gets better but it's gotten objectively worse every year for nearly a decade. I'll never be healthy enough to have the life I want. I've tried all sorts of things including CBT, DBT, EMDR, yoga, meditation, behavioral therapy, art therapy, etc. I eat healthy, I do everything I'm supposed to. I've tried dozens of medications ranging from anti depressants to anxiety meds to mood stabilizers, all which in the end have either caused a severe health side effect, made me even more suicidal, or made me psychotic.

If you try to get ""help"" and talk to someone about being suicidal in the US you're just apprehended by police, handcuffed, thrown in an ambulance, and shipped off to a psych ward where staff verbally and physically abuses you for the next 72 hours to 2 weeks. (At the youth psych ward by my house they put you in solitary confinement for CRYING). Then you get out feeling even more scared and hopeless, disgruntled with the world and sickened by the fact that this is the ""help"" out there. Then you get more suicidal because you were just abused for days on end and realize there's literally nothing you can do. So you'll get locked in the psych ward again, be treated like shit again, continue getting more depressed, angry, and resentful, rinse and repeat. The system just chips away at you until there's nothing left so that you finally off yourself so they don't have to deal with you anymore.",Foreverhater,4,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/fcqs08/nobody_cares_and_help_doesnt_work/,friend year go month without talking anyone cry see happy people public lot trauma sexual abuse trafficking make want live sick world first got diagnosed depression wa 8 see point going people would say get better gotten objectively worse every year nearly decade never healthy enough life want tried sort thing including cbt dbt emdr yoga meditation behavioral therapy art therapy etc eat healthy everything supposed tried dozen medication ranging anti depressant anxiety med mood stabilizer end either caused severe health side effect made even suicidal made psychotic try get help talk someone suicidal u apprehended police handcuffed thrown ambulance shipped psych ward staff verbally physically abuse next 72 hour 2 week youth psych ward house put solitary confinement cry get feeling even scared hopeless disgruntled world sickened fact help get suicidal abused day end realize literally nothing get locked psych ward treated like shit continue getting depressed angry resentful rinse repeat system chip away nothing left finally deal anymore,nobody care help doesnt work,forever hater,1751,35,forever hater friend year go month without talking anyone cry see happy people public lot trauma sexual abuse trafficking make want live sick world first got diagnosed depression wa 8 see point going people would say get better gotten objectively worse every year nearly decade never healthy enough life want tried sort thing including cbt dbt emdr yoga meditation behavioral therapy art therapy etc eat healthy everything supposed tried dozen medication ranging anti depressant anxiety med mood stabilizer end either caused severe health side effect made even suicidal made psychotic try get help talk someone suicidal u apprehended police handcuffed thrown ambulance shipped psych ward staff verbally physically abuse next 72 hour 2 week youth psych ward house put solitary confinement cry get feeling even scared hopeless disgruntled world sickened fact help get suicidal abused day end realize literally nothing get locked psych ward treated like shit continue getting depressed angry resentful rinse repeat system chip away nothing left finally deal anymore nobody care help doesnt work

"To those concerned with how they look, ""the way you look in the mirror.""","I used to be concerned with my image too, until once I came up with a little thought experiment.

Imagine that you live in a world where you look to others the way you feel, and depending on how good you feel inside how good you appear to others. This is kind of real for hormones and these produce pheromones. Anyone can feel a certain way within, and this has a direct impact in others. Not only that, but the fact that most of the time you are not looking at yourself, the only thing you percieve of yourself is how you feel, so focus on just that.

I’m giving up hope.,It’s been almost a year since I was put on antidepressants and nothings changed. They’ve tried different meds and different doses but it doesn’t work. At first I was slowly giving up but now I just rapidly feel like nobody can help me like I’m just a shit stain everyone walks on and I know for a fucking fact I wouldn’t be missed. Jesus Christ I sound pitiful but god damn it there’s nothing left for me. I’ve been diagnosed with PTSD recently and they tell me that my depression is from the PTSD but Jesus I feel like I’m just another mark on the books of a fucked up people. Every day I hope to fucking god I don’t wake up and every day I do. Everyday it takes me two hours to get to sleep only to have nightmares and wake up after two hours. I’m so fucking tired and I’m so fucking done with trying. The universe has won and I feel like now it’s just waiting with a bowl of popcorn to see how I end.

The Day My Mom Dies Is The Day I Do Too,"My mom is my biggest supporter but also the most sensitive and emotional person there is. When I want her to cheer me up, she starts crying too because she’s so empathetic and it ends up being me who has to cheer HER up. She doesn’t mean to, it just happens. I love her to death but her emotions often comes first. Which makes me not wanna talk to her about my health at all.

I turned 16 yesterday, but I feel like my life is going by way too fast. I’m gay, have no friends and all I do is lie in bed and cry. 

Because I’m gay, I’ll never experience the feeling of having a teenage romance. I’ll never get asked to prom. I’ll never glance at a guy in my class and get a smile or a glance back. I’d say I’m fairly handsome to my knowledge and I try to care for others so it’s not that I’m undateable. It’s just that “everybody’s straight until proven gay”, if you know what I mean.

I just wanna live in a world where I can ask for a guys number without him being weirded out because “he’s not a homo”.

My life is going by way too fast. I’m afraid I’ll be alone forever. I’m impatient. I know I’m only 16. But I’m already so tired of this life. I’m missing out on so much the other straight kids my age are doing. I wanna live their simple life, but obviously I can’t. 

I’m just so tired of everything. I want it to end. I want to believe that I’ll be reborn as a straight guy or girl. To fall in love and having a chance with them. I want to live that life. I want to live an easy life with the only struggle being that the screen on my phone has a crack. I don’t believe in it, I just wish that’s what happens when you die.

But I can’t take my life. I could never do that to my mom. As I said: she’s emotional. She would be heartbroken. She’s been depressed before and I’m certain she would grow into old habits if I were to disappear. 

Sometimes I just wish she would die so I could take my life without hurting her. It’s awful and I’m ashamed to be writing this. I just want everything to end. I want everything to end with my mom.

EDIT: Hey, it’s me a few hours later. I almost become a different person when I have these kind of depressive episodes. Looking back at this post now, I feel bad. I now understand that what I said can come across as ignorant. Which I certainly am. I’m only 16. I have a whole life in front of me. And when I’m feeling this down, I push all positive things about my life away. I have to hold on. I have to wait. My life has barely begun.

I don’t actually want my mom to die. I just wanted to disappear without leaving her behind. I’m feeling better now but I’m sure I’ll come back to this post when I’m sad again.

I'm too stupid to achieve anything in life. I'm thinking of taking my life tomorrow night.,"I have a low IQ. Twice I've been tested and both times I got an IQ around 84-85. Somehow, I didn't do entirely awful in school, I was able to be a B student without much studying. When I actually started studying I started to get grades in the 90s and even some at 100%. Even though I skimmed through with exemplary grades, I barely retained any of what I learned. Nobody around me believes that I am stupid because of my grades, but that is all they go off of. I have a poor vocabulary overall, especially in spoken word, and I cannot do basic mental math. I still count with my fingers and I am nineteen years old. I am from a low income, uneducated family so I was innately disadvantaged from birth, also with having my mom smoke weed and cigarettes throughout her pregnancy with me. During the 8th month of her pregnancy I detached from the placenta and they had to preform an emergency c-section. It is very likely that I have brain damage from oxygen deprivation. 

 I just feel incredibly empty every moment I am awake. My favorite time of the day is when I go to sleep at night, but night always goes by too quickly. Lately I've been spending everyday sleeping because I have much more joy in my dreams. I just want at least an average intelligence, at least. It is unbearable being aware every moment that I am dumb and will only ever be dumb. I have always aspired to leave the financial hole, but everyday that passes reminds me that it will probably never happen. At this point I feel like I am stuck between a rock and a hard place, because I am terrified to leave behind my family and my pets, but I know if I continue living my life will only get worse and worse.

"I wish it was as easy as disappearing into thin air, not a trace or a memory left","I wish there was some way I could will myself into non-existence. I regret my entire life and I know when I take my last breath no matter if it’s by my own hand or not I’ll regret my life. What’s stopping me now is I know if I did it it would probably kill my dad and I don’t want that. I have a daughter too but I feel like she would be better without me because why would you want to have a mom like me? I’m just a doormat for everyone and I go where people tell me. Whenever I ask for help I get it thrown back in my face so what’s the point anymore. I don’t sacrifice enough they say even though I don’t have a life anymore I don’t even have room to breathe I love her but is it selfish too selfish to wish I hd jsut a few hours a week to do something productive for myself. Just get rid of the noise and let me breathe again Why can’t I? I’ve already asked for help but no no it’s just me. It’s all my fault. It’s my fault for not making time for myself but no one seems to understand no matter how much I explain or how much I ask for help. I’m breaking down why doesn’t anyone understand that Doormat doormat even when I stand up for myself to try and not be a doormat the shit gets stomped even deeper into every fiber of my being it feels like agony agony agony. I regret everything I’m fucking miserable miserable miserable. I wish I never existed I wish I never made these ties life is awful, why would anyone ever do this to a sentient creature. Life is so fuckkng  horrible. It’s been so long now I’ve been living like this and it’s agony what a terrible mother I am can’t sacrifice enough, just wish I never existed and I never knew anyone and no one ever knew me",evofe,1,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/fcrfoz/i_wish_it_was_as_easy_as_disappearing_into_thin/,wish wa way could non existence regret entire life know take last breath matter hand regret life stopping know would probably kill dad want daughter feel like would better without would want mom like doormat everyone go people tell whenever ask help get thrown back face point anymore sacrifice enough say even though life anymore even room breathe love selfish selfish wish hd jsut hour week something productive get rid noise let breathe already asked help fault fault making time one seems understand matter much explain much ask help breaking anyone understand doormat doormat even stand try doormat shit get stomped even deeper every fiber feel like agony agony agony regret everything fucking miserable miserable miserable wish never existed wish never made tie life awful would anyone ever sentient creature life fuckkng horrible long living like agony terrible mother sacrifice enough wish never existed never knew anyone one ever knew,wish wa easy disappearing thin air trace memory left,ev e,1677,81,ev e wish wa way could non existence regret entire life know take last breath matter hand regret life stopping know would probably kill dad want daughter feel like would better without would want mom like doormat everyone go people tell whenever ask help get thrown back face point anymore sacrifice enough say even though life anymore even room breathe love selfish selfish wish hd jsut hour week something productive get rid noise let breathe already asked help fault fault making time one seems understand matter much explain much ask help breaking anyone understand doormat doormat even stand try doormat shit get stomped even deeper every fiber feel like agony agony agony regret everything fucking miserable miserable miserable wish never existed wish never made tie life awful would anyone ever sentient creature life fuckkng horrible long living like agony terrible mother sacrifice enough wish never existed never knew anyone one ever knew wish wa easy disappearing thin air trace memory left
