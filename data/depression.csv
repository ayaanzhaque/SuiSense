###Summary###

**Anyone who, while acting as a helper, invites or accepts private contact (I.e. PMs, chat, or any kind of offsite communication) early in the conversion is showing either bad intentions or bad judgement.  Either way, it's unwise to trust them.** 


""PM me anytime"" seems like a kind and generous offer. And it might be perfectly well-meaning, but, unless and until a solid rapport has been established, it's just not a wise idea.  Here are some points to consider before you offer or accept an invitation to communicate privately.

* **By posting supportive replies publicly, you'll help more people than just the OP. If your responses are of good quality, you'll educate and inspire other helpers.** [The 1-9-90 rule](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1%25_rule_(Internet_culture\)) applies here as much as it does anywhere else on the internet.  

* People who are struggling with serious mental-health issues often (justifiably) have a low tolerance for disappointment and a high-level of ever-changing emotional need. **Unless the helper is able to make a 100% commitment to be there for them in every way, for as long as necessary, offering a personal inbox as a resource is likely to do more harm than good.** This is why mental-health crisis-line responders usually don't give their names and callers aren't allowed to request specific responders.  It's much healthier and safer for the callers to develop a relationship with the agency as a whole.  Analogously, it's much safer and healthier for our OPs to develop a relationship with the community as a whole.  Even trained responders are generally not allowed to work high-intensity situations alone.  It's partly about availability, but it's mostly about wider perspective and preventing compassion fatigue. 

* **If a helper gets in over their head with someone whose mental-health issues (including suicidality, which is often comorbid with depression) escalate, in a PM conversation it's much harder for others, including the /r/depression and /r/SuicideWatch moderators to help**.  (Contrary to common assumptions, moderators can't see or police PMs.)  

* In our observation over many years, the people who say ""PM me"" the most are consistently the ones with the least understanding of mental-health issues and mental-health support. We all have gaps in our knowledge and in our ability to communicate effectively.  Community input mitigates these limitations. **There's no reason why someone who's truly here to help would want to hide their responses from community scrutiny**.  If helpers are concerned about their own privacy, keep in mind that self-disclosure, when used supportively, is more about the feelings than the details, and that we have no problem here with the use of alt/throwaway accounts, and have no restrictions on account age or karma.  

*  We all know the internet is used by some people to exploit or abuse others.  These people *do* want to hide their deceptive and manipulative responses from everyone except their victims. There are many of them who specifically target those who are vulnerable because of mental-health issues. **If a helper invites an OP to talk privately and gives them a good, supportive experience, they've primed that person to be more vulnerable to abusers.** This sort of cognitive priming tends to be particularly effective when someone's in a state of mental-health crisis, when people rely more on heuristics than critical reasoning.

* If OPs want to talk privately, posting on a wide-open anonymous forum like reddit might not be the best option. Although we don't recommend it, we do allow OPs to request private contact when asking for support. If you want to do this, please keep your expectations realistic, and to have a careful look at the history of anyone who offers to PM before opening up to them.",t2_1t70,False,,0,False,"Our most-broken and least-understood rules is ""helpers may not invite private contact as a first resort"", so we've made a new wiki to explain it",[],r/depression,False,0.0,,0,False,t3_doqwow,False,dark,,public,1818,0,{},,False,[],,False,False,,{},,False,1818,,True,,False,,[],{},,True,,1572389522.0,text,0.0,,,text,self.depression,False,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;We understand that most people who reply immediately to an OP with an invitation to talk privately  mean only to help, but this type of response usually leads to either disappointment or disaster.  it usually works out quite differently here than when you say &amp;quot;PM me anytime&amp;quot; in a casual social context.  &lt;/p&gt;

,depression,"I've been feeling really depressed and lonely lately from my job, I'm a full time late night janitor for a courthouse just 10 miles away from my hometown. Working there has been pretty easy, but I wound up feeling super lonely a lot considering I don't really get to talk to my friends or hang out with them much.

So just today I came home late as usual, and I have a little interaction with my mom after she made a joke to me that I took pretty personal and felts like was more of an insult rather than a sense of humor. I told her that I didn't really want to joke around like that, but she refused to listen and told me to just go away then. Despite attempting to change the topic and explain why I haven't been feeling so high, all she kept doing was telling what a great mom she is for raising me and my brother while struggling to make ends meet and keep the house. What an ungrateful little bastard I am for not appreciating her hard work and sacrifices. 

At that moment I was legitimately about to begin to cry. But rather instead of pausing and trying to reverse the damages, all my mom did was host a little parental style of the oppression Olympics and proclaim her amount of tears and cries over the course of three weeks. I got out just before my first tear would legitimately run down my cheek. 

And even before I went to bed, she goes on about how her life is more worse than ours than ours, then escalates into a more ""This is why you'd make a terrible mistake getting behind the wheel"" considering I had practice driving this morning. Unaware that she had just lite the fuse to trigger the firework, but she didn't seem to care.

,depression,"A bit of context. I'm an American. I'm black. I'm big. I'm ugly. And I'm autistic. I work as an aircraft mechanic.

The more I go through every day, the less I see the point of continuing with this life. No one who's gotten to know me as a person wants anything to do with me. People make fun of my quirks all the time - they think they're being funny, but they're being obnoxious. Besides that, the only friends I still have are the ones in high school, who are now so far away. My father, the man who cared about me more than anyone else did, passed away a few years ago from sudden heart and kidney failure, while I was waiting on a connecting flight to visit him.

Besides that, people will only connect with me as much as they need to. I clearly have problems that I do not know how to address. No amount of therapy has fixed those issues.

People cross the street when they see me on the sidewalk. Society here in general doesn't like people like me, with so many people supporting an openly racist president as we regress. I know that I won't ever be able to rely on the cops for anything, because I'm likely to get shot before they figure out what the issue is. I've been racially profiled many times when I lived in New York City. I happened to be stopped for every ""random"" drug search whenever I took the Staten Island ferry while carrying a backpack.

That being the case, the only value of any sort I can provide to society is in the job I do. I'm also doing vocational training for a higher qualification, but every day I'm questioning more and more why I care. More money isn't going to fix me as a person.

The prognosis for our world grows more dire every day due to global warming facilitated by old people who don't give a shit about us. There is no reason to believe things will get better - people reject science more and more, and we are going backwards.

I'm not some ""starving kid in Africa"" or whatever other bullshit people push to those who are discontented, but I have still been dealt a pretty shitty hand in life.

I&amp;#39;m an American. I&amp;#39;m black. I&amp;#39;m big. I&amp;#39;m ugly. And I&amp;#39;m autistic. I work as an aircraft mechanic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The more I go through every day, the less I see the point of continuing with this life. No one who&amp;#39;s gotten to know me as a person wants anything to do with me. People make fun of my quirks all the time - they think they&amp;#39;re being funny, but they&amp;#39;re being obnoxious. Besides that, the only friends I still have are the ones in high school, who are now so far away. My father, the man who cared about me more than anyone else did, passed away a few years ago from sudden heart and kidney failure, while I was waiting on a connecting flight to visit him.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Besides that, people will only connect with me as much as they need to. I clearly have problems that I do not know how to address. No amount of therapy has fixed those issues.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;People cross the street when they see me on the sidewalk. Society here in general doesn&amp;#39;t like people like me, with so many people supporting an openly racist president as we regress. I know that I won&amp;#39;t ever be able to rely on the cops for anything, because I&amp;#39;m likely to get shot before they figure out what the issue is. I&amp;#39;ve been racially profiled many times when I lived in New York City. I happened to be stopped for every &amp;quot;random&amp;quot; drug search whenever I took the Staten Island ferry while carrying a backpack.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That being the case, the only value of any sort I can provide to society is in the job I do. I&amp;#39;m also doing vocational training for a higher qualification, but every day I&amp;#39;m questioning more and more why I care. More money isn&amp;#39;t going to fix me as a person.&lt;/p&gt;

Okay so im 22 M I guess I've been dealing with depression for about 8 years. I have anxiety , I'm self conscious and I like to believe im more fucked up than I actually am and if it's okay here I'd like to get it off my chest and talk about my life and where I am now to no one in particular.
I was never the popular kid. I was known but never popular. I was the kid that got picked last for sports or games, never got to play soccer with the other kids because I wasnt good enough, wasnt included in tag or hide and go seek, but I pressed on not knowing what the other kids were bullying me. I got to play lego or slap jack, tic tac toe, you name it, I played by myself. I had about 3 or 4 friends for most of primary school (kindergarten-grade 3). Not knowing how to interact with the other kids I was lonely. I didnt realize I was lonely as it was well normal for me. The world was out to get me and I let it, I had no voice. I didnt know how to stand up to myself for fear of hurting the other person for telling them how I felt. I was never taught how to show emotions or how to use them. Interpret them. I know what they look like and how they feel but showing them? Using them? You'd have better luck getting a volcano to spew water. But this is how I was brought up and its what I knew. Life for me was like looking through beer goggles for everyone else it was distorted and I had a fake image of what it was. Because of this I matured faster in other aspects of life. I grasped adult concepts earlier than most and grew into them. Into worrying about what others think of me, always comparing myself to EVERYONE else, not just the best or the people above me but everyone. I felt like everyone hated me and thought I was some annoying kid so I shut myself off from the world. That's the first few years of life. I ran around as a ""happy"" lonely kid. As I grew up and was about 10 or 11 I learned to read people and guess what they were feeling/thinking, how their day was going n shit. I learned to feed off of everyone's emotions around me rather than feeling my own. I essentially shut off my own emotions without realizing it and now I'm struggling with fixing it. I fed off of the kids that were happy and replicated their happiness as my own, I imitated them and copied them to feel included. I grew up like this trying to fill that big empty lonely hole I felt, i buried it deep down and (as a green swamp friend of mine once said) I became an onion, I made layers to try to hide it but nothing seemed to work. (Sorry this post has kinda became a pity party it was not my Intention, fuck it let's continue) the next couple years of my life pretty much continued on like this, building my wall of fake emotions to ""protect"" everyone else from my greatest enemy... myself, I didnt trust myself to not fuck up, didnt trust myself to really connect with anyone. I lied to everyone around me and pushed anyone away that tried to get close or learn who really was on the inside. It was repulsive and wrong but I didnt know that. I would say this is when I got my first taste of depression around the age of 12. Grades 5-7 I was the class runt/Guinne pig/doormat, I was the kid being bullied. The other kids unanimously decided I was the kid they picked on. Fucking private religious bullshit school did nothing to prevent what they were doing to me nor did they seem to care hell even the TEACHERS  would pick on me. So I accepted ""who I was"" and that was the school fuck up. I tried to take their name tag and wear it with pride. Yea it worked for a bit as armor. I made myself insensitive to the bullying for the first little bit. But grade 6 is when the smack down really started to happen and I became... the germ. These kids had gotten the idea to give me the permanent cheese touch or the germ as they liked to call it. This was the tipping point for me. All my so called classmates and friends I had suddenly turned on me and I was alone. Truly alone, left half dead for the vultures to pick at. I broke. I broke into so many little pieces, all those people I grew up around people I trusted turned. I couldn't touch anyone with out them screaming ""DONT TOUCH ME GERM"" ""GREAT THANKS NOW I HAVE TO WASH MYSELF"" and other hurtful shit like that. They couldn't even sit in a chair I had used without washing it and sanitizing it. Okay I say I was alone but I had 2 friends, payton and dane, they tried to help they tried everything they could but the other kids wouldn't back down. Half way thru the school year I attempted suicide. I had the steak knife pointed at my heart and started pushing, I drew a little blood but it hurt to much so I stuck around. I had only told dane and he kept it quite for a while like I asked him to but one day he told me that he had to tell the teacher, it wasnt something he liked knowing and didnt like how close I was to not being here. So he told that I wasnt feeling good in my head, that I was going thru some tough times due to the class and what they were doing. This teacher had 0 clue that it was happening and immediately went to the principal. Brought me with her and told me to tell her what was going on. I played dumb for so long hoping that it would just end. I didnt want to deal with it but they persisted and eventually brought dane in and asked him what was up. After he started to say something I broke, I told them almost everything. About me wanting to die, not wanting to live and how I wished everyone else would die first. I didnt tell them how i had attempted suicide. My worst fears had come true, I spoke up and now everyone hated me. They couldn't bully me but did they hate me. After the whole class got a ripped a new ass hole for pushing a kid to suicidal thoughts (yes I told them I had thoughts, no I didnt tell them I tried) I came back into the class room and I'm greeted with silence and stone cold eyes staring back at me. The first thing this kid told me (who I thought was one of the people that I had as an acquaintance) ""You know OP fuck you, you go and cry to the principal that we dont treat you nicely well guess what? You want us to treat you with dignity and respect well how about trying to treat us that way? Next time think before you speak"". I can't tell you how much this affected me. That kid got sent home for the rest of the week. This is supposed to be where that part of the story ends right? No those fuckers came back the next and kept calling me the germ, kept bullying me and bullied me harder than before. Grade 7 was a repeat of grade 6. Aging more and more I hid more and more of my emotions and just kept feeding off others and relying on them for how to react in different situations. Elementary school behind me and moving to middle school I made new friends, a new chapter in life. Friendsthat didnt judge, one guy even had the same name as me ""mysteriouslyreddited"". I started to notice girls at this point too. Two girls in particular, quinn and Anna. Quinn is a couple years younger than I had been babysat by my mother and I by her mother, they switched out as they both worked. And she, well Quinn's amazing, pretty no beautiful, shes got these eyes that just, her hair... wow. And her smile (._. ) just everything. She was my first crush although quickly forgotten (we went to different schools. You know out of sight out of mind. K not like that but I hadn't seen her in a while). Anna on the other had, well I can describe her similarly, but things were different with anna. They were. Easier??? Its. Well she was the girl I fell head over heels for and she knew it. We talked for hours upon hours but it was never meant to be. I continued on the same way I did in elementary school, by wearing armor and growing my onion. Anna and I stayed close for a couple years me being wrapped around her finger while she went after other guys. I got her a couple boyfriends reluctantly, I Introduced her to a couple guys I knew she was crushing on and I enjoyed watching her be with them (as i look back i was feeding off of her boyfriends emotions and mixed them with my own. Bad idea 0/10 would recommend.) And well this went as well as you may guess, it went great. WRONG. I was confused and shut off, shut down and shot down. I don't remember what started a fight between us but it went on for months. It became personal for the both of us. I told her not to come to my funeral she told me to fuck off and go die, words were said damage was done and I thought I was okay with it. I learned quickly that I in fact was not okay and my fight with her had broken my armour and I was bare, everything was out and we both fell into depression because of what we did to each other. I was having more and more suicidal thoughts. I had spiraled to my lowest point that I've ever been, self harm, alchohol, skipping school, it was the worst part of my life. Highschool is the hardest for everyone isnt it?? Its not oof my bad. I was skipping school, fighting with my mothers husband, smoking pot and drinking waaaaay to much booze. The fall out of not having anna in my life was ruining me, yes I felt for her and yes i wanted her back in my life but the hatred for her at the same time was almost outweighing the good I felt for her. I cut everyday for over 2 years. I didnt know what to do, the pain felt good and brought me out of my head and prevented me about thinking about anything as long as the blade was on me. My entire depressive episode was brought on because I couldn't stand up for myself or tell myself it's okay or when to stop. I lost myself, lost my armor, lost everything. Or at least I thought I lost everything when in reality I was only just discovering life. I became cold and truly shut off my emotions and didnt even feed off others. I became a robot. I woke up late went to school skipped all my classes, went home played COD or skyrim and went to bed. Rinse repeat and that's how I lived from day to day, month to month, for a couple years. I still haven't reconnected with anna (anna if you end up reading this im sorry for the bad memories. I like to think that we still have some love left for each other but i know that's false). As I lived like this my family life started to become stretched and strained. Being brought up as a christian I was told to believe in god, that hes the answer to all and just ask him for help. I called bullshit and that if he truly cared that none of us would suffer, if we suffer then why the fuck did jesus die on the cross for us? My grandparents and mother didnt take kindly to these words and how dare I speak about god in that manor. After mass one sunday i would have been like 15 we were at the grandparents and the topic of vacations came up and how I hadn't been on one in years and I'd like to go when peeps went down to visit cousins from another town a days drive away. It was spring break and they were leaving next weekend. I inquired if I could go with them and because of my grades I was told no. I told them if they let me go I'd pick up the pace in school and i would try, but only if they let me go. Well my attitude needed to be fixed because the next thing I know my mother is yelling at me and telling me how entitled I am and that Id be lucky to consider even going. Me being the teen I was I yelled back. Fuck yous were exchanged. My grandfather had enough and tried to manhandle me, no fucking chance gramps not in my current state. We had a fist fight that ended up with him having broken glasses, he litterally ripped my shirt off me, ripped my necklace off and threw me into a door and him thrown onto the floor. He got up and started to yell ""get the fuck out of here, you can come back when your damn well ready to apologize until then get out!!!!"". I replied with ""well then I guess it wasnt nice knowing you. When you're ready to get your grandson back track me down and tell me how sorry you are"" and left without looking back. He did track me down the next day and told me he was sorry about how he reacted and stepping so far out of line. That night after we made up and got a blizzard I went home to find my mother's husband fuming because of how I talked to my mother which cause a fight with him. That was the night I lost my home, my family, he had disowned me and cast me out like garbage. Even tho that was one of my lowest points I didnt see it as a loss. Yea i was fucked but i was also free to do what I want when I want. So I started working on myself. I moved to a new city enrolled in a new school and started fresh. While I did climb out of my depressing hole I have yet to beat depression. I got a great girlfriend and living large now adays . Started some anti depressants, counseling and what not. Well now Im gonna skip ahead to why I wanted to get some baggage off my back. A few weeks ago I went out to the bar with some friends and I ran into none other than quinn. I'd had some pregame drinks, had some drinks while I was there. I didnt eat anything that day, was already dehydrated and alcohol should not be consumed like that while on meds. So I was already drunk, feeling great, I'd seen quinn once and didnt know what to say so I just smiled and ""ignored"" her. Well let me tell you it was so fucking hard to ignore her. I mean if you were me you'd find it impossible to. So I did what any drunk man does, i had a shot and approached her, asked if I could buy her a drink and  From what I remember we hit it off. I had a blast but tbh I was not looking for anything in her I just remembe how I used to feel but more Importantly j remembered all the fun times we use to have growing up and all the memories with her over the years. I was.. no i am lonely and she seemed to just kinda be there. So we were talking, and I looked at her and time just seemed to stop. We talked but I don't remember what it was about. At one point I asked if I could kiss her. My self conscience was screaming at me telling me this was not okay but the alchohol was in too deep. There is so much that I wish I could remember about that night but I cant. I dont know what happened what I said or did. This is the hardest I've had to fight this depression in a long time and this time I'm worried that I won't be able to win. I don't recognize who I am anymore. I dont like this person I've become. I love my GF but I feel like I'm going to drag her down and make her depressed like me. I feel like I'm not good enough for her and I'm hurting her by being with her. I cant stop thinking about quinn but I think I fucked up even trying to be friends with her. There was a small spark there but nothing major besides I dont want there to be a spark right now, I've talked to my GF and she knows I have feelings for another. It was hard to deal with at first but after we talked about it she knows that im struggling with my feelings and that I'm not looking for a way to leave her. I've been on the verge of relapsing and going back to self harm. Im not crossing that line because when I do there's no turning back. Im tired of being depressed and I want out but he hardest part is figuring out who i am and if I can keep all my current bridges or if I have to go out and build new bridges. Im gonna keep trudging on and finding my way thru this fucked up place we call earth. Again im sorry this was so long and all over the place, if you read it thanks for listening, if you skip over this story thanks for not wasting your time (that came out wrong but ov well). I'm not looking for help I just need to talk to someone. I am doing okay I just had so much pent up I needed a release.

Okay so im 22 M I guess I&amp;#39;ve been dealing with depression for about 8 years. I have anxiety , I&amp;#39;m self conscious and I like to believe im more fucked up than I actually am and if it&amp;#39;s okay here I&amp;#39;d like to get it off my chest and talk about my life and where I am now to no one in particular.
I was never the popular kid. I was known but never popular. I was the kid that got picked last for sports or games, never got to play soccer with the other kids because I wasnt good enough, wasnt included in tag or hide and go seek, but I pressed on not knowing what the other kids were bullying me. I got to play lego or slap jack, tic tac toe, you name it, I played by myself. I had about 3 or 4 friends for most of primary school (kindergarten-grade 3). Not knowing how to interact with the other kids I was lonely. I didnt realize I was lonely as it was well normal for me. The world was out to get me and I let it, I had no voice. I didnt know how to stand up to myself for fear of hurting the other person for telling them how I felt. I was never taught how to show emotions or how to use them. Interpret them. I know what they look like and how they feel but showing them? Using them? You&amp;#39;d have better luck getting a volcano to spew water. But this is how I was brought up and its what I knew. Life for me was like looking through beer goggles for everyone else it was distorted and I had a fake image of what it was. Because of this I matured faster in other aspects of life. I grasped adult concepts earlier than most and grew into them. Into worrying about what others think of me, always comparing myself to EVERYONE else, not just the best or the people above me but everyone. I felt like everyone hated me and thought I was some annoying kid so I shut myself off from the world. That&amp;#39;s the first few years of life. I ran around as a &amp;quot;happy&amp;quot; lonely kid. As I grew up and was about 10 or 11 I learned to read people and guess what they were feeling/thinking, how their day was going n shit. I learned to feed off of everyone&amp;#39;s emotions around me rather than feeling my own. I essentially shut off my own emotions without realizing it and now I&amp;#39;m struggling with fixing it. I fed off of the kids that were happy and replicated their happiness as my own, I imitated them and copied them to feel included. I grew up like this trying to fill that big empty lonely hole I felt, i buried it deep down and (as a green swamp friend of mine once said) I became an onion, I made layers to try to hide it but nothing seemed to work. (Sorry this post has kinda became a pity party it was not my Intention, fuck it let&amp;#39;s continue) the next couple years of my life pretty much continued on like this, building my wall of fake emotions to &amp;quot;protect&amp;quot; everyone else from my greatest enemy... myself, I didnt trust myself to not fuck up, didnt trust myself to really connect with anyone. I lied to everyone around me and pushed anyone away that tried to get close or learn who really was on the inside. It was repulsive and wrong but I didnt know that. I would say this is when I got my first taste of depression around the age of 12. Grades 5-7 I was the class runt/Guinne pig/doormat, I was the kid being bullied. The other kids unanimously decided I was the kid they picked on. Fucking private religious bullshit school did nothing to prevent what they were doing to me nor did they seem to care hell even the TEACHERS  would pick on me. So I accepted &amp;quot;who I was&amp;quot; and that was the school fuck up. I tried to take their name tag and wear it with pride. Yea it worked for a bit as armor. I made myself insensitive to the bullying for the first little bit. But grade 6 is when the smack down really started to happen and I became... the germ. These kids had gotten the idea to give me the permanent cheese touch or the germ as they liked to call it. This was the tipping point for me. All my so called classmates and friends I had suddenly turned on me and I was alone. Truly alone, left half dead for the vultures to pick at. I broke. I broke into so many little pieces, all those people I grew up around people I trusted turned. I couldn&amp;#39;t touch anyone with out them screaming &amp;quot;DONT TOUCH ME GERM&amp;quot; &amp;quot;GREAT THANKS NOW I HAVE TO WASH MYSELF&amp;quot; and other hurtful shit like that. They couldn&amp;#39;t even sit in a chair I had used without washing it and sanitizing it. Okay I say I was alone but I had 2 friends, payton and dane, they tried to help they tried everything they could but the other kids wouldn&amp;#39;t back down. Half way thru the school year I attempted suicide. I had the steak knife pointed at my heart and started pushing, I drew a little blood but it hurt to much so I stuck around. I had only told dane and he kept it quite for a while like I asked him to but one day he told me that he had to tell the teacher, it wasnt something he liked knowing and didnt like how close I was to not being here. So he told that I wasnt feeling good in my head, that I was going thru some tough times due to the class and what they were doing. This teacher had 0 clue that it was happening and immediately went to the principal. Brought me with her and told me to tell her what was going on. I played dumb for so long hoping that it would just end. I didnt want to deal with it but they persisted and eventually brought dane in and asked him what was up. After he started to say something I broke, I told them almost everything. About me wanting to die, not wanting to live and how I wished everyone else would die first. I didnt tell them how i had attempted suicide. My worst fears had come true, I spoke up and now everyone hated me. They couldn&amp;#39;t bully me but did they hate me. After the whole class got a ripped a new ass hole for pushing a kid to suicidal thoughts (yes I told them I had thoughts, no I didnt tell them I tried) I came back into the class room and I&amp;#39;m greeted with silence and stone cold eyes staring back at me. The first thing this kid told me (who I thought was one of the people that I had as an acquaintance) &amp;quot;You know OP fuck you, you go and cry to the principal that we dont treat you nicely well guess what? You want us to treat you with dignity and respect well how about trying to treat us that way? Next time think before you speak&amp;quot;. I can&amp;#39;t tell you how much this affected me. That kid got sent home for the rest of the week. This is supposed to be where that part of the story ends right? No those fuckers came back the next and kept calling me the germ, kept bullying me and bullied me harder than before. Grade 7 was a repeat of grade 6. Aging more and more I hid more and more of my emotions and just kept feeding off others and relying on them for how to react in different situations. Elementary school behind me and moving to middle school I made new friends, a new chapter in life. Friendsthat didnt judge, one guy even had the same name as me &amp;quot;mysteriouslyreddited&amp;quot;. I started to notice girls at this point too. Two girls in particular, quinn and Anna. Quinn is a couple years younger than I had been babysat by my mother and I by her mother, they switched out as they both worked. And she, well Quinn&amp;#39;s amazing, pretty no beautiful, shes got these eyes that just, her hair... wow. And her smile (._. ) just everything. She was my first crush although quickly forgotten (we went to different schools. You know out of sight out of mind. K not like that but I hadn&amp;#39;t seen her in a while). Anna on the other had, well I can describe her similarly, but things were different with anna. They were. Easier??? Its. Well she was the girl I fell head over heels for and she knew it. We talked for hours upon hours but it was never meant to be. I continued on the same way I did in elementary school, by wearing armor and growing my onion. Anna and I stayed close for a couple years me being wrapped around her finger while she went after other guys. I got her a couple boyfriends reluctantly, I Introduced her to a couple guys I knew she was crushing on and I enjoyed watching her be with them (as i look back i was feeding off of her boyfriends emotions and mixed them with my own. Bad idea 0/10 would recommend.) And well this went as well as you may guess, it went great. WRONG. I was confused and shut off, shut down and shot down. I don&amp;#39;t remember what started a fight between us but it went on for months. It became personal for the both of us. I told her not to come to my funeral she told me to fuck off and go die, words were said damage was done and I thought I was okay with it. I learned quickly that I in fact was not okay and my fight with her had broken my armour and I was bare, everything was out and we both fell into depression because of what we did to each other. I was having more and more suicidal thoughts. I had spiraled to my lowest point that I&amp;#39;ve ever been, self harm, alchohol, skipping school, it was the worst part of my life. Highschool is the hardest for everyone isnt it?? Its not oof my bad. I was skipping school, fighting with my mothers husband, smoking pot and drinking waaaaay to much booze. The fall out of not having anna in my life was ruining me, yes I felt for her and yes i wanted her back in my life but the hatred for her at the same time was almost outweighing the good I felt for her. I cut everyday for over 2 years. I didnt know what to do, the pain felt good and brought me out of my head and prevented me about thinking about anything as long as the blade was on me. My entire depressive episode was brought on because I couldn&amp;#39;t stand up for myself or tell myself it&amp;#39;s okay or when to stop. I lost myself, lost my armor, lost everything. Or at least I thought I lost everything when in reality I was only just discovering life. I became cold and truly shut off my emotions and didnt even feed off others. I became a robot. I woke up late went to school skipped all my classes, went home played COD or skyrim and went to bed. Rinse repeat and that&amp;#39;s how I lived from day to day, month to month, for a couple years. I still haven&amp;#39;t reconnected with anna (anna if you end up reading this im sorry for the bad memories. I like to think that we still have some love left for each other but i know that&amp;#39;s false). As I lived like this my family life started to become stretched and strained. Being brought up as a christian I was told to believe in god, that hes the answer to all and just ask him for help. I called bullshit and that if he truly cared that none of us would suffer, if we suffer then why the fuck did jesus die on the cross for us? My grandparents and mother didnt take kindly to these words and how dare I speak about god in that manor. After mass one sunday i would have been like 15 we were at the grandparents and the topic of vacations came up and how I hadn&amp;#39;t been on one in years and I&amp;#39;d like to go when peeps went down to visit cousins from another town a days drive away. It was spring break and they were leaving next weekend. I inquired if I could go with them and because of my grades I was told no. I told them if they let me go I&amp;#39;d pick up the pace in school and i would try, but only if they let me go. Well my attitude needed to be fixed because the next thing I know my mother is yelling at me and telling me how entitled I am and that Id be lucky to consider even going. Me being the teen I was I yelled back. Fuck yous were exchanged. My grandfather had enough and tried to manhandle me, no fucking chance gramps not in my current state. We had a fist fight that ended up with him having broken glasses, he litterally ripped my shirt off me, ripped my necklace off and threw me into a door and him thrown onto the floor. He got up and started to yell &amp;quot;get the fuck out of here, you can come back when your damn well ready to apologize until then get out!!!!&amp;quot;. I replied with &amp;quot;well then I guess it wasnt nice knowing you. When you&amp;#39;re ready to get your grandson back track me down and tell me how sorry you are&amp;quot; and left without looking back. He did track me down the next day and told me he was sorry about how he reacted and stepping so far out of line. That night after we made up and got a blizzard I went home to find my mother&amp;#39;s husband fuming because of how I talked to my mother which cause a fight with him. That was the night I lost my home, my family, he had disowned me and cast me out like garbage. Even tho that was one of my lowest points I didnt see it as a loss. Yea i was fucked but i was also free to do what I want when I want. So I started working on myself. I moved to a new city enrolled in a new school and started fresh. While I did climb out of my depressing hole I have yet to beat depression. I got a great girlfriend and living large now adays . Started some anti depressants, counseling and what not. Well now Im gonna skip ahead to why I wanted to get some baggage off my back. A few weeks ago I went out to the bar with some friends and I ran into none other than quinn.

,depression,"&amp;#x200B;

My girlfriend wrote me this letter and agreed to share it here... 

&amp;#x200B;

Letter to my depressed lover.

I see you. I know you’re in there. The man who loved and sought joy, the man who felt

deserving of happiness. He is blindfolded, held hostage, cold and chained in a windowless

basement, by a tyrant who thrives off suffering. At times it feels like there is no hope, at

times it feels like there is no escape. You are weakened, the exhaustion has taken over your

body, your mind and your soul, you question whether you’ll ever be strong enough to fight

this mighty tyrant, to escape from his grip, out of the darkness. Will you ever be able to feel

the sun stroking your skin again? Will you ever see the light again? Will you ever feel love

again?

Why are you here? How did you get here? You never asked for this, no one would.

A tyrant is an illegitimate ruler who controls through oppression. Tyranny is not fair, it is not

understanding, and it is cruel. The tyrant wants to weaken you until you have no choice but

to succumb, he will brainwash you until you come to terms with his reign, until you are no

longer a threat to him. The tyrant wants you to think that he is too strong to ever beat, too

mighty to outthink, too present to escape.

But let me tell you something about Tyrants. Anger, hate, always stems from fear, and pain.

Behind every tyrant is a hurt child. Behind every tyrant is a voice that was once unheard, a

heart that was once broken, eyes that were once blinded. The tyrant doesn’t want you to

see the light, because the light was once taken from him, he doesn’t want you to know love,

because love was once taken from him, and he wants you to hurt, because he hurts.

But how can tyranny be defeated? When tyranny is defeated by force, it often just paves

the way for another form of tyranny. You don’t want to kill your tyrant, you’ll be left with

blood on your hands and trauma in your soul, if you kill you’ll have to hide, and what is the

point of fighting your way out of the darkness, just to make your way into another form of

darkness?

No. Your tyrant won’t be defeated by force. He will be defeated by love, and I know that

your love is strong enough to turn him around.

The man that I love finds joy in the little things, the touch of the grass against his feet, the

sight of birds in the trees, the sound of a stick falling on icy water. The man that I love is

surprising, he is unapologetically original, passionate, and doted of a natural humour. The

man that I love is caring and has an emotional intelligence that can make anyone around

him feel seen, heard, and loved. The man that I love is wise, he can offer advice that you

never knew you needed, and he can be the ray of sunshine in anyone’s day. The man that I

love will lighten up entire rooms and soothe even your deepest worries with care and

attention. The man that I love, can love so strongly, so unconditionally, so powerfully, that

he can make anyone’s darkness fade away. So, if anyone is going to bring this tyrant down,

it will be the man that I love.

Love can make your tyrant feel seen, it can make him feel comfortable enough to talk,

comfortable enough to tell you about what pain led him to tyranny. When faced with love,

with a powerful, unconditional love, and an acceptance that is free of all judgment, your

&amp;#x200B;

tyrant will be able to start facing up to his actions, he will be able to start realising that all

along he was causing you to suffer for reasons that had nothing to do with you, they were

never your fault, he was only causing you to suffer, because he was suffering. When that

realisation will spring upon him, he will remove your blindfold and you will see that you are

facing yourself. But don’t worry, it’s just a mask the tyrant originally wore to trouble you, he

won’t wish to do that anymore though, he’ll unchain you and remove his mask, and you will

realise that all along, your tyrant was only a child. Suddenly the anger you felt towards your

tyrant will vanish, because you are a man who is fair, just and loving, you are a man who

doesn’t believe in punishment nor revenge, you are a man who can forgive. You are a man

who can recognise when a child simply needs to be held, loved and nurtured.

So you will take the child’s hand. At first, he will be fearful, he has been hurt before, who’s

to say that you won’t hurt him? But you will give him your word, you will promise him that

he is safe with you, and deep in your heart, you will know that you are telling the truth. The

child will weep in your arms, and you will hold him tighter, you will tell him that he is loved,

he is heard, he is seen, and that from this moment forward, he will never be alone.

You will come out of the basement with the child, hand in hand. And although at first it will

feel like a relief, it won’t be easy. You haven’t seen the sun in so long, its light will feel

blinding and uncomfortable, your body will still feel weak, and as you’ll barely feel able to

look after yourself, you’ll start to wonder how you could possibly look after this child? But

you will surprise yourself. Through the small pleasures you once enjoyed, such as feeling the

cool grass underneath your feet, you will find strength. Enough strength to lift yourself up,

carry the child, and start walking. It will be challenging, and you’ll worry that each step

might be your last step, you’ll worry that you might fall and never find the strength to get

back up, but you’ll keep putting a foot in front of the other, until it starts to feel natural.

Eventually you’ll look up and realise that the sun isn’t as blinding as it was when you first

came out, you’ll see a path, and you’ll know how to get home.

On your way home, you will worry that bringing this child back might be too much of a

burden for me. What if I don’t want him? What if I don’t love him? After all he was once a

tyrant, how could I love him? And what if I don’t even love you anymore? You’ve been gone

for so long, what if I’ve stopped waiting? What if I’ve given up? What if I’ve found someone

else? What if I just end up hurting you and the child more than you’ve both already been

hurt?

But all this time, I’ve been waiting for you. I’ve been worrying, I’ve been crying, you

disappeared so suddenly I never understood what had happened. I made it my mission to

find you, I was up day and night trying to save you, I called on you a thousand times, I

searched for clues in every corner, I even tried to negotiate with your tyrant, but to no avail,

it only angered him more. I tried to get help, but no one could help me, and in the end, I was

left weakened. That’s when I realised that I was exhausting myself, and I wasn’t helping you.

So I did the only thing I could do. I stopped trying to save you and trusted that you would be

able to save yourself, and as I waited for you to do that, I held our space, I nourished our

space so that you could come back to a loving and nurturing home, one where you could

one day feel whole again and heal.

&amp;#x200B;

When you come home, I will welcome your little boy with open arms, and love him, just as I

learned to love the little girl who once held me hostage in a basement. The truth is I already

know your little boy, I’ve seen him in your shadows, and I’ve already grown to love him. You

also know my little girl, she has been living in our home throughout our entire relationship.

She has loved you as much as I have, and although at first she was afraid of you, she was

afraid that you would hurt her, she grew to love you, and she learned to trust you. When

you were gone for so long, she began to worry, she worried that perhaps you would never

come back, she worried that perhaps you didn’t want to come back to us, perhaps you

wanted another home, a different home, perhaps you had stopped loving us.

But I reassured her, and I told her about the love that we shared, the hours and days we

spent looking into each other’s eyes, as time stood still and the world around us vanished,

and we questioned, every day, how we could be so lucky. Our love is the truest love I’ve

ever known, our love is the deepest love I’ve ever known, and I know that a love like ours,

never just goes away.

One day my little girl will meet your little boy, and they will love each other as much as we

love each other, the four of us will build a home so whole, that all our fears will be replaced

by trust, our anger will be replaced by love, and tyranny will be nothing but a distant

memory.

This isn’t going to happen overnight, we don’t want you to exhaust yourself trying to come

home, we don’t want you to run and fall, we want you to make wise and calculated steps, so

that you can slowly but surely come back to us.

If I could, I would be in the basement with you, but you don’t want me there, and if I force

myself into the basement, my little girl will turn into a tyrant again and our home will

collapse. So although I’m not in the darkness with you, know that I can still see you, and I

am still here, holding our fort, waiting for you to find the strength to love your tyrant

unconditionally, so that you can bring him home for us to nurture and heal him, so that he

can learn to fearlessly trust both of us.",t2_sss74,False,,0,False,Letter from my girlfriend,[],r/depression,False,0.0,,0,False,t3_fectqt,False,dark,,public,12,0,{},,False,[],,False,False,,{},,False,12,,False,,False,,[],{},,True,,1583526769.0,text,0.0,,,text,self.depression,False,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My girlfriend wrote me this letter and agreed to share it here... &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Letter to my depressed lover.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I see you. I know you’re in there. The man who loved and sought joy, the man who felt&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;deserving of happiness. He is blindfolded, held hostage, cold and chained in a windowless&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;basement, by a tyrant who thrives off suffering. At times it feels like there is no hope, at&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;times it feels like there is no escape. You are weakened, the exhaustion has taken over your&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;body, your mind and your soul, you question whether you’ll ever be strong enough to fight&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;this mighty tyrant, to escape from his grip, out of the darkness. Will you ever be able to feel&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;the sun stroking your skin again? Will you ever see the light again? Will you ever feel love&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;again?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Why are you here? How did you get here? You never asked for this, no one would.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A tyrant is an illegitimate ruler who controls through oppression. Tyranny is not fair, it is not&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;understanding, and it is cruel. The tyrant wants to weaken you until you have no choice but&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;to succumb, he will brainwash you until you come to terms with his reign, until you are no&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;longer a threat to him. The tyrant wants you to think that he is too strong to ever beat, too&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;mighty to outthink, too present to escape.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But let me tell you something about Tyrants. Anger, hate, always stems from fear, and pain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Behind every tyrant is a hurt child. Behind every tyrant is a voice that was once unheard, a&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;heart that was once broken, eyes that were once blinded. The tyrant doesn’t want you to&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;see the light, because the light was once taken from him, he doesn’t want you to know love,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;because love was once taken from him, and he wants you to hurt, because he hurts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But how can tyranny be defeated? When tyranny is defeated by force, it often just paves&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;the way for another form of tyranny. You don’t want to kill your tyrant, you’ll be left with&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;blood on your hands and trauma in your soul, if you kill you’ll have to hide, and what is the&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;point of fighting your way out of the darkness, just to make your way into another form of&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;darkness?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No. Your tyrant won’t be defeated by force. He will be defeated by love, and I know that&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;your love is strong enough to turn him around.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The man that I love finds joy in the little things, the touch of the grass against his feet, the&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;sight of birds in the trees, the sound of a stick falling on icy water. The man that I love is&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;surprising, he is unapologetically original, passionate, and doted of a natural humour. The&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;man that I love is caring and has an emotional intelligence that can make anyone around&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;him feel seen, heard, and loved. The man that I love is wise, he can offer advice that you&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;never knew you needed, and he can be the ray of sunshine in anyone’s day. The man that I&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;love will lighten up entire rooms and soothe even your deepest worries with care and&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;attention. The man that I love, can love so strongly, so unconditionally, so powerfully, that&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;he can make anyone’s darkness fade away. So, if anyone is going to bring this tyrant down,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;it will be the man that I love.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Love can make your tyrant feel seen, it can make him feel comfortable enough to talk,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;comfortable enough to tell you about what pain led him to tyranny. When faced with love,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;with a powerful, unconditional love, and an acceptance that is free of all judgment, your&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;tyrant will be able to start facing up to his actions, he will be able to start realising that all&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;along he was causing you to suffer for reasons that had nothing to do with you, they were&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;never your fault, he was only causing you to suffer, because he was suffering. When that&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;realisation will spring upon him, he will remove your blindfold and you will see that you are&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;facing yourself. But don’t worry, it’s just a mask the tyrant originally wore to trouble you, he&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;won’t wish to do that anymore though, he’ll unchain you and remove his mask, and you will&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;realise that all along, your tyrant was only a child. Suddenly the anger you felt towards your&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;tyrant will vanish, because you are a man who is fair, just and loving, you are a man who&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;doesn’t believe in punishment nor revenge, you are a man who can forgive. You are a man&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;who can recognise when a child simply needs to be held, loved and nurtured.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So you will take the child’s hand. At first, he will be fearful, he has been hurt before, who’s&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;to say that you won’t hurt him? But you will give him your word, you will promise him that&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;he is safe with you, and deep in your heart, you will know that you are telling the truth. The&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;child will weep in your arms, and you will hold him tighter, you will tell him that he is loved,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;he is heard, he is seen, and that from this moment forward, he will never be alone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You will come out of the basement with the child, hand in hand. And although at first it will&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;feel like a relief, it won’t be easy. You haven’t seen the sun in so long, its light will feel&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;blinding and uncomfortable, your body will still feel weak, and as you’ll barely feel able to&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;look after yourself, you’ll start to wonder how you could possibly look after this child? But&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;you will surprise yourself. Through the small pleasures you once enjoyed, such as feeling the&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;cool grass underneath your feet, you will find strength. Enough strength to lift yourself up,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;carry the child, and start walking. It will be challenging, and you’ll worry that each step&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;might be your last step, you’ll worry that you might fall and never find the strength to get&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;back up, but you’ll keep putting a foot in front of the other, until it starts to feel natural.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Eventually you’ll look up and realise that the sun isn’t as blinding as it was when you first&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;came out, you’ll see a path, and you’ll know how to get home.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On your way home, you will worry that bringing this child back might be too much of a&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;burden for me. What if I don’t want him? What if I don’t love him? After all he was once a&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;tyrant, how could I love him? And what if I don’t even love you anymore? You’ve been gone&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;for so long, what if I’ve stopped waiting? What if I’ve given up? What if I’ve found someone&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;else? What if I just end up hurting you and the child more than you’ve both already been&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;hurt?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But all this time, I’ve been waiting for you. I’ve been worrying, I’ve been crying, you&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;disappeared so suddenly I never understood what had happened. I made it my mission to&lt;/p&gt;

Even before that, I didn't receive a high school education as I spent it all, you guessed it, in my house.

There was a small portion in my life where I actually had friends, 10 years ago, I was active, ""fun"", enjoying my life fairly well but occasionally I was still in the dumps. Most of my friends seemed to be the same way so we talked about it a lot. Of course my friend at the time tried to encourage me, tell me it gets better and kept an eye on me to make sure I was coming out of my shell so to say.

So of course I fucked that up, I made a small mistake, said sorry, they forgave me and I punished myself by not allowing myself to see my friends. Still haven't seen them to this day, besides one, my so. Somehow, they have infinite patience and can put up with all my shit.

I punished myself a lot, I'd cut myself, I'd punch and slam myself, destroy my own possessions. My so tried their best and it sort of fizzled out. These days I don't get the will to do so anymore.

Ever since then, nothing, for a whole 10 years, most of it I didn't even spend time with my mother and younger sister. Maybe I was still punishing myself. I had few hobbies or even things to do, though I didn't fully enjoy any of it, I was starting to feel pretty emotionless.
Towards the end I actually started reconnecting with my mother and finally learning stuff and just starting to connect with my sister.

It was going fairly well for me, I was starting to look at the bright side, I still never left my house but it was starting to feel comfortable instead of a prison.

But then my sister did something unspeakable, something I don't think I could ever forgive, but my mother did, instantly. I was hurt, angry and it pulled me straight back. Ever since I've been weird around my sister, finding it almost impossible to connect and angry at my mother.

So now, I just feel numb, I really don't know what to do, I've been trying to forgive and forget but it's impossible. I've been trying to go outside but I almost have panic attacks just thinking about it sometimes. I'm back to the prison with nothing to do but wait.

&lt;p&gt;It was going fairly well for me, I was starting to look at the bright side, I still never left my house but it was starting to feel comfortable instead of a prison.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But then my sister did something unspeakable, something I don&amp;#39;t think I could ever forgive, but my mother did, instantly. I was hurt, angry and it pulled me straight back. Ever since I&amp;#39;ve been weird around my sister, finding it almost impossible to connect and angry at my mother.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So now, I just feel numb, I really don&amp;#39;t know what to do, I&amp;#39;ve been trying to forgive and forget but it&amp;#39;s impossible. I&amp;#39;ve been trying to go outside but I almost have panic attacks just thinking about it sometimes. I&amp;#39;m back to the prison with nothing to do but wait.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tl:Dr After many years, things started to look good until family trouble, now it&amp;#39;s worse than ever.&lt;/p&gt;

,depression,"I'm at a cross roads. Yesterday, I had a mid term and showed up 50 minutes late. I had actually gotten up that morning to go and take it (my mom took the car extra early and came back late even though I told her that I needed to be at school). Unfortunately this didnt help the fact that I havent been attending school or doing the hwks and labs. My programming professor understood and gave me the slip to go back to do the labs and hwks that I missed. Though again, yesterday I was told that I'm approaching the deadline for this consideration very close and was suggested to take a medical withdrawal by my professor. This year just isnt my year. I feel withdrawn from everything and just cant bring myself to hold onto the shread of stability. Me missing my classes is also something I told my therapist and psychiatrist about. 

My professor wants to hold a meeting with me and my academic advisor to see if there is a way to avoid medical withdrawal and catch up on assignments. I appreciated the consideration until early today, when I realized that I most likely wont be attending lab today either. I cant keep doing this. This is the second time I've taken this class and its gotten admittedly worse. The first time was alright but this time...is terrible. I dont have a support group like last time and I dont have a team. My first time, I was turning in assignments but the lack on my part was not studying for the midterm but I still had a long stride of actually passing then. I feel so uncomfortable in class, I feel like a foreigner.  I get sad because it's  as if I have no idea what's going on around me and it makes me so sad. 

I have a sibling who faced this problem when she tried attending college. She got depressed, started sleeping in and never leaving for school. I dont know why we cant stay in college and actually graduate but it seems like a curse. 


If I leave school, I'm faced with having to leave my school job. If I lose my school job, I wont have any funds. My mother will be leaving me in our hometown and I wont be able to get help from her like I need . I know that if i withdraw, i wont be able to withdraw from one class, I'd have to leave all of them. I didnt have the best if luck from finding work without school ties. So, I'm scared to leave school. I'm diagnosed with depression and GAD. I'd be anxiety ridden and depressed knowing that I'll be holding my grad year back and I wont be able to conjure up funds. 

I wanted to love school. I know I can love learning but I cant seem to love that or anything else right now. I was supposed to be graduating this year but I souldnt be anyway due to needing more classes to complete. I had planned on passing this semester and taking up extra summer classes go shorten time but ...that's all gone. 

I dont know what to do. Should I schedule this meeting in hope of finding options where I dont withdraw and end up pissing away at the possible opportunities? Or just withdrawal, be possibly homeless and come back to school when I'm better? Its hard making a living without a college degree and im worried. I want to stop the self sabotage of depression  but it's as if I can't.

My body is worthless, 6 feet tall and 130 lbs, nobody wants to date a skeleton, and if they do, maybe there is something wrong with them... I can get skinny people, but ones who are bony to the point of concern... I can't get why anyone would be attracted to me. Yet I somehow have a boyfriend.

Whenever I'm about to go to sleep, I take my pink mp3 player to my bed and listen to my favorite songs for hours while imagining myself as a skydiver, princess or a superhero! As I dive into the blue sky I scream so loud that my throat hurts. Maybe if I'm loud enough I won't be able to hear my mother's epileptic seizure as the nice paramedic asks me what I've been reading and if school is going good. I try to ignore my grandma crying while my grandfather just looks away from what is happening. School is going good, I'm really enjoying my art classes.

I like when my teacher praises me, it makes me feel like I'm special - I think as I sit on my bed, with one of my CDs playing in the background.

I'm in middle school. I live in the city now. My school is bigger, more modern and it even has a cafeteria. It's always crowded yet somehow empty at the same time. I no longer have art classes. My teachers say that I'm smart but kind of lazy. All of the girls are so pretty. My cheeks are chubbier than theirs, my legs are thicker and my belly is sticking out. I skip my lunch. Looking at pictures of gorgeous and thin girls on the internet makes me feel full. I hate PE classes. I'm the only girl that can't play volleyball. I hit the ball really hard and now my hoodie is stained red. It hurts but I pretend nothing has happened. Nobody notices. 

High school is scary. Boys don't really like me. Maybe because of the way I dress or because I cut my hair very short. Starving becomes binging. I really hate my thighs. I'm the class clown. I skip school every day for a week. I overdose on medication several times. One time I almost fall down the stairs and pass out in my bathtub after overdosing on some pills. I try to kill myself. When in the ER one of my teachers is there. She looks at me. I can barely stay awake. One of the nurses tells me that I'm selfish. After coming back from hospital my teachers say that I'm the laziest student they've ever had. My mother forces me to lie so they won't put me in a psychiatric facility. I go to the psychiatrist once and never go back. Now my grandma sleeps in my room and they look through my stuff every day. I have to ask to go to the bathroom. My mom makes me stay in the guest room with only a bed, a desk and my textbooks. Dinner tastes awful. I want to die. 

College starts. My major is not that great. I have literature classes. I'm a very average student. Sometimes I remember my elementary school art teacher. I feel like I failed her. Boys still don't like me. My cheeks are still way too chubby. My body is covered in white thick lines. People stare a lot. Some ask questions some just avoid me.

,depression,"I have no one to listen to my problems so I thought I would write them down. Then I decided to post it on here. 

Just moved to a new city and started at a new school. I don't miss anything from my old hometown, I'm actually quite happy to be somewhere else. Moving has been tough though. I had to give up my cat and say goodbye to my friends.

I have kind of 'joined' a group of friends at school. They're all pretty nice. The dynamic of the group is a little weird though. Its like 50% introverts who don't talk much, myself included, and 50% strongly opinionated extroverts. They mostly seem like a nice group of people though. In regard to making friends, things have gone pretty well. Trying to form deep relationships with people is a hard and long process though. It's hard not to get impatient and blame myself though. I feel like I'm being ungrateful because even though I think I've been lucky in finding a group of friends, which is exactly what I want, I still feel so shit.

I've never been diagnosed but I think I could have depression and/or anxiety. I would love to get some medication if it would ease the pain, but I don't want to tell my parents how I feel.

Over the past few years I've thought of suicide probably at least once a month, usually weekly or daily though, and planned it two or three times in my life. I've been thinking about it a lot recently. I've been researching pills I can get at a chemist that I could overdose on and I've found a suicide bridge that's very close to my house. I've been told that I should live for all the good moments in life, but the effort it takes to reach those moments doesn't seem worth it sometimes.

I'm starting to find it hard to trust myself. I'm like a different person from day to day, or even hour to hour. During the brief moments when I feel happy about something I worry about my emotions causing me to do something I regret. When I'm sad or empty it's all I can think about.

There's this girl who's not in my new social circle but who has been really nice to me. She seems like a really nice person. We don't see each other much but she always makes an effort to greet me. I'm unsure whether her intentions are romantic or platonic and it's making me dizzy. I really want us to become better friends or maybe more, but I am not great at social interaction and always make myself feel shit about every little mistake I make. I feel kind of like It'll never happen, yet I spent the whole afternoon texting her. I feel like I'm going insane.

The people I admire most are the ones that seem like the nicest people you could ever know and make you feel happy just being present or after a short conversation and you're always left wanting more from them. I aspire to be like this and make other people happy. I need to remember to smile more though.

Usually I have a high libido but the past two weeks my drive has literally been non-existent. A month ago my shit suddenly became sloppy even though my diet is quite healthy and hasn't changed much, I think it is anxiety causing me to be extremely tense all the time. I just started waking up at 4am every morning out of nowhere and I can't stop. I don't know what the fuck is happening to me.

I feel so lonely. I just want someone to talk to and listen to. Getting to that point with someone new takes time and I'm getting kind of impatient.

I don't know what to do to make myself happy. If things worked out with this girl I think I would be happier, yet the thought of her losing interest in me makes me feel awful.

Its like 50% introverts who don&amp;#39;t talk much, myself included, and 50% strongly opinionated extroverts. They mostly seem like a nice group of people though. In regard to making friends, things have gone pretty well. Trying to form deep relationships with people is a hard and long process though. It&amp;#39;s hard not to get impatient and blame myself though. I feel like I&amp;#39;m being ungrateful because even though I think I&amp;#39;ve been lucky in finding a group of friends, which is exactly what I want, I still feel so shit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve never been diagnosed but I think I could have depression and/or anxiety. I would love to get some medication if it would ease the pain, but I don&amp;#39;t want to tell my parents how I feel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over the past few years I&amp;#39;ve thought of suicide probably at least once a month, usually weekly or daily though, and planned it two or three times in my life. I&amp;#39;ve been thinking about it a lot recently. I&amp;#39;ve been researching pills I can get at a chemist that I could overdose on and I&amp;#39;ve found a suicide bridge that&amp;#39;s very close to my house. I&amp;#39;ve been told that I should live for all the good moments in life, but the effort it takes to reach those moments doesn&amp;#39;t seem worth it sometimes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m starting to find it hard to trust myself. I&amp;#39;m like a different person from day to day, or even hour to hour. During the brief moments when I feel happy about something I worry about my emotions causing me to do something I regret. When I&amp;#39;m sad or empty it&amp;#39;s all I can think about.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There&amp;#39;s this girl who&amp;#39;s not in my new social circle but who has been really nice to me. She seems like a really nice person. We don&amp;#39;t see each other much but she always makes an effort to greet me. I&amp;#39;m unsure whether her intentions are romantic or platonic and it&amp;#39;s making me dizzy. I really want us to become better friends or maybe more, but I am not great at social interaction and always make myself feel shit about every little mistake I make. I feel kind of like It&amp;#39;ll never happen, yet I spent the whole afternoon texting her. I feel like I&amp;#39;m going insane.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The people I admire most are the ones that seem like the nicest people you could ever know and make you feel happy just being present or after a short conversation and you&amp;#39;re always left wanting more from them. I aspire to be like this and make other people happy. I need to remember to smile more though.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Usually I have a high libido but the past two weeks my drive has literally been non-existent. A month ago my shit suddenly became sloppy even though my diet is quite healthy and hasn&amp;#39;t changed much, I think it is anxiety causing me to be extremely tense all the time. I just started waking up at 4am every morning out of nowhere and I can&amp;#39;t stop. I don&amp;#39;t know what the fuck is happening to me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I feel so lonely. I just want someone to talk to and listen to. Getting to that point with someone new takes time and I&amp;#39;m getting kind of impatient.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#39;t know what to do to make myself happy. If things worked out with this girl I think I would be happier, yet the thought of her losing interest in me makes me feel awful.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wow, this ended up really long.&lt;/p&gt;

,depression,"Hi there to all witches who take their craft seriously and really work, I am very deperate and on the brink of killing myself, there is so much to life; this I know. Unfortunately for me every door, every option, every opertunity has been closed off for me since I was born. 
Before I say what I came here to ask here's alittle backstory...

Backstory - throughout my mom's pregnancy the doctors were absolutely sure I was to be born a healthy baby girl, but somewhere along the line something unexpected happened and I came out not only a boy (according to what I've been told and what's written on my birth certificate) I was also unfortunate enough to be born with cleft lip, cleft palette, asthma, droopy eyes(don't know if that's the clinical term, but basically up until I was 8 or 10 [can't remember] I was unable to open my eyes all the way), and various other problems. I have always felt like I should not have been born a boy let alone live past 3 weeks (another failed diagnosis, lucky me right?). 

My childhood consisted of doing stuff to get attention but really all I wanted was to be liked a very hard thing to do when you are basically physically retarded and cannot talk like everyone else and constantly being reminded how you are such a failer that you couldn't even be born right. Since my conciousness first made its way into this world I have found myself thinking as a girl, along with thinking how much better litterally my life would have been if I managed to get it right. My dad was never in the picture so growing up without a father has been difficult on its own, but of course I was informed my dad had the chance to come to America when I was born because of my condition, but he declined to start a new family and I'm sure he had other reasons. My mom always worked all the time so it was pretty much me and my older brother for some time. An older brother that constantly made fun of me along with my mom for how I talked and how I acted. My brother constantly calling me gay, faggot, bitch, you name it he's done it. I'm sure he was unaware of how I felt inside but it traumatized me so much I am afraid of being myself. My body is not shaped how normal guy's are either so I have no idea how to take that problem. At school o was labeled the retarded kid no one liked.

Once I turned 11 my mom met a man, let's call him D. D was/is military and I later found out they got married quick (span of a few months) to finance my surgeries because I came from a background of poverty being single parent with 2 kids (later 3). I was always treated like a pet and always had the harshest and most frequent punishments. I was always forced to do everything for everybody else. My brother had to go do something like talk to a neighbor to get the bike fixed, I had to do it, stuff like that. To this day I get asked by family to buy their plane tickets or order them stuff cause they ""don't know how"". I have always been used all my life. I am nothing but a tool. As I patiently waited for the surgeries that I was supposed to get (atleast just the one to fix my nose and make me look somewhat normal) when I was 12, then delayed to 16, then 18, and finally at 19. I received the first surgery and all they did was make my life a living hell. 

Medical history - The doctor messed up my nose and now theres a glasses size gap on the bridge of my nose, for the tip of it they put cartalage from my side [which they lied to me and took it out of under my right chest] is fat which I didn't even care about having in the first place I just wanted my nose to be straight and deal with the rest later. I was put in a maxillary distractor (fancy name for cage on my head). To move my upper jaw forward so that they can reconstruct the palate (roof of my mouth) and straighten jaw or whatever they were doing I have no clue and it seemed unnessesary to me. It did however improve my speech just a tiny bit. I had to wear this crap o. My head for 4 months. Later I then made my own appointments 2 years later (22) and got a surgery for bonegraft. I am still missing the tooth implant which I cannot afford nor will I ever be able to, and I have to have another surgery on my nose again. I have always suffered from depression because of this but not only because of my unfortunate medical circumstances. (Also I have been getting pains around my abdominal area so either I've got something going on down there that shouldn't be or when I was born the doctors decided it be best to stick a penis on me and call me a boy).

As for the other reasons why I'm highly depressed and on the verge of collapsing. I was forced by my stepdad to go into debt. I wanted to go to college but I wanted to do it like everyone else, a real place surrounded by real people so I can maybe make atleast one friend and not be a total failer. Of course my luck hits home again and he forced me to go to an online college with the promiss of letting me use the money the army provides to him for school use. I agree and then he turns and days ""yea no... Do it yourself"". Landing me 16k debt that I can't pay, 3k I was forced to pay (just to get my diploma) and 3k my mom was forced to pay for me to be able to enroll in classes. Before this though I was planning to join the military to get a one up on life, but apparently not God's plan. Since when I brought up the idea he straight refused. I was not allowed to work or go out, I did not have an allowance or any type of money except money I got for my birthday ($20 every year, ages 18-19-20) and it didn't help that I had no friends up until senior year in highschool (that summer is the only happy memories I have after leaving my home town. He was very controlling that's why I feel I can't do anything without the constant reminder of all the trauma I've faced.

I did however keep the promis I made to myself about joining the military. Unfortunately though I was not let in. After two years of waiting and providing all of the medical paperwork I was finally sent to MEPS for the Marines, finally a chance for me to straighten out my life and man up and get all these rediculous thoughts and feelings out my head. NOPE! Once I get there I take the ASVAP and score on the higher side (I know right smarts actually came in handy I might look like a retard but my mental capacity is on the higher side) scored 80. Go through medical everything good up until the physical, the doctor asks me if I always been tall and skinny (I have a very feminine body besides the lack of breasts and having a penis) I say yes, normal ok cool then I go to the eye exam and they tell me I have astigmatism in my left eye (this I knew it happened when I was about 5 or so, started hallucinating and seeing giant spiders with extream detail) I went to see if I can get this fixed they said and I quote ""the damage to your eye is so savire that we do not have the equipment required to even make a dent of progress, the best solution I can offer is to use the effected eye and hope it gets better over time, sorry but there is nothing we can do for you at this time."" - Lasik doctor. So dream job at Marines = no go. The MEPS people tell me to try the army cause they accept pretty much anyone. I do and same thing they say I can't join because of my stupid eye, gee thanks God. 

At this point I start thinking maybe it's not meant to be and give up. 

My job history is halarious, atleast to me. Almost even didn't get hired. First job at age 20, McDonald's. Mom gets a house with my brother who got to live my fantasy of being in the military and travel the world, who then decides to mock me and make my life even worse by deciding he needs a surgery on his penis (he thought it was so curved he can't have sex yet he never tried, now he's depressed and thinks he can never have it and the doctor messed up, doctor also gave him circomsition) this happened during my attempt at joining the Marines. Throughout the course of 6 months he would constantly scream at the top of his lungs and say how God hates him, this is punishment, lash out at me for no reason, and make me feel not only unsafe but want to take my own life even more just to get out of that situation. Once we move into the new house this continues along with me every day for months on end calming him down explaining and telling him to be patient cause it's not gunna heal right away and healing of the body depends on the mind state anyways. Because of the move I am forced to quit my job that I actually enjoyed, to transfer to another McDonald's on the side of town we moved to (two towns down) I work there for 6 months before quitting because of how unfairly I was being treated, everything was my fault, I never did anything right, I was lazy, the works (even though I did mainly everybody's job in the kitchen, everyday I washed the grill swept mopped multiple times a day, I would be on grill then on the table making the burgers, I'd go and get the 50 pound boxes from the freezer. You name it I did it.) I eventually quit after 6 months bought a one way ticket to California and said my goodbyes to my brother who called my mom crying saying I left and he tried to stop me... I was sick of his shit. I had shit I was dealing with all my life and now I have to deal with you and your problem too, (excuse the langauge but) fuck outta here with that shit. 
I have so little control over my own life that I only spent 2 days in California before my mom told the entire family where I was and got my aunt (grandma's sister so technically grandma, who's also a nun) to somehow convince me to go to New York and stay with my uncle. I can't believe I actually fell for their stupid guilt trip but somehow after only 5 days I was off to NYC. I told myself it's probably best since there are lots of opportunities for me to be a musican. Wrong. I was basically plummited into the same exact situation with different people. Greedy money hungry aunt, no jobs, no money, an uncle who works at night sleeps durring the day, wierd daughter that turned into her mother. I had to get outta there it got to the point where she was looking through my stuff while I wasn't there to find proof I could pay her $700 to stay in the shitty, stinky room they kept rabbits in. With a door that locks from the outside and a broken window, very small room at that. After two months of looking for jobs while making music simaltaniously I am being called a liar I good for nothing a lazy bum you name it that's what she labeled me. I manage to get a job at McDonald's again but in NY. I manage to set up the bonegraft appointment and lay on an air mattress for two weeks feeling useless and being called useless. I go back to work and then move into my grandpa's room he was renting. Lucky for me he was on vacation for the next two months. Durring this time when my granpa came back j felt obligated and wanted to help with his bills ultimately giving him what little I had. 4 months pass and after much consideration and mom/brother begging for me to come back I oblige. 
I then get a job at another McDonald's in the next town over oppisate direction with the help of my old boss. I work there for 6 months before quitting because of the same drama the first time and hearing people continuously talking shit about me making me feel terrible about myself even more and with the emense parinoia I was experiencing due to smoking too much (the parinoia was about how I hid the fact I'm not normal and that I wish to be a girl and intricate details of my life).

If you think that's it well your wrong... My aunt comes to the USA on a visa and is put in a shit situation feeling unsafe, according to her. My mom is the only one in the USA she knows, mom folds and buys her a plane ticket to stay here for the time being, money my mom didn't have, which is fine desperate times desperate measures and such. She stays here for an entire month and quickly realises there is nothing here, everything is far and you have to drive everywhere. The time that she was here I could have used to work on my music the 3 hours I was left alone in the house, but no. 
Everything that she bought or well made me buy she complains and says it's for someone else, complains she didn't buy anything for herself and how she had to use my mom's clothes cause instead of buy things for herself she bought for everyone else supposedly. She then says how she needs a phone and makes me go find one for her. After I go through the trouble of finding and iPhone 7 plus for a crazy deal ($150) which they usually go for 300-350 I go and I borrow money to go get her the phone. She then says oh... I wanted a more modern one....like yours.... I'm like ugh ok I reset mine give her it and she then says she will give me the 150 (my phone was iPhone X pristine condition). Months pass I still don't have a job (stopped looking to focus on getting my licence), everybody keeps making excuses not to teach me, and the piece of crap car that my brother was going to pass down to me needs a new battery so I can't use it, and he also decided to retract the offer before I got the chance to use it and is selling it because he doesn't want to pay for it. He is not rich but wealthy $40k in the bank meanwhile I'm 30k in debt 12 of which collectors are being sent now. 

Debt - borrowed money I didn't have to help pay bills to not be called worthless and useless. Borrowed too much then took 5k out and ran away to California

That brings me to the present day, some details have been left out as to not make this extreamly long.
(Side note: I have always liked girls but it's more like an admiration/envy type of thing, always wishing I was one cause I always felt just wrong in my own body)

Ok TL;DR shit life should have been born a girl, instead I came out with so many problems and mental issues along with the traumatizing circumstances I was put in and the problems still continue.",t2_5v0ktidy,False,,0,False,"My life story, I am sorry it's so long",[],r/depression,False,0.0,,0,False,t3_fecspk,False,dark,,public,3,0,{},,False,[],,False,False,,{},,False,3,,False,,False,,[],{},,True,,1583526600.0,text,0.0,,,text,self.depression,False,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hi there to all witches who take their craft seriously and really work, I am very deperate and on the brink of killing myself, there is so much to life; this I know. Unfortunately for me every door, every option, every opertunity has been closed off for me since I was born. 
Before I say what I came here to ask here&amp;#39;s alittle backstory...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Backstory - throughout my mom&amp;#39;s pregnancy the doctors were absolutely sure I was to be born a healthy baby girl, but somewhere along the line something unexpected happened and I came out not only a boy (according to what I&amp;#39;ve been told and what&amp;#39;s written on my birth certificate) I was also unfortunate enough to be born with cleft lip, cleft palette, asthma, droopy eyes(don&amp;#39;t know if that&amp;#39;s the clinical term, but basically up until I was 8 or 10 [can&amp;#39;t remember] I was unable to open my eyes all the way), and various other problems. I have always felt like I should not have been born a boy let alone live past 3 weeks (another failed diagnosis, lucky me right?). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My childhood consisted of doing stuff to get attention but really all I wanted was to be liked a very hard thing to do when you are basically physically retarded and cannot talk like everyone else and constantly being reminded how you are such a failer that you couldn&amp;#39;t even be born right. Since my conciousness first made its way into this world I have found myself thinking as a girl, along with thinking how much better litterally my life would have been if I managed to get it right. My dad was never in the picture so growing up without a father has been difficult on its own, but of course I was informed my dad had the chance to come to America when I was born because of my condition, but he declined to start a new family and I&amp;#39;m sure he had other reasons. My mom always worked all the time so it was pretty much me and my older brother for some time. An older brother that constantly made fun of me along with my mom for how I talked and how I acted. My brother constantly calling me gay, faggot, bitch, you name it he&amp;#39;s done it. I&amp;#39;m sure he was unaware of how I felt inside but it traumatized me so much I am afraid of being myself. My body is not shaped how normal guy&amp;#39;s are either so I have no idea how to take that problem. At school o was labeled the retarded kid no one liked.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once I turned 11 my mom met a man, let&amp;#39;s call him D. D was/is military and I later found out they got married quick (span of a few months) to finance my surgeries because I came from a background of poverty being single parent with 2 kids (later 3). I was always treated like a pet and always had the harshest and most frequent punishments. I was always forced to do everything for everybody else. My brother had to go do something like talk to a neighbor to get the bike fixed, I had to do it, stuff like that. To this day I get asked by family to buy their plane tickets or order them stuff cause they &amp;quot;don&amp;#39;t know how&amp;quot;. I have always been used all my life. I am nothing but a tool. As I patiently waited for the surgeries that I was supposed to get (atleast just the one to fix my nose and make me look somewhat normal) when I was 12, then delayed to 16, then 18, and finally at 19. I received the first surgery and all they did was make my life a living hell. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Medical history - The doctor messed up my nose and now theres a glasses size gap on the bridge of my nose, for the tip of it they put cartalage from my side [which they lied to me and took it out of under my right chest] is fat which I didn&amp;#39;t even care about having in the first place I just wanted my nose to be straight and deal with the rest later. I was put in a maxillary distractor (fancy name for cage on my head). To move my upper jaw forward so that they can reconstruct the palate (roof of my mouth) and straighten jaw or whatever they were doing I have no clue and it seemed unnessesary to me. It did however improve my speech just a tiny bit. I had to wear this crap o. My head for 4 months. Later I then made my own appointments 2 years later (22) and got a surgery for bonegraft. I am still missing the tooth implant which I cannot afford nor will I ever be able to, and I have to have another surgery on my nose again. I have always suffered from depression because of this but not only because of my unfortunate medical circumstances. (Also I have been getting pains around my abdominal area so either I&amp;#39;ve got something going on down there that shouldn&amp;#39;t be or when I was born the doctors decided it be best to stick a penis on me and call me a boy).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As for the other reasons why I&amp;#39;m highly depressed and on the verge of collapsing. I was forced by my stepdad to go into debt. I wanted to go to college but I wanted to do it like everyone else, a real place surrounded by real people so I can maybe make atleast one friend and not be a total failer. Of course my luck hits home again and he forced me to go to an online college with the promiss of letting me use the money the army provides to him for school use. I agree and then he turns and days &amp;quot;yea no... Do it yourself&amp;quot;. Landing me 16k debt that I can&amp;#39;t pay, 3k I was forced to pay (just to get my diploma) and 3k my mom was forced to pay for me to be able to enroll in classes. Before this though I was planning to join the military to get a one up on life, but apparently not God&amp;#39;s plan. Since when I brought up the idea he straight refused. I was not allowed to work or go out, I did not have an allowance or any type of money except money I got for my birthday ($20 every year, ages 18-19-20) and it didn&amp;#39;t help that I had no friends up until senior year in highschool (that summer is the only happy memories I have after leaving my home town. He was very controlling that&amp;#39;s why I feel I can&amp;#39;t do anything without the constant reminder of all the trauma I&amp;#39;ve faced.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I did however keep the promis I made to myself about joining the military. Unfortunately though I was not let in. After two years of waiting and providing all of the medical paperwork I was finally sent to MEPS for the Marines, finally a chance for me to straighten out my life and man up and get all these rediculous thoughts and feelings out my head. NOPE! Once I get there I take the ASVAP and score on the higher side (I know right smarts actually came in handy I might look like a retard but my mental capacity is on the higher side) scored 80. Go through medical everything good up until the physical, the doctor asks me if I always been tall and skinny (I have a very feminine body besides the lack of breasts and having a penis) I say yes, normal ok cool then I go to the eye exam and they tell me I have astigmatism in my left eye (this I knew it happened when I was about 5 or so, started hallucinating and seeing giant spiders with extream detail) I went to see if I can get this fixed they said and I quote &amp;quot;the damage to your eye is so savire that we do not have the equipment required to even make a dent of progress, the best solution I can offer is to use the effected eye and hope it gets better over time, sorry but there is nothing we can do for you at this time.&amp;quot; - Lasik doctor. So dream job at Marines = no go. The MEPS people tell me to try the army cause they accept pretty much anyone. I do and same thing they say I can&amp;#39;t join because of my stupid eye, gee thanks God. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At this point I start thinking maybe it&amp;#39;s not meant to be and give up. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My job history is halarious, atleast to me. Almost even didn&amp;#39;t get hired. First job at age 20, McDonald&amp;#39;s. Mom gets a house with my brother who got to live my fantasy of being in the military and travel the world, who then decides to mock me and make my life even worse by deciding he needs a surgery on his penis (he thought it was so curved he can&amp;#39;t have sex yet he never tried, now he&amp;#39;s depressed and thinks he can never have it and the doctor messed up, doctor also gave him circomsition) this happened during my attempt at joining the Marines. Throughout the course of 6 months he would constantly scream at the top of his lungs and say how God hates him, this is punishment, lash out at me for no reason, and make me feel not only unsafe but want to take my own life even more just to get out of that situation. Once we move into the new house this continues along with me every day for months on end calming him down explaining and telling him to be patient cause it&amp;#39;s not gunna heal right away and healing of the body depends on the mind state anyways. Because of the move I am forced to quit my job that I actually enjoyed, to transfer to another McDonald&amp;#39;s on the side of town we moved to (two towns down) I work there for 6 months before quitting because of how unfairly I was being treated, everything was my fault, I never did anything right, I was lazy, the works (even though I did mainly everybody&amp;#39;s job in the kitchen, everyday I washed the grill swept mopped multiple times a day, I would be on grill then on the table making the burgers, I&amp;#39;d go and get the 50 pound boxes from the freezer. You name it I did it.) I eventually quit after 6 months bought a one way ticket to California and said my goodbyes to my brother who called my mom crying saying I left and he tried to stop me... I was sick of his shit. I had shit I was dealing with all my life and now I have to deal with you and your problem too, (excuse the langauge but) fuck outta here with that shit. 
I have so little control over my own life that I only spent 2 days in California before my mom told the entire family where I was and got my aunt (grandma&amp;#39;s sister so technically grandma, who&amp;#39;s also a nun) to somehow convince me to go to New York and stay with my uncle. I can&amp;#39;t believe I actually fell for their stupid guilt trip but somehow after only 5 days I was off to NYC. I told myself it&amp;#39;s probably best since there are lots of opportunities for me to be a musican. Wrong. I was basically plummited into the same exact situation with different people. Greedy money hungry aunt, no jobs, no money, an uncle who works at night sleeps durring the day, wierd daughter that turned into her mother. I had to get outta there it got to the point where she was looking through my stuff while I wasn&amp;#39;t there to find proof I could pay her $700 to stay in the shitty, stinky room they kept rabbits in. With a door that locks from the outside and a broken window, very small room at that. After two months of looking for jobs while making music simaltaniously I am being called a liar I good for nothing a lazy bum you name it that&amp;#39;s what she labeled me. I manage to get a job at McDonald&amp;#39;s again but in NY. I manage to set up the bonegraft appointment and lay on an air mattress for two weeks feeling useless and being called useless. I go back to work and then move into my grandpa&amp;#39;s room he was renting. Lucky for me he was on vacation for the next two months. Durring this time when my granpa came back j felt obligated and wanted to help with his bills ultimately giving him what little I had. 4 months pass and after much consideration and mom/brother begging for me to come back I oblige. 
I then get a job at another McDonald&amp;#39;s in the next town over oppisate direction with the help of my old boss.

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m thinking about just ending it sometimes... But I don&amp;#39;t want to cause my family and friends any unnecessary sorrow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I hate it. I hate myself. I hate my life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you read so far, thank you.&lt;/p&gt;

,depression,"I'm drowning over here. I'm failing every single person in my life, being criticized by every single person in my life, being controlled by every single person in my life, and I don't know how to deal.

My abusive ex is fighting for custody of our daughter. He'll be granted overnights in a few weeks, when he's never spent more than six hours with her. She's going to be so scared. She's too young to understand why her mom isn't there. I've tried suggesting we transition slowly but he's refusing to do so unless I give him six more hours a week, ""in good faith.""

I have two weeks to pay $2k to a court appointed person, that I didn't ask for and can't get rid of, or I'll be held in contempt of court, resulting in a fine or jail time, even though I'm unemployed for another couple months. My dad is well able to help, but won't, because he ""doesn't want to get involved,"" but not because he isn't financially able.

My boyfriend is completely minimizing AND demonizing my feelings. Every single time I point out a problem, he plays victim and turns it around on me. When he picks on me and it hurts my feelings, I just need to toughen up and trust that he doesn't mean it. When I get upset that he tells me what to do, I just need to let go of this hatred for imagined authority. When he's super stressed to the point of being 85% negative all the time and I'm feeling neglected and unloved because of it, I just need to keep my feelings to myself because he doesn't need guilt on top of his stress.

My baby has been sick so she hasn't been sleeping well. She woke up at 4:30 this morning, when she normally gets up at 6:30, and I was trying to get her back down. Well I also live with my parents. And my stepdad told my mom that I was yelling at my daughter and stomping around the room to intimidate her, which isn't at all true. When I told my boyfriend that I was being stern with her, not yelling, he said that maybe I should change my stern voice because apparently it scares people. 

So yes, let me just do whatever the fuck everyone wants me to do and be who they want me to be because I have no autonomy or authority over my over damn life. Let me stop expressing my emotions, which means stop having emotions all together, to please all these fuckers in my life. Let me change something I don't even feel I'm doing *wrong* just to make someone else fucking happy.

And if I'm not happy?

Well, that's just too bad! Because apparently everyone else's feelings matter but mine.

I don't want to die, but I can't fucking live like this. Every waking moment of my life is just trying to please someone else. It's putting everyone else above me because if I don't, I'll be chastised or belittled or berated. No one can just let me be me and do what I do because they think they have some fucking hold on me and should be able to control what I do and say and think and feel.

I can't fucking LIVE like this. Who fucking can? But there's no way out. I'm unemployed until the summer. So I have to live with my parents. I have to listen to their bullshit. I can't get my ex to stop stalking me and harassing me and insulting me. The court is refusing to hold him accountable. I can't force my dad to keep me out of jail for something I have zero control over. I can't get my boyfriend to be more considerate of my feelings, but I can't break up with him either because then I'll *completely* fall apart. Those good moments with him are literally the only things keeping me functioning.

I honestly feel like if I didn't have skin, I'd be shattered. Not even just shattered, in pieces. Like a broken piece of tempered glass, split into so many pieces that they're impossible to count, and I get cut by them every single time I move. Just a walking, breathing flesh bag of blood and fragments.

My GP can only organise pills for me. I have no way of acquiring a therapist. I have been severely depressed for past couple of weeks and mildly since about November.

I don't have a trusted parent, sibling or a friend that I could open up to. I tried a while ago but I ask to support me in functioning day to day, pushing me to work and they just tell me they're sorry or they wish they could help. You know, the empty ""You can talk to me, it will get better"". Then they cut contact. My boyfriend just says he doesn't know how to help me and has phases of randomly complimenting me or texting me to tell me he loves me for two days straight then he forgets all about it. I'm sure he tries his best but I just wish I had more support and he says ""he can't help me anymore than he does"" everytime. I feel so trapped. I always have to pretend I'm fine. I always cover up with humor. It seems like I'm insincere or dramatic when I finally snap and just say I'm a mess. 

I can't afford a therapist. My university counselling office won't help me. They offered a suicide hotline numbers (?) and  ""we're sorry but this isn't a psychological support that we do here"".

How to cope? Where to go?

,depression,"My dad is an immigrant and came the US in his 30’s after he married my 18 year old mother who was studying abroad in his home country.

He quickly became financially successful and moderately famous in his industry. Things that came to define him above anything else.

My parents had me 11 years into their marriage and I have no siblings. 

I was homeschooled for most of my childhood and super sheltered from everything in life. Never allowed to have sleepovers, rarely allowed to have friends over, had every moment of my life scheduled and micromanaged.  I was never encouraged to pursue anything except becoming a professional soccer player (which was never what I wanted to do, but something my dad wanted me to do as a way to live out his dreams through me vicariously.) 

He was never around. He financially supported me and my mom and lived in the same city as us most of the time, but was never there to parent me and was rarely even around on holidays or birthdays. He kept his things at our house, but came home maybe once a month, sometimes less. He always said he needed to be closer to work so he was staying at his friend’s house (everything in the whole city is a 30 minute drive or less, and he never worked for anyone but himself.) 

Now that I’m an adult, I understand he was living with various girlfriends though he was still married to my mom, and she always seemed to be waiting up for him to come home and finally be a dad/husband. 

I developed severe anorexia at 12, and my family seemed to ignore it even though I stopped growing, lost 40 pounds, was rarely eating, and was exercising 4-6 hours a day. When I was literally weeks away from death with a BMI of &lt;12, my mom finally took me to a doctor after my grandma begged her to because “something was really wrong with me.” The doctor told her I was  anorexic and recommended in-patient treatment and psychotherapy. My mom yelled at the doctor, said “there’s no way MY daughter is anorexic,” and stormed out of the office. 

For the next 6 months or so, I stayed at the same weight and, nightly, would sit down at the dinner table with my mom and cry for hours while she screamed at me to finish my food. I never went to therapy for the eating disorder and she denied every doctor who told her I was mentally ill. She was SURE I had tapeworms, a thyroid disease, celiac, or some other ailment that had caused me to lose 40% of my body weight. I stayed at a dangerously low weight until I was 16, which is the first year I went to school, and traded my ED for nightly sneaking out, binge drinking, and bulimia. 

When I was 16, I was almost arrested for trying to buy alcohol, and my dad found out and told me if I wanted alcohol I could just ask him. He started helping me sneak out and giving me alcohol whenever I wanted. I think he did this to drive a wedge between my mom and me, he always loved to have secrets that we would keep from her. He would take me around his 23 year old girlfriend and tell me to not tell my mom. In fact, he would blackmail me, saying things like “don’t tell mom about so and so, you would hate for her to find out about you sneaking out and partying right?” 

When I was 17, my dad lost all his businesses and wealth, and has still been unable to recover from the financial loss. He pinned all his happiness on money, and once it was gone he changed completely. Every time I’ve talked to him since then, all he’s talked about is how broke he is and how my mom caused his financial ruin and what a stupid idiot she is. He curses my mom around me almost every time he talks to me.

He had a long talk with me one night when I was 16. He told me that I should never have kids because they’ll ruin my life. He never wanted kids. He would be a multi millionaire and so happy and free if he had never had a family. My mom is a crazy lunatic and has only ruined his life and finances. 

I fell into a horribly abusive, 4 year relationship with a guy when I was 17. I bounced around from college to vocational school, and also had a moderately successful entertainment career. I’ve never been able to find footing anywhere. I feel like I can’t connect with anyone. I really don’t feel passion for anything and don’t feel like there’s any path in life that I want to take, though I do feel like I’m talented in multiple things. I’m awful at romantic relationships and friendships (maybe because I never had a healthy relationship example from my family, and never had long term friendships when I was growing up?) 

About a year ago, I was talking with my dad about how I wanted to get a job that made a lot of money like bottle service. He suggested I become a stripper. And so I did. I danced for a year, and he insisted I call him and tell him how much money I made every night, and he acted like I was so lucky because he “gave me permission” to do this. Like wtf I’m a grown adult who’s been living on my own since 18, and god knows I was putting in the work all on my own for all the money I made. 

Every time I see him he’s so negative and toxic and I realize now that a lot of the anxiety and problems I felt as a child (I’ve been suicidal literally since I can remember) stemmed from the insane toxic energy that always engulfed my family life. 

I’ve done a lot of psychedelics, and I really do have a good grip on spirituality and mindfulness, and know there’s something way bigger than this earth plane we live on. There are light forces and dark forces. The thing is, lately, I just don’t feel like I am meant to be blessed by the light forces. Like I was born out of darkness from a cursed family, and I am doomed to be miserable, depressed, and toxic just like my dad. He is not a good person. I think he’s a narcissistic sociopath and it scares me that half of my genes come from that. 

His dad was a total narcissist, no respect for women, I felt unexplainably awful vibes from him always. My paternal grandfather had a very successful business when he was younger, but somehow that all dissolved and he ended up completely broke with nothing to leave to his family, dementia, and a mindset that his children should take care of him (which they did, until his death last year.) My aunt put herself through unspeakable stress and pain to take care of my grandfather, who was completely ungrateful for it. 

Most of my dad’s family has ended up in a mental hospital by 70, and they’re all completely depressed or mentally ill, and I feel the same demons taking me under every day. I’ve felt dark forces around me since I can remember. I’ve seen my demons during nightmares and sleep paralysis. I think my abusive ex-boyfriend was influenced by the demons that follow me around. 

I can’t see anything good happening in my life long term. I fear I’m going to end up like everyone on my dad’s side. I recently talked about a lot of this stuff with my mom and she started crying and said she’s failed me in every way, she should’ve left my dad when I was little, and she wishes she never even married him because she was a teenager and literally only knew him for a few months before they got married. That hit so hard, because it just made me feel like my whole life was never even supposed to happen. I was just part of one giant fucked up mistake made by a naive 18 year old. 

I feel like I’m a lost soul, I wasn’t meant to exist, and because of that the dark energy got ahold of me. 

I don’t want to talk to my dad anymore. Am I wrong? I am questioning everything and I really hope I don’t live that long because I don’t see anyone in that family having any glimmer of a nice life over age 55. 

No one takes me seriously when I say my childhood fucked me up so much, because I grew up with a lot of material possessions, money, and a seemingly super involved mother. When people think of bad childhoods, they think of poverty, physical abuse, druggie parents, things like that. Maybe I’m a spoiled brat.

,depression,"No longer have any passion for my interests, or even any passion for life tbh. Im lonely af, feel worthless and hopeless. I dont want to kill myself though my mind tells me i do. But id much rather be happy, thrive and prosper. Its strange for sure. I'd like to say im a hard worker, im intuitive and a problem solver. There's things i aspire to do, and know im phyiscally and mentally capable of doing in one part of my mind. 

The other part that's always lurking is telling me im a worthless piece of shit and cant do anything and that even if i was successful still nobody would care so whats the point. Recently ive been losing the battle with that other part, and when my mind tries to rationalise my life situation (which isnt even that bad) and thoughts, the conclusion it comes to, is self termination.

Wanting to die or kill yourself is not a rational thought. Theres nothing rational at all about poor mental health. I think it has helped me a lot understanding the science a lil bit.

,depression,"Hey, I'm in a 14 year old female (9th grade), and right now I'm in a low point in my life ( no I am not one of those im14andthisisdeep girls haha). At the moment I really don't want to discuss everything yet, but there is this one situation I do.

ALSO please mind that I am bad at expressing myself, so this may sound repetitive.

I'll try to list everything...

My friend group consists of around 9 people (I think, it keeps adding up, and I'll explain later). There is this girl in my ""friend group"" (can't really say 'friends"" because I am not really close to them) who keeps avoiding me. She started to avoid me around the start of the school year. She started show her dislike around me when my friends were talking jokingly, (I can't recall properly, sorry) that if they were not going to receive any flowers in Valentines Day, hence saying some people in my friend group do, they would group up and watch a movie together. I was curious, so I asked something related to it (sorry, can't remember exactly :(, I think I said something like ""Oh! What movie?"" or ""When?"" (like when would this event take place) ). She then rudely replies with ""Who are YOU!?"". This other girl from my friend group just stared at me (Not in a rude way, but in a way I can't read her expression) I was kind of hurt then.

This behaviour kept continuing. Around a few days later, I went to the spot where my friends sat, and sat next to the girl who apparently dislikes me. She IMMEDIATELY stood up and rushed (no kidding, she ran away from me) to the opposite side, and sat there. I just blankly stared at her, again hurt the frick for me. The group stayed silent, then same girl who looked at me then said ""Oh, I know why"".

Because of this, I was in a shit mood. The shittiest mood I've been compared to the whole day. I was walking to my HSIE class (where 2 of my other ""friends"" were in). I asked one of them, (for her privacy, I'll call her ""Sally"") why (let's call her Fiona) keeps avoiding me. Sally replies saying I said something to Fiona *A FEW MONTHS AGO* that pissed her off. Sally then tells me to not worry, and that Fiona is a *""petty person""* . (Honestly, I thought okay, wtf? I actually was actually tearing up a bit due to sadness, not to the extent of crying though)

Timeskip to a few days, (with Fiona going to the opposite side of the friend circle *As AlWaYs!1!,* and with me now, I try no to be near her, but even being the slight nearest, she goes even further away). I asked someone who was friends/close to Fiona while going out of my commerce class to the next period. I explained the situation to her (*whilst clinging to the edge of the wall like that Yandere girl from Yandere simulator because I am awkward af, seriously*). She also responds to something similar. She said Fiano used to act up like that to her and I just need to get used to it. (I was tearing up AgAin (not to the extend to cry) \*le fucking sigh\*). She then adds ""Oh, you don't like it?"". She then says something similar that Sally said before ""She is just petty"" (ugh so tired of hearing that word from everyone).

Timeskip\~\~

She keeps avoiding me, not sitting next to me. Recently I was going to the bathroom with another girl, whilst walking back to class, Fiona responds ""Hey -name-"" and ignores me (wow, how nice...). When I talk, she glares at me. And more, more, MORE negative reactions to me.

Today, I had HSIE class after lunch. I was 'complaining' (not in an annoying way) about how boring it was. And then fucking Piano responds with ""Maybe if you had friends"".

I pause, literally a flash of emotions hit me: hurtfulness, pain, frustration, anger, you name it. I had just enough with her play and said something around (maybe I should of responded differently, more direct? and not nicely?) ""Why do you hate me, whatever you did, just tell me, I will say sorry"" and blah blah blah. (Sorry, I only started to notice I was too kind this year, and that it lead to me being hurt, and people taking the advantage to go on top of me (yeah, there are a few girls, again? why would you hate me?, who dislike me. I won't talk about it because this thread would be WAYYY too long) ).

Fiona then replies with ""Nothing/No you did nothing wrong. \*I just hate you."" .\*I was spreading in a bad mood. Bad morning, had a maths test, didn't sleep because I was staying up studying and also extremely VERY stressed!

The group went silent, stopped talking. I had enough, I don't want to be apart of the group (explain later). I don't want to be near HER. I. fucking.had.enough. I abruptly left the group (sorry, should've mentioned earlier, but I do that more and more often when she does something shitty to me) and walked around, staring at happy (I mean I don't really know) people with their friends, fake smiling.(ugh for some reason I approached some closely just to stare at them.

Ugh fucking amazing life.

Also I will talk about my friends now.

They weren't a fixed group, especially around 8th grade. You know when there is a new student, and the teacher would just ~~force~~ put them in your group? Well, welcome to mine!

Anyways, my group is basically where new people come. There has been 1 from 8th grade (never met her before) and an old friend who came back(left). There would be another girl who would hang out in my group and another one (that one more now). This year, 9th grade, already on our 6th week, 2 girls were introduced (I don't even remember their names).

There are certain things that creates a friend group. For example, if you like books, you stay with bookworms (the ""bookworm group""). Because of this (tho, nothing like that made me feel close to my friends), my friends group isn't so closely connected to one another. Like lunch is so fucking boring now. When was the last time I had fun during recess or lunch?(Note\_ 4 out of 5 days I have school meetings on lunch, just SRC things!) Now people just eat due to boredom, and half of them go on their phones. No (little) interactions created. I am quiet, but not the most quiet in the group, now I am. When they talk, they laugh, I don't.

But seriously, I never felt close to my friends, they would go to parties, parks, movies with each other, where am I? at home. They had photos posted on instagram one time of them in a party. They tagged each other, not including ME (only one, thanks. Btw not close to her though). They printed photo cards of those pictures and shared them to each other as memory (some are on their phone case). One picture was the korean hand heart (that saranghaeyo thingy) they made together as a circle. (Wow, like that didn't;t hurt)

Im not close to them, I feel lonely being around them, and I have no one to talk to, no one to trust. Where do I go now? How do I make friends? Because of this, I've reached out bout my loneliness online (in a few different platforms) to talk to. It's nicer to talk to someone online though.. They don't know me and keep this secret...

Sorry, this was longer than I thought. There is more I want to talk about (I never thought something that I thought was small would end up being this long). I may post some more in the future.

If there is something you want me to elaborate on, please feel free to ask! (But I won't respond if it is too personal hehe).

,depression,"Warning: this is VERY long. I'm not sure what the purpose of it really is but just wanting to put this out there in the world. Maybe I'll get some advice, maybe someone will read it and realize they are not alone.

I’ve started writing this so many times and lost motivation half way through. This is yet another attempt, let’s see what happens.

I’m a 30 year old woman, I work as a photographer for a fashion company with a degree in Graphic Design, volunteer at a cat rescue 2 days a week, and suffer from depression and social/general anxiety disorder.

I first realized my teen angst wasn’t just a “phase” sometime in my early 20’s. As a teenager I would do the normal things: drink, do drugs, smoke weed. I would also write a lot but this writing, in hindsight, was some of the deepest cries for help. I’ve since lost that precious notebook, but I did come upon snippets of that “poetry” in my other sketchbooks. The stuff wasn’t anything out of the ordinary - I grew up listening to emo and other such heart wrenching music - and the style was really just lyrics trying to artistically describe the dark cloud that was inside of me every minute of every day. I lost interest in that activity around the age of 20.

I was always a shy person. I played with friends during school, but I was never allowed to have anyone over or go to anyone’s house. As a result, I was always found by myself in the yard skipping rope alone. My parents brought me to Canada when I was 9 years old in order to expand my options for education. I was born in Russia where there wasn’t much choice at the time to do anything with your life other than engineering, medicine or teaching. In that aspect, I thank them. I was able to attend an art school in Toronto and attain my Graphic Design degree which my anxious artistic brain appreciates.

When I arrived in Canada I didn’t speak much English and was in an ESL program. In that first year, 4th grade, I was bullied for not speaking the language. Some girls quickly realized that it would be fun to put rocks (the little pebbles from the playground) down my pants while we had “carpet time” (when all the kids gather around crossed legged on the floor in front of the teacher during a lesson.) They knew I wouldn’t say anything, partly because I couldn’t physically, partly because I couldn’t mentally. Kids would kick my chair constantly as they walked by, someone even throw things at me from the back. I brushed it off, went on with it. I did have two great friends (one of which is still in my life albeit we aren’t close.)

This childish bullying subsided after the first year. I went off to another school in grade 5 after moving buildings with my parents. 6th grade was split. It was yet another school (moving from elementary to middle school) and then half way through 6th grade, after establishing quite a solid group of new friends, I was transferred to a new school after yet another move by my parents. I had to start over with the friend thing and luckily I befriended a girl right away. She was also an outcast, being extremely tiny and skinny for her age and also didn’t fit in with the “cool popular kids.” Here I was laughed and looked down upon for being new, having 1 friend, and being so extremely shy. After a while I became close with another girl, let’s call her Jessica. 7th grade went by bearably with her around, outside minor incidents like having the basketball thrown at my head during recess. I was also developing extremely bad acne, so I was doomed to be the ugly shy girl for the next few years.

Ending of 8th grade is where the real trouble started with Jessica. She had an “in” with the cooler kids in the grade and being so attached to her, I got to hang out with the group occasionally. This is where we started “relationships” with two boys. She was with lets call him Andrew and I was with let’s call him Mike. We would hang out after school a lot and one day I brought them all over to my house. Mike took me down to my parent’s cellar at one point and where I thought I would have my first kiss, my hands were forced down onto his penis. I didn’t know how to retaliate so I went with it. Instead of a first kiss, I gave my first hand job. The next time we hung out was at the movies. I was brought to the bathroom for what I thought was a make out session but turned out to be an attempt at a blow job. I can’t remember whether I went through with it, I just remember crying that evening. I soon found out that Andrew and Mike had a bet going of who would get their dick sucked first and Jessica agreed to bring me into the group so they could use me for that bet. These things bled into high school. The rumours started that I was a slut and were reinforced with photos being distributed throughout the school. The photos were of me wearing see through mesh pants in provocative poses that Jessica took of me in her room one night when we were having a fun “fashion” night. She wore them too, although somehow the photos of her never got distributed. 

Finally a new girl came to the school lets call her Beth and finally things seemed to calm down. We had a great friendship going and were inseparable during high school (to the point where people were calling us lesbians.) I even attended her wedding two years ago, she’s a beautiful human being. I tried my best to have a normal life. I threw myself into art. I would come to school at 7 in the morning so spend time in the photography dark room lab. I got great marks in my classes and my teachers loved me. Of course throughout this time I did the regular teenage girl stuff. I liked boys, I would make out with them. I was already well trained in the hand job department so guys learned to hand me over to their friends once they were done with me. I just did it. It made them happy. And in my mind, that made me good at it. Why not do the thing that I felt I excelled at? Of course none of that behaviour helped the growing rumours. 

I first tried drugs in 10th grade. Beth and I would skip school, pop ecstasy, spend the day together. This went on for about a year in the 11th grade where my marks drastically plummeted. I’m not sure what the triggering factor for me to stop was, but I managed to graduate high school on the honour roll. At the end of 12th grade I met lets call him Sam. We dated for 2 years, I lost my virginity to him, but I will always remember doubting his intentions. Did he stay with me for the sex? Did he only want me around because I would smoke weed with him? It didn’t matter. I lost romantic interest in him after a year but stayed together despite us fighting because it was comfortable and a habit I just didn’t want to, or couldn’t break.

I got into my top school of choice and spent the first year working hard. After my break up with Sam, I met lets call him Dale. It was interesting at first. He would show up at my work almost daily and chat and finally we started going on real dates. He brought me gifts and showered with me with attention. I now realize that it was borderline stalker behaviour. He wouldn’t take no for an answer even if I didn’t really feel like doing anything. The thing with Dale is kind of an on and off ordeal. We were never fully together but would hang out often usually drinking or going on drives. I was starting to get really put off by him, but one night he insisted on hanging out. As you well know by now, I have trouble saying no. So we went to the bar, got a buzz going and then went driving. (I know how shameful it is to drink and I drive. I know first hand because I almost killed my friend during a drunk driving episode. I haven’t done it since and will never do it again.) We were in the car and I was completely insistent that this was a non sexual meet up. But he wouldn’t stop trying to kiss me, to push my hands on to his crotch, then pushing my head down, asking me to just suck it a little. I did it just to make him shut up so I could go home. I haven’t seem him since them. I refused to talk to him and eventually had to block him. To this day he tries to make attempts at communication but nothing dangerous. 

The truly destructive behaviour started around 22 when I began to frequent parties. At first it was drinking, and a lot of it. Then I met a 28 year old man lets call him Izack. He was a DJ and very much into the rave party scene. It was with him when I tried coke for the first time at the age of 23 or 24. Lets just call the rest a blur. I would party twice a week, heavily on drugs, go to school completely hung over. Long story short, I just managed to graduate, scraping by with a warning letter and passing marks given to me probably only out of the kindness of my professor’s heart. I loved Izack. He was older, had more experience, best sex I’ve ever had and he made me forget everything and everyone. He lived downtown in an apartment with two other roommates who also loved to party and we all got along quite well. The sanctuary of that apartment was heavenly. I would be able to spend all my time there away from my strict Russian parents. Then Izack started going on the road a lot more due to his DJ career flourishing. When he was away, I would come to his place and clean everything. I bought him a huge new TV for his room. I wanted him to come home to a beautiful place. In my mind that was me saying thank you for letting me stay with him rent free for so many days of the week. 

About a year into our relationship, I went for a gynaecologist check up which was followed by a phone call saying that I have an STD. They told me to get myself and my partner into the office so we could be given medication. It was nothing overly serious, cleared up with a few pills but I had to have a serious conversation with Izack. He swore on his life that he never cheated on me. He begged me to believe him which after hours upon hours of me crying and pleading, I finally did. But I never got over the nagging feeling that something wasn’t right. So after a month of uncertainty, over the phone on my birthday (I remember that day so clearly), I asked him one more time. I’m not sure what made him tell me truth this time around, but yes, of course he slept with someone on tour and yes that is how I contracted the STD.

I was a complete and utter wreck for the next few months. The drugs and alcohol increased. I went on Tinder and began my first sex binge. At one point I managed to sleep with 6 different men in one week. All I wanted to do was to forget the hurt and I didn’t know how. Again, all of this is very blurry so I can’t say the exact moment that Izack came back into my life but he did. I remember going to a bar to meet him to get closure, to finally say I forgive him and that I’m moving on. That meeting ended up with me in his apartment and sex. We then got “back together”, continued the destructive behaviour until his next tour where he slept with someone again. I let that one go easily since we never stated that we were officially a couple again. I think this is where I learned how to numb my brain from hurt. I wasn’t mad at him anymore, I just quietly walked away and threw myself into my second huge sex binge on Tinder. After a few months of this, I met a guy lets call him Jon. 

We dated for something close to a year. This relationship was also fuelled by alcohol, drugs and parties. But at this point I didn’t want another life. The relationship involved me crying almost every day at work with something abusive he may have said to me that day. For example, he loved to make me feel like an idiot for asking him why it took him hours to answer a text massage. I was told I was crazy on an almost daily basis. I will fast forward to the end, where a girl (who is now a friend) reached out to me saying that she was also dating Jon, for 6 months now. She spotted us at a party kissing, and lost her mind. Apparently she had no knowledge of me for the long while they were together. It turns out, that we weren’t the only ones. I came to the knowledge that he had slept with 8 different people during the span of being with me. This included his upstairs neighbour who I was constantly told not to worry about. 

I laughed at this. I didn’t cry, I didn’t feel angry, I laughed, pulled out my phone and on to the next Tinder binge I went.

It took me about 6 months to get into my next relationship. This one was with a kind man who would never do a thing to hurt me. It lasted for about 2 years. I met his parents and he met mine. We were talking about marriage and moving in together but it ended up falling apart during our search for an apartment. We just weren’t right for each other.

So this is where I am now. 30 years old, living back with my parents. I have since stopped the partying because that life doesn’t satisfy me anymore and my body can’t handle it. I have been coke free for about a year now mainly because I can’t afford it. But I drink. I drink several times a week because I can’t stand my job. I drink because I feel trapped in my own mind. I drink because of my living situation. I drink because nothing I do excites me. I drink about 3 times a week and once I crack a bottle of wine, there is no way I can stop. That bottle is getting drunk to the last drop and more often than not, a second one gets opened and lasts about half way until I pass out. 

The job thing - realized I’m the only one who can help myself there so I have been taking lots of photos and editing them in an effort to update my portfolio but sitting down and editing those photos sober just isn’t an option. I go to work, I laugh with my coworkers, but at the end of the day, the only thing that makes me happy and that I took forward to is that next drink. I started exercising and have been continuing to do so pretty consistently but I always fall off the boat because I can’t stay excited and motivated. 

Last night I came home to my collection of wine bottles all out and displayed in front of me by my dad. My mom discovered the first bottle in my closet when she couldn’t find my cat, or so she says. She then proceeded to go through every crevice of my room and pulled out the 20 or so I had hidden. Long story short, my life of drinking after work and during my own photo editing hours is over and I am terrified. I feel like I have nothing happy to come home to. I spent all last night crying and today is the first day I didn’t show up to work because of this. The thing is - I don’t know if I want to stop. I’ve had thoughts of suicide since my early teenage years and they have never gone away. I’ve cut myself on numerous occasions. I have dabbled with the idea of overdosing on my anxiety and depression medication. I did go into therapy for a few months but that turned out way too pricey for my minimal salary. My dad has offered to pay for my therapy last night, but this is an offer I’m not sure I want to take. I just want it to be over. The only times things are okay in my brain is when I am sleeping, or when I am heavily buzzed. I don’t have children, nor a boyfriend and I have maybe 2 friends, so I’m finding it difficult to see a purpose to go on. 

I would like to finish by saying how awful I feel about putting this out there. The amount of times the word “I” is used is upsetting and selfish since I know there are people out there who have it way worse than me. Like my parents have pointed out numerous times, I have nothing to be sad about. I have a good job, a warm house, food and water. I have a car that my dad so kindly gave to me when he bought himself a new one. And they are right. I have it so good. But inside, that dark cloud just won’t lift and there is no way I can describe it in words to someone who hasn’t felt the pull of it.

I go to work, I laugh with my coworkers, but at the end of the day, the only thing that makes me happy and that I took forward to is that next drink. I started exercising and have been continuing to do so pretty consistently but I always fall off the boat because I can’t stay excited and motivated. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Last night I came home to my collection of wine bottles all out and displayed in front of me by my dad. My mom discovered the first bottle in my closet when she couldn’t find my cat, or so she says. She then proceeded to go through every crevice of my room and pulled out the 20 or so I had hidden. Long story short, my life of drinking after work and during my own photo editing hours is over and I am terrified. I feel like I have nothing happy to come home to. I spent all last night crying and today is the first day I didn’t show up to work because of this. The thing is - I don’t know if I want to stop. I’ve had thoughts of suicide since my early teenage years and they have never gone away. I’ve cut myself on numerous occasions. I have dabbled with the idea of overdosing on my anxiety and depression medication. I did go into therapy for a few months but that turned out way too pricey for my minimal salary. My dad has offered to pay for my therapy last night, but this is an offer I’m not sure I want to take. I just want it to be over. The only times things are okay in my brain is when I am sleeping, or when I am heavily buzzed. I don’t have children, nor a boyfriend and I have maybe 2 friends, so I’m finding it difficult to see a purpose to go on. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I would like to finish by saying how awful I feel about putting this out there. The amount of times the word “I” is used is upsetting and selfish since I know there are people out there who have it way worse than me. Like my parents have pointed out numerous times, I have nothing to be sad about. I have a good job, a warm house, food and water. I have a car that my dad so kindly gave to me when he bought himself a new one. And they are right. I have it so good. But inside, that dark cloud just won’t lift and there is no way I can describe it in words to someone who hasn’t felt the pull of it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thank you, from the bottom of my heart to anyone who read this fully, attempted to read it, or even glanced at it. I am very scared and for some reason the only thing I thought of this morning was writing this.&lt;/p&gt;

Over the last couple of years here anxiety has worsened and over the last few months it's just too much for me, we don't see anybody anymore, if we do she has a panic attack before it and i've ended up having to cancel plans. It's our nieces third birthday party tomorrow and we were supposed to be going to stay up at my parents for the weekend and she doesn't want go.

She's not from here so has no family or friends here who aren't mine so she really feels like she has nobody else but I'm exhausted. I can ask her family and friends from back home to talk to her but she doesn't want me to tell anyone. She believes she is just in the way and makes everyone's life shit, I try and tell her it's not true but it's so deep rooted into her mind that she just think she'd be better off dead, she's threatened suicide before so I feel like if I leave her even for this weekend she would kill herself as it's not really a threat but just her mindset of thinking she's better off dead. Idk anymore, I really don't. I don't even know if this is just kme being an asshole i'm just lost and confused and tired. I still love her but she just doesn't care about life anymore.

She stopped taking medication about a year ago as she thought it was making it worse, I respected her wishes and tbh, sometimes it seemed fine but lately it's absolutely not fine and she refuses to go back on any form of medication.

,depression,"Hello everyone! I, as well as most people on the subreddit, have depression. I've been struggling with it for a few years. Recently I was prescribed with welbutrin. I must say that I cant express how much better I've been doing. I still have my moments at night but it's definitely not as bad. I've been struggling with my weight for a while as well but I was just laying in bed and had a weird switch get flipped and now I want to change my diet, i want to start going to the gym and be active. It's crazy because I'm lazy as fuck. Maybe doing this will help a lot with my depression. 

I'm scared though because a few years ago I broke my back while playing football. I was really active outdoors. I played football for the school, I kayaked, hiked, etc. Not being able to do those things has caused me to gain a bunch if weight and become insanely depressed. I lost feeling in my toes for 6 months after the initial accident. I wasn't able to do anything active. My toes are fine now but the fact that I'm not able to do what I used to do because of the accident has caused me to be depressed. I dont want to be depressed anymore, I'm sure everyone can relate. I want to get my life back the way it was and the only way I can do it is to step out of my comfort zone and find someone who will be willing to help me achieve my goal. 

Although it may be difficult, I know if I try my hardest I can achieve my goal. I apologize for the rant but this sudden change in my mindset has got me really motivated and honestly a bit emotional. I was scared I'd never find a way out of this rut. I'm also scared to lose this motivation. I dont want this to be a small fluke of motivation and then tomorrow I'm right back at where I was.

I will frame unnecessary explanations with ""//"", in case anyone reading wants to skip. Although I'd like to warn you that this post is somewhat long regardless, as I like to explain things.

I've been considering myself unworthy (of a real friend, of feeling better, of complaining) since a long time, as I have a nice life, or because that I'm not feeling as bad as many other people who are said to be depressed. I obviously never wanted to be sad, nor to experience bad things, but I wanted to be worthy of some certain things I felt I needed. Over time I began feeling worse and worse, to a point where I compare myself more than I used to do, where almost everything upsets me. 

//For example, let's say there is a character I relate to and am happy about being alike. That used to be a source of motivation. Now when I see this character, I can only think of how much better this said persona is compared to myself, and how I can never be like them. When I look at something I value, rather than being happy I feel worried of what might happen to them. Or, when entering a new season I mourn the previous, alongside all the time I wasted.//

I'm mostly worried, stressed, or sad. The thing is that there is no clear reason for me to feel so. I sometimes question if I myself feel that way..



I also am having a hard time figuring my feelings for over a year. There are some occasions where I thought I didn't feel anything, but couldn't help crying.

The reason I'm writing this post is that, while watching a show, a character explained a 'negative' habit of the other, which I ultimately related to. It's not something I consider to be really bad. However, after that scene I couldn't somehow focus to the episode. My interest faded to a point. It was almost as if I was reacting to what was said, but I don't even care that much. The character cared, but not me. Was I impersonating his emotions? Or am I just faking all these to feel worthy? I cannot understand this. Am I really sad or am I just kidding myself?

I can barely read my own feelings, beliefs, and thoughts at this point. Like, I still know what they are, but I can't feel that.

,depression,"I don't know if this is the right place to post about this, but I thought I would give it a shot.

I've been an artist my whole life, ever since I can remember. I went through many years of art school, and while studying I was doing well. Art has been synonymous with my identity forever, and I've always wanted to be an artist more than anything else.

But I've also had mental health issues my entire life, and I've gone through a couple of periods of terrible depression in the past. I've been medicated since I was a child, so that's helped most of the time. But now, starting last autumn, I've gone into a depressive period that's a bit different than the previous ones. 

I think a combination of my medication losing efficacy and experiencing an artistic burnout are the reasons for this depression. I did two solo shows recently and have been pushing myself to draw so much, so I think burnout is very likely. In any case, I started to notice that I didn't enjoy drawing anymore.

Drawing became a terrible, dreaded chore. It started to feel like way too much work - and that work was not interesting or exciting. The work was also difficult and just SO much. SO many lines. Honestly, when I think about drawing I start to feel physically unwell. 

I've been advised to take a break from drawing, and I'm doing so. I haven't actually drawn anything for about a couple of weeks, and I'm going for one month. 

I'm just so terrified that I'll never enjoy drawing again. I can't even remember what it feels like to not hate drawing. But I still want to be an artist so much. Plus, I honestly don't have any other hobbies unrelated to art that I could focus on. Nothing else really interests me.

I should also mention that I'm switching medications right now, and I'm about to go onto a full dose of my new medication (which is actually one that's worked for me in the past).

,depression,"  

The thoughts of a 30-year-old depressed guy. I am afraid of, well not afraid but the things I think about on a regular basis. I worry if my daughter will be taken away from because of my crazy ex-wife. I worry about what my daughter thinks or will think of me because I have no goals or ambitions right now other than to make enough money to outshine my ex-wife. I want to do all these things, but I am too worried about everything that will go wrong with them. I want to start a business and be successful, but I am afraid of failure and getting stuck right back where I am, which is like resetting my whole life. I worry about if I am going to get cancer because I am addicted to chewing tobacco and want to stop for my daughters sake because I don’t want it to influence her life because I have been told it is bad for you. I worry about being alone the rest of my life because I can’t seem to find anyone who loves me or is it because I am to shallow and don’t think anyone over 150 lbs. is pretty. I can’t sleep because my mind races and races at night and these things flow through my mind. I worry about looking successful to the people around me which holds me back because I don’t want to show how unsuccessful I am right now. I feel like a failure and a worthless person. the only thing that gets me through the really really tough thoughts is my daughter. And if I wasn’t here who would raise her. The pressure around me to do the right thing is tremendous but what is the right thing? Is the right thing what everyone thinks or what is socially acceptable? Is the right thing what I think is right? but then why do other people think some of the things I do are wrong? What makes them right? I think about the things in my past that I could have done differently but what’s the point? I can’t change them so why do I dwell on them? Do I need to even worry about them? I worry about how I am going to pay for things if I lose my VA disability but I don’t want to go to my VA appointments because I feel it reinforces the fact that I am messed up and I come up with excuses as to why I shouldn’t go. to try to reason with myself as to why its ok not to go. It’s also a distance away which wastes 2 hours of my days sitting at home doing nothing. So is it helpful to go to an appointment and lie to a doc for 15 mins telling him that every things ok and I take meds, Which I don’t take my meds because 1 I hate taking medication every day and 2 I don’t like to think taking them helps but they do because if I took them then I might not be writing this. I know I need to do better but I work at a dead-end job that has no future for me. I am just a pawn in someone else’s business story. I want to make more money, but I don’t know where to go because no one is telling me where to go and I am afraid to start anything just to fail. I don’t want to waste my time doing something and have that time taken from me by an unforeseen event. But why do I worry about an unforeseen event when I can’t even see it coming. Is my life that messed up that I am worried about something that may or may not happen. I sit here typing this looking into my baby monitor telling myself I need to do better for my daughter. What example am I setting for her if I don’t do anything with my life. I thought I had my whole life planned out then boom my world is rocked by an unhealthy relationship which everyone but me saw. Everyone told me I shouldn’t have been with that girl. Everyone told me I needed to leave her. But as cliché (why did I just look up how to spell cliché in something I am only going to read) as it sounds, I loved her. Or at least what I thought was love. I was ready to spend my life with her, but she went and fucked two other people and who knows how many others. But blamed me because she thought I had an affair…. Which I didn’t have an affair. I write this hoping my feelings will leave my body and I will not worry about them anymore. But for how long is it going to last? Is this really going to help? Maybe I’ll post this on some reddit website and become famous for it. Ha who am I kidding. I am nobody. I am a middle age man who has been handed a fucked-up life and can’t get out. But it’s not as fucked up as some people’s lives so why does mine hurt so bad? Maybe I am stuck on the materialistic things and want to hide behind them. Like having a nice truck but not as nice as the one I want because I am smart enough not to burry myself in debt and have that looming over me. I am content on doing nothing but am afraid of everything. I tell myself I am meant for more, but I don’t know how to get there. I am smart but not smart enough to figure out how to make myself happy. So, am I really that smart? I can tell you all night and day that I am smarter than what I am doing right now but have nothing to show for it. I think everyone is out to get me in some way shape or form, I don’t trust anyone, I think they all have some agenda to serve themselves but don’t we all. Is anyone truly selfless? Now I am just rambling to ramble so focus, focus on why I am writing this. Focus focus focus why why am I handed a dealt of cards that has no instructions? is that life? What’s the purpose? Why do I even waste my time? Why can’t I win the lottery and hide behind the money at least I will be able to do the things that make me happy because I won’t be constrained by money? But if I did have it would I really be HAPPY? I think it would be better than where I am. But why would I be so lucky as to win the lottery when there are stronger people out there who deserve it more than me? is luck a figment of our imaginations? are all the strings being pulled by some divine or supreme power? Some might say I am on drugs right now to think like this. I’m not. This is how my mind works and I think it’s a blessing and a curse. Who will even read this? Now it’s just becoming to long for the quick reader to think it’s interesting and too short for anyone to take it seriously but I’m not writing it for them I am writing it for myself. I want to get better I want to do better. But where are the answers? Do I make up the answers and hope I get by? Do I tell lies and belittle other people to get through life? Why not? It feels like other people, all people do it to me. Who is coming to punish those who do me wrong? Do I do it? No, why? because I am afraid of the consequences. I am pressured by everyone to do the right thing. Maybe that’s what governs people? Then why doesn’t everyone act the same? Are there to many questions in this? Who cares? Its mine right, maybe I will share this so someone can laugh, someone can feel empowered to do the same? Someone can belittle me? I need to do better I need to push myself to do better. I started working out because I thought I might get laid if I look better. But is anyone even going to notice? I wasn’t in shape before and got laid, sort of… I more or less have always found the girl who is in need and made her feel better, then when that wears off, I am alone… am I going to be alone for the rest of my life? At least I have my daughter, right? But eventually she will leave me too because no one wants to be around someone as depressed as me… I wouldn’t want to be around me. I always hear this saying on the radio or tv or what have you “ you have to love yourself before anyone can love you”… who am I kidding I will always be alone because I don’t see myself loving myself. I am fat, ugly and stupid. I don’t have any value. I don’t have the ability to love anyone else because I just want to use the other person to make myself feel better. But how is that? Does that even make sense? Am I connecting with anyone? If this is circulating around and you are reading this far, then possibly? Should I keep going? Maybe I still feel like going. My fingers are starting to hurt but it feels a little better to not have all these things bottled up inside me. Maybe it’s because I am pretending to type it to an imaginary audience. so, things I worry about. I worry about paying bills, but I am good at financial stuff. So that’s ok but I still worry about them. I worry that I am not doing the right thing. I worry about what other people think of me but that’s ridiculous. I should not worry about that right? I worry about the spelling in this, but I have spell check. I worry about sleeping all day when I have my daughter because she could hurt herself because she is 2. I also worry she is going to grow up and think I just slept all the time, but she doesn’t know I was up until 3am writing a stupid paper about the things I worry about. But that’s not her fault. I worry about making a good impression on the people around me because I don’t want to be alone and the only people around me is family right now. I seem to piss everyone else off. Why do I piss them off? Because I am pushing people away so they can’t hurt me. Is that an excuse? I worry about getting into an accident and not being able to take care of my responsibilities, but should I? I worry about being someone else’s burden, I don’t want to hinder someone else’s life with my inability to love myself. It is no one’s problem but my own. But there are people who want to help me or are they getting paid to do so because someone decided it was good for business to make money on others suffering. #cancer maybe that’s too much. I definitely can’t post this anywhere now. I worry about getting up in the morning and it being my last day. I worry that all of this will pile up and I’ll do something I can’t take back. But that’s why I think of my daughter, I worry I’ll be trapped in this life and these circumstances for a long time because I am too afraid to take a leap of faith and just try to make my life better. I worry about anything and everything. I don’t care about anyone other than my daughter truly, her life is the only real thing I care about. She is so innocent, am I contaminating her life by being in it though? Is my negative thinking rubbing off on her and will she be like me? I hope not. I see the negative in everything. I can’t think fast but when I do think at my own pace, I can figure shit out. I worry about being in a situation I can’t think my way out of. I truly worry about everything. My daughter is being pushed into school. Well I think so. Her mother doesn’t want her to not be in school, because she is ready. I think it’s because her mom doesn’t want to take care of her and wants to push her into school so someone else must deal with her. She seems too young to start preschool in my mind. Why do I care so much about what my ex-wife is doing or thinks? Maybe it is because I have to deal with her for the rest of my life, not like she is going away and I can’t not talk to her because then the court will see me as being unfit to parent then I will lose my daughter. I don’t want that now do I. I feel like my ex-wife has her life together and mine is falling apart underneath me but maybe she is just hiding it like I am trying to do? But I’m the one writing this so we will stick with my feelings. I don’t want to lose my daughter but everything I do I am feeling like it is a movement on a chess board and at any moment I am going to get check mated. Who even uses a term like that anymore? Apparently, I do. I worry about who is going to care for my daughter when I am not around. I worry she will fall into something and I can’t save her. Literally and figuratively. I worry my life is pointless then I think of her smile and watch videos of her, and it makes me happy. I worry I am a burden on people, and no one wants to deal with me, so I try to hide myself. I feel I am not good at anything. Or not good enough. I feel lonesome tired afraid and beaten down. I have to many struggles. too much on my mind. Emotionless. Defeated.

I am afraid of, well not afraid but the things I think about on a regular basis. I worry if my daughter will be taken away from because of my crazy ex-wife. I worry about what my daughter thinks or will think of me because I have no goals or ambitions right now other than to make enough money to outshine my ex-wife. I want to do all these things, but I am too worried about everything that will go wrong with them. I want to start a business and be successful, but I am afraid of failure and getting stuck right back where I am, which is like resetting my whole life. I worry about if I am going to get cancer because I am addicted to chewing tobacco and want to stop for my daughters sake because I don’t want it to influence her life because I have been told it is bad for you. I worry about being alone the rest of my life because I can’t seem to find anyone who loves me or is it because I am to shallow and don’t think anyone over 150 lbs. is pretty. I can’t sleep because my mind races and races at night and these things flow through my mind. I worry about looking successful to the people around me which holds me back because I don’t want to show how unsuccessful I am right now. I feel like a failure and a worthless person. the only thing that gets me through the really really tough thoughts is my daughter. And if I wasn’t here who would raise her. The pressure around me to do the right thing is tremendous but what is the right thing? Is the right thing what everyone thinks or what is socially acceptable? Is the right thing what I think is right? but then why do other people think some of the things I do are wrong? What makes them right? I think about the things in my past that I could have done differently but what’s the point? I can’t change them so why do I dwell on them? Do I need to even worry about them? I worry about how I am going to pay for things if I lose my VA disability but I don’t want to go to my VA appointments because I feel it reinforces the fact that I am messed up and I come up with excuses as to why I shouldn’t go. to try to reason with myself as to why its ok not to go. It’s also a distance away which wastes 2 hours of my days sitting at home doing nothing. So is it helpful to go to an appointment and lie to a doc for 15 mins telling him that every things ok and I take meds, Which I don’t take my meds because 1 I hate taking medication every day and 2 I don’t like to think taking them helps but they do because if I took them then I might not be writing this. I know I need to do better but I work at a dead-end job that has no future for me. I am just a pawn in someone else’s business story. I want to make more money, but I don’t know where to go because no one is telling me where to go and I am afraid to start anything just to fail. I don’t want to waste my time doing something and have that time taken from me by an unforeseen event. But why do I worry about an unforeseen event when I can’t even see it coming. Is my life that messed up that I am worried about something that may or may not happen. I sit here typing this looking into my baby monitor telling myself I need to do better for my daughter. What example am I setting for her if I don’t do anything with my life. I thought I had my whole life planned out then boom my world is rocked by an unhealthy relationship which everyone but me saw. Everyone told me I shouldn’t have been with that girl. Everyone told me I needed to leave her. But as cliché (why did I just look up how to spell cliché in something I am only going to read) as it sounds, I loved her. Or at least what I thought was love. I was ready to spend my life with her, but she went and fucked two other people and who knows how many others. But blamed me because she thought I had an affair…. Which I didn’t have an affair. I write this hoping my feelings will leave my body and I will not worry about them anymore. But for how long is it going to last? Is this really going to help? Maybe I’ll post this on some reddit website and become famous for it. Ha who am I kidding. I am nobody. I am a middle age man who has been handed a fucked-up life and can’t get out. But it’s not as fucked up as some people’s lives so why does mine hurt so bad? Maybe I am stuck on the materialistic things and want to hide behind them. Like having a nice truck but not as nice as the one I want because I am smart enough not to burry myself in debt and have that looming over me. I am content on doing nothing but am afraid of everything. I tell myself I am meant for more, but I don’t know how to get there. I am smart but not smart enough to figure out how to make myself happy. So, am I really that smart? I can tell you all night and day that I am smarter than what I am doing right now but have nothing to show for it. I think everyone is out to get me in some way shape or form, I don’t trust anyone, I think they all have some agenda to serve themselves but don’t we all. Is anyone truly selfless? Now I am just rambling to ramble so focus, focus on why I am writing this. Focus focus focus why why am I handed a dealt of cards that has no instructions? is that life? What’s the purpose? Why do I even waste my time? Why can’t I win the lottery and hide behind the money at least I will be able to do the things that make me happy because I won’t be constrained by money? But if I did have it would I really be HAPPY? I think it would be better than where I am. But why would I be so lucky as to win the lottery when there are stronger people out there who deserve it more than me? is luck a figment of our imaginations? are all the strings being pulled by some divine or supreme power? Some might say I am on drugs right now to think like this. I’m not. This is how my mind works and I think it’s a blessing and a curse. Who will even read this? Now it’s just becoming to long for the quick reader to think it’s interesting and too short for anyone to take it seriously but I’m not writing it for them I am writing it for myself.

Still putting all my trust into one person just to be let down. Just to come to the harsh realization that they are human too, they make mistakes too. I know, I know… Everyone fucks up, but why does it feel like the world is ending when the people that mean the most to me fall short of my unrealistic expectations? Why do I feel ridiculously deceived? Surely I am their whole entire life, surely their world revolves around me. Why do I get stuck with these insecure, unsure thoughts rolling and crashing in my head. Surely it’s your fault, of course. I mean you were supposed to be the only man that never left. You were supposed to be the one that held me when I was let down. You were supposed to show me that I deserve more than what my taste lusts for. I’m sorry you never had that either. I’m sorry no one ever showed you right from wrong and I’m sorry no one held you when your heart was broken. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I just don’t know what to do now. I keep trying to stay in a rational state of mind and stray away from the path that was paved for me. It just so hard when I keep playing the victim.&lt;/p&gt;

,depression,"Hey guys. Last week, i went through the roughest day that ocd has ever thrown at me, which pushed me to finally tell my mom that I was going through severe anxiety (OCD) and I didn’t know what to do anymore.

I can’t walk down the street without worrying about whether or not I knocked someone over without realizing it, or bumped someone into the road without realizing it, or worrying about a rabid animal biting me without realizing it and dying from rabies, or worrying about stepping on a needle infected with HIV, or worrying about a homeless person infecting me with HIV/something worse without me realizing it.

I can’t drive without worrying about whether I hit a pedestrian without realizing it on that right turn, or that left turn, or if that green light was really green or did I just run a red light and run over a pedestrian crossing without realizing it?

I can’t get near moving water without worrying about the brain eating amoeba. If I get splashed in the face, Ill freak out internally for the rest of the day. I can’t eat food without worrying about it being poisoned or worrying about tapeworms.

I can’t have a basic conversation without worrying about whether something I say will come back to haunt me

I KNOW these things are stupid and will probably never happen, but my brain keeps on throwing me the “what if?” and I won’t be able to move on. I’ll even get physically affected by my anxiety- my eyes will burn and it will get harder to breathe

Anyway, my mom set up an appointment for a psychiatrist (I’m 18 and I’m still not smart enough/have enough money to set one up myself, I feel worthless already, pls don’t remind me) and I went there today.

The guy seemed like a good guy and everything, and made me sign paperwork as I was talking to him and everything, and everything was cool. On the way out, my mom asked the guy how much the bill would be, and he said it would be around 300 dollars for the first visit and around 150 for every visit after that.

I’ve been so upset ever since. I feel so bad. I told my mom I didn’t feel good going to a psychiatrist if it would be that expensive, but she’s super super supportive and insists on me getting help (she goes through anxiety too, to a lesser extent).

Then, my brain got the idea that what if the papers the guy made me sign was really a contract that would come back to haunt me later (ex-what if I signed away part of my future income,etc.) it sounds so stupid and it is. My brain just sees everything as a threat and is stuck in a perpetual fight or flight mode

Anyway, I don’t know what to do. I feel Iike for the past eight months I’ve just been a drain on my parents and everyone around me. All I am is a burden that can’t even make myself happy. I feel like if I don’t go to anymore appointments with this psychiatrist, I’ll have thrown away 300 bucks of my mom’s money for no reason, but if I do go to another appointment with him, I’ll cost her 150 a pop. I feel like I’m taking advantage of people and I feel like I’m too stupid to get my act together. I just want to be able to be happy again and have peace of mind. I’ve watched myself literally go nuts and I don’t know what to do anymore. To add to it, this is all in my head. I can’t even tell reality from obsession anymore.

Sometimes I feel like he just feels sorry for me.... sometimes I wonder if my friends really care..... if my family even cares.

I think my friends sometimes just think how annoying I am.

I swear I’m better off dead. I’m a burden.... nothing but a waste. 
Why am I here?
Why? 
I’m horrible at writing. Why do I try? I can’t draw for shit so I basically scribble and call it “art” 

I have tried so hard to become better at drawing.... I just can’t do it.

I try to have good and interesting stories.... they are shitty and predictable.

I don’t know where else to vent. I’m scared of judgment. I feel like I’m just lonely and attention seeking. I feel like a waste of space. I don’t understand why my boyfriend could love me when I don’t even love myself. I keep a lot of mental health stuff away from him because I’m scared of how he will react. The first time I self harmed I showed my ex and he got angry at me. I wish I never dated that asshole. I wish I never existed. I better off dead but too scared to die. I wish I could manage to starve but I can’t even do thAt right. 269 pounds. Fat ass. I am a fat ass failure who could never get a job. Can’t even stick to trying to learn French. I wanna die but like I said I’m too scared to. I can’t just depend on my boyfriend to keep me happy that’s selfish. He has his own problems. I try my best to listen when he wants to let some feelings out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sometimes I feel like he just feels sorry for me.... sometimes I wonder if my friends really care..... if my family even cares.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think my friends sometimes just think how annoying I am.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I swear I’m better off dead. I’m a burden.... nothing but a waste.

Why? 
I’m horrible at writing. Why do I try? I can’t draw for shit so I basically scribble and call it “art” &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have tried so hard to become better at drawing.... I just can’t do it.&lt;/p&gt;

,depression,"This is my own personal experiences not a how too or trying in any way to say my life is worse or the way I cope will help anyone else.

It has been a long journey, a fight every day, sometimes we win sometimes we loose.

Looking back 22 years ago, I was never formerly diagnosed with ADHD or Bipolar type 2 effective disorder, was never diagnosed officially as on the higher function autistic spectrum that all came much later.

The umbrella term seemed to be Reactive Depression relating to not only my Fathers death when I was 12 but my Girlfriend/Wife being diagnosed with incurable cancer at 21.

I spent the following 20 years fighting along side my Wife against this horrible illness that slowly destroyed her body until 20th November 2018 a double cardiac arrest with me standing next to her telling the doctors to stop because I knew she wasn't coming back. (her heart was a 14% functionality due to a silent heart attack 13 days beforehand caused by damage done via medication to keep the cancer away which also caused diabetes and kidney failure).

7 days after she died I was diagnosed with Bowel Cancer and spent that Christmas in hospital having 40% of my bowels removed (I have nodules on my lungs they are keeping an eye on).

Being in the same hospital as Paola died 6 weeks beforehand plus certain pain medication caused hallucinations and the beginning of my diagnosis of PTSD.

No family because my mum by this time was in a care home in late stages of early onset dementia.

It felt like the universe was just hitting me with punch after punch just to see how many times I could stand back up.

6 months on no one visiting so outside contact, I was on suicide watch and Samaritans help line actually called me weekly to see if I was still around, I had a plan to end my life, my logic boiling down to the following two points.

If I end my life and that is the end then I am in no more pain.

If I end my life and there is something after I am with Paola.

Had a plan, even down to writing a script that would send out emails to my Doctor and Psychologist so professionals found my body not my neighbors, my dogs had a forever home setup and I was visiting all the forums and communities saying goodbye to all the games me and Wife had played.

I was in a very dark place and the only light was an oncoming train which was either ""cancer comes back"" or ""A life without my best friend)

Everything was black and grey, nothing felt real to me and even when they told me 73% chance my bowel cancer wasn't coming back I couldn't smile and be happy.

**What changed ?**

One of the last places that I was going to visit was the game The Division, it had many good memories of us both exploring, shooting out windows, messing around, I did a walk through saying goodbye to my wife, and as I logged off an advertisement for The Division 2 came up and I thought to myself, ""lets see what mess they have made"" ""No reason to keep my money if I am going to end things"" So I bought the most expensive pack, downloaded it and logged on.

Something amazing happened, the next morning I wanted to log back on, I hadn't gamed since Paola had died, I hadn't interacted, talked or blown anything up.

A few days later I wrote a reddit post on that forum thanking the developers for saving my life.

The response was amazing and people started saying why don't you go on youtube, on twitch, why don't you talk about your experiences, mental health, cancer, diabetes, dialysis, heart disease, why don't you tell the world about how gaming helped you.

My response was ""what have I got to loose"", I watched my wife die, could anything anyone said about me making a fool of myself online ever come close to this.

I bought a mic, I bought a webcam, I did cooking videos, vlogs, streaming and those victories really helped me go from day to day.

I never missed a day at least 1 video every single day went up on youtube and twitch.

I have close to 500 followers on Youtube, close to 1000 on Twitch, others follow me on Facebook, Reddit and Mixer, I now multi stream to all 4 main places.

Am I still broken yes, I am classed as severely disabled, some days It takes me coming down stairs 3 times for me remembering to brush my teeth or do laundry.

I spend a lot of time in VR Beat Saber, SkyrimVr and others, Valve sent me a Valve index with no strings attached, after reading one of my posts (both me and Paola were involved in VR since 2016 due to her disabilities it was wonderful).

VR is an amazing tool for fighting depression, the complete immersion of being within a game be it a horror, a rhythm game (I have no rhythm), or fantasy, can help switch your mind to a world where life makes more sense.

My Senior Psychologist and 2 of my specialists have signed off on me all feeling that Gaming, VR and my Vlogging actually have given me a level of existence and a place to be.

,depression,"Over the past few months, my depression and social anxiety have spiraled out of control. At the end of my junior year of high school I had a really bad breakup and lost all my friends causing me to start self harming and isolating myself from everyone. Thankfully, this acquaintance I had took time out of his day to make music with me at lunch. It really meant a lot to me. He was the only friend I really had at the time. I had hung out with his friends a couple times before throughout high school, so I started playing video games with some of them. Eventually during the summer I got really close to them, and I became a part of their friend group. They really brought me out of that dark hole of depression, and I had never loved a group of friends more in my entire life. I had and still am going through extreme social anxiety, but helped me become more confident in myself and alleviated that a bunch. In the beginning of senior year I hung out with them after-school basically everyday, and it was the happiest I’d ever been. 

I don’t want to get into details but then something changed. A bunch of the group dynamics changed that made me felt inferior. I thought they thought I wasn’t as funny anymore, and was more weird and awkward. I reverted back to the state I was in with my previous girlfriend, and I started to worry incessantly that I would be abandoned by them. My mindset about the group also changed. I felt like I had to constantly meet their standards and entertain them or else they would abandon me. This has made socializing with them more of a grueling chore than a fun experience. I’ve isolated myself from them a lot, and I even feel a bit of anger towards them. 

There are these events that happen that make me feel like they think I’m weird, awkward, unfunny, and annoying, so I constantly try to change myself.

,depression,"Hi, I'm an eighth grader at a magnet school. I have ADD (attention deficit disorder), symptoms of depression, and I'm suicidal. For the past 3 years I've slowly been less and less motivated to do anything, even what I enjoy. I just want to go to sleep forever and forget about all the stress of school and a difficult social life. I get very stressed over school as the stakes go up, and my mom is constantly reminding me that I'll be a failure if I get too many B's. It doesn't help that my friends began ignoring me more and more when we started middle school with new, better people to hang out with than me. I'm treated like a tag-along now. My former best friends only talk to me and listen when they're bored and nobody else is there to talk to. I started having thoughts of suicide near the end of seventh grade, but it's really gotten worse this year as more is expected of me and my friends cast me further away. 
I decided to finally talk to someone this year, since my previous hints of needing help went unnoticed by my mom. On a day where I felt very low mentally, I told my mom I was suicidal. I broke down crying, and she hugged me. However, she said, ""Don't EVER even think about killing yourself. Do you know what that would do to me?"" I was a little upset about her reaction, as she seemed more concerned about herself. But I kept telling her more. I told her about how I thought I had depression, and she dismissed it as ""stress"" and said it would stop if i started to be positive. I was taken aback by this. I love my mother a lot, but she's never been good at giving advice or helping with my mental health. I got mad at her and began yelling about her never understanding or helping with my feelings.

I have ADD (attention deficit disorder), symptoms of depression, and I&amp;#39;m suicidal. For the past 3 years I&amp;#39;ve slowly been less and less motivated to do anything, even what I enjoy. I just want to go to sleep forever and forget about all the stress of school and a difficult social life. I get very stressed over school as the stakes go up, and my mom is constantly reminding me that I&amp;#39;ll be a failure if I get too many B&amp;#39;s. It doesn&amp;#39;t help that my friends began ignoring me more and more when we started middle school with new, better people to hang out with than me. I&amp;#39;m treated like a tag-along now. My former best friends only talk to me and listen when they&amp;#39;re bored and nobody else is there to talk to. I started having thoughts of suicide near the end of seventh grade, but it&amp;#39;s really gotten worse this year as more is expected of me and my friends cast me further away. 
I decided to finally talk to someone this year, since my previous hints of needing help went unnoticed by my mom. On a day where I felt very low mentally, I told my mom I was suicidal. I broke down crying, and she hugged me. However, she said, &amp;quot;Don&amp;#39;t EVER even think about killing yourself. Do you know what that would do to me?&amp;quot; I was a little upset about her reaction, as she seemed more concerned about herself. But I kept telling her more. I told her about how I thought I had depression, and she dismissed it as &amp;quot;stress&amp;quot; and said it would stop if i started to be positive. I was taken aback by this. I love my mother a lot, but she&amp;#39;s never been good at giving advice or helping with my mental health. I got mad at her and began yelling about her never understanding or helping with my feelings. I was a little too extreme, but the anger was not irrational. She yelled back something about her trying to help with the grief counselor (1. She didn&amp;#39;t help very much. 2.

So I had to call someone to come out and jump me. But it wouldn&amp;#39;t jump. So I had to spend money to get it towed. Then the damn mechanic shop jerked me around, and ended up fighting with them alot ( I use to be a mechanic so I know when I&amp;#39;m getting jerked around) but they were so incompetent, that it took them 6 hours to basically figure out that the battery needed to be replaced and then do it. They lied to me when they told me the tested the battery when they first pulled it in the bay. They put a new starter on, without telling me until after the fact. And then told me my engine was seized up due to there being 0 oil in it. Which I dont know if I believe, because I just got my oil changed about a week and a half ago. And I know I dont have a leak. So either they were lying or the technician at the luge shop didnt put oil back in my car. But anyway, long story short. They forced me to pay 600$ for basically a battery change. And then I had to go back to work 2 hours later, with no sleep since my last shift. So that was great. But that 600$ was going to be for my rent. No I dont have any money. And I&amp;#39;m not sure what I&amp;#39;m going to do. I think I&amp;#39;ve finally reached my breaking point.&lt;/p&gt;

,depression,"Nowadays people are starting to embrace body positivity and are learning to love who they are. So why can’t I? Every time I look in the mirror all I see are flaws. My stomach bulges out too much, my face is fat, my acne is ugly, I need to shave, my teeth are yellow, my butt’s too small, etc. Why can’t I see the good in myself?

My biggest insecurity is my stomach. I can’t help to think that I’m fat even though I have an average BMI at 5’5” , 140 with playing a sport/working out every day.  I think this insecurity sort of stems from everyone around me being stick thin. This one girl in my grade keeps saying how “fat” she is when she’s half a foot taller than me and weighs less. I know that shouldn’t bother me but it does. I also am a gymnast and seeing everyone around me be thin and look good in leotards makes me feel awful.

After eating a lot, I can’t help but be so mad at myself later for putting on so much weight, but sometimes I just can’t help it. I like food. It’s gotten to a point where my lunch is just a granola bar and I’m just hungry throughout my day.

I can't work during PA school because my days are 15 hours long including class and nonstop studying. I am never going to be good at anything. I have endometriosis and my surgery was supposed to be during the 3 weeks chunk I have off between spring and summer semesters but now I can't because they're booked so I have to spend 9 more months being in pain. I can't go anywhere, I'm trapped here with my own thoughts. I hate my family situation because my dad is rude and critical, my stepmom is a bitch, and my mom ruined my family. there is literally no point to living because I can't ever have anything I want nor is my life fair in the slightest. fuck it all I want to die but I don't.

Something doesn&amp;#39;t seem right there. Also, I know there is something wrong because hardly want to talk to anyone nowadays. I have no friends out of choice as an example. I dreamt of working very insular jobs growing up. Well may as well kill myself because no one can help they can give me placebos but they won&amp;#39;t give me the one thing which will cure depression and other mental illnesses in an instant but they can&amp;#39;t give me the job I wanted to do with my life so tell me what is the point?

,depression,"A month ago I was feeling suicidal. During that period I had a conversation with my son's 16 year old cousin from his mom's side of the family.

I know it's pathetic, but it's just the way it is. And obviously I have big self steem issues and hate the way I look. Every time I look in the mirror I think of how ugly and disgusting I am, I actually try to avoid looking because I know I'll get depressed(more than I usually am on a regular day). I keep writing these posts on reddit because it's better to share the way I'm feeling than just rot in my room, maybe I can find some cool person to chat with and make my existence a bit less miserable? who knows.

In a way I feel kinda guilty for having those thoughts cause I really think this earth is amazing, I hate myself for wasting my life like that but I think it&amp;#39;s the only way i&amp;#39;ll feel at peace with myself, though I admit i&amp;#39;m scared of death, I&amp;#39;m scared of the emptiness that will come after. but I&amp;#39;m also scared of the emptiness I feel now, while I&amp;#39;m still breathing yet unable to feel true joy and enjoy it to the fullest. I guess 2019 is my last year. I&amp;#39;m crying as I type this, I just wish things were different, I wish I was much more than I am now. I rarely leave the house but when I do I always feel a bit sadder when I see a couple together or just a group of friends having fun. I know I&amp;#39;m too awkward and weird to live life like they do. I know it&amp;#39;s pathetic, but it&amp;#39;s just the way it is. And obviously I have big self steem issues and hate the way I look. Every time I look in the mirror I think of how ugly and disgusting I am, I actually try to avoid looking because I know I&amp;#39;ll get depressed(more than I usually am on a regular day). I keep writing these posts on reddit because it&amp;#39;s better to share the way I&amp;#39;m feeling than just rot in my room, maybe I can find some cool person to chat with and make my existence a bit less miserable? who knows. I really feel sorry for my parents, cause they have no idea how I really feel, and I just can&amp;#39;t picture myself saying all this to them. I wish I could kill myself without making my family suffer. They don&amp;#39;t need to just because I&amp;#39;m a piece of shit loser&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I just can&amp;#39;t&lt;/p&gt;

I’m begging for someone to help because I feel like no one cares. 

The worst part is being tired. I’m so fucking sick of being exhausted no matter what I do. I’m always in a fog no matter how much sleep I get and I can’t focus or think. My head always hurts. I feel like my body is shutting down. I don’t have an appetite and I lost about 20 lbs since the summer. I gained some back and started hating the way I look so that’s going for me too now. Now I don’t eat because 1. it makes me feel sick 2. I hate the way I look 3. I know it’ll hurt me. I’m fucking sick of all of it. 

For my entire life, I’m supposed to have been perfect. I can’t admit any of this to anyone because I’m so scared of being pitied or being vulnerable. My grades are slipping and I don’t know how to deal with it because my entire life is being a perfect student who’s going to get into a perfect college and if I can’t do that I’m fucking worthless and I should just be dead. On top of all that I think I might be a lesbian, and that is one of the things I hate most about myself, more than my body or personality or grades or anything else. 

I think about killing myself every single day but I’m too scared to do it. I have a plan and I have a suicide note written down just in case so it’s ready if I decide to ever do it. I don’t even want to die. I just want all of this garbage to be over. I’m 17 and I feel like I’m not going to make it another year if things keep going the way they are and I’m honestly scared. I just wish I was never born so that I wouldn’t even have to go through killing myself and that way no one would be hurt if I was dead.

During the beginning of my teenage years, (13) I didn’t care about anything, how i looked, or anything of that sort. Looking in mirrors was fine, and life was good.

,depression,"I did something stupid. 

I only talk to one person about my mental health. She is the only person who has ever helped me not be depressed. After being depressed and okay-ish at my best for about a decade, talking to her made me feel happy. And it wasn't just for a minute, an hour, or a day. I felt happy for about half a year. 

That was what led me to tell her. I wanted to thank her, and I couldn't say thank you without telling her why. When I told her about my mental health, she was supportive. Even though I haven't felt happy in about five months, I still look forward to talking to her.

But today I did something stupid. I started an argument over something that so trivial that one noticed it. Usually when I am speaking to anyone, I try to think about what I say before I say it, because I would hate to say anything that bothers people, but not today. Today, I when I was with her, I didn't once stop to think about what I was saying. If it came to mind, I said it. 

I didn't think she was bothered until she told tried to tell me something like ""I spend my whole life making sure I don't... Isn't it ironic that that I end up doing that?"" As she said that, I saw her face get red and ber eyes start to tear up a little. And I realized that I was being a fucking asshole. 

She has never asked me to do anything. Not a single time. She has helped me when I am having suicidal thought. She has helped me when I feel like I am about to have a mental breakdown. She has helped me through a lot. And I just go and return the favor by being the worst person to her.

I have been trying to distance myself from her, because in the past couple of months, life just hasn't felt like its for me. I don't think that I should ever feel better. Depression is exactly what I deserve. Everytime I have caught myself feeling a little better, I just tell myself what I have to feel like shit again. Now, I will find it easier to no longer talk to her. As much as I looked forward to talking to her, I look forward to her forgetting me.

There isn't a whole lot keeping me from having the thought that makes me take my last, she is one of the two things that even just thinking of her helps me keep the suicidal thoughts just thoughts. I think she still wants to talk, and I know I will see her for at least the next 2 months, but when those 2 months are up. I won't talk to her, and I will do everything that I can to keep me from ever talking to her again. I don't want to make her sad or ever make her cry again.

Right now, I know I probably won't gather up the courage to end it, because I still have to see her. But I did resently take up self harm. I started by hitting my upper thigh, so no one would see the marks. Recently, I started growing out my hair, so that no one will notice that I started hitting my head. A while after I see her for my last time, the odds that I'll finally do it will rise.

Even though I haven&amp;#39;t felt happy in about five months, I still look forward to talking to her.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But today I did something stupid. I started an argument over something that so trivial that one noticed it. Usually when I am speaking to anyone, I try to think about what I say before I say it, because I would hate to say anything that bothers people, but not today. Today, I when I was with her, I didn&amp;#39;t once stop to think about what I was saying. If it came to mind, I said it. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I didn&amp;#39;t think she was bothered until she told tried to tell me something like &amp;quot;I spend my whole life making sure I don&amp;#39;t... Isn&amp;#39;t it ironic that that I end up doing that?&amp;quot; As she said that, I saw her face get red and ber eyes start to tear up a little. And I realized that I was being a fucking asshole. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She has never asked me to do anything. Not a single time. She has helped me when I am having suicidal thought. She has helped me when I feel like I am about to have a mental breakdown. She has helped me through a lot. And I just go and return the favor by being the worst person to her.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have been trying to distance myself from her, because in the past couple of months, life just hasn&amp;#39;t felt like its for me. I don&amp;#39;t think that I should ever feel better. Depression is exactly what I deserve. Everytime I have caught myself feeling a little better, I just tell myself what I have to feel like shit again. Now, I will find it easier to no longer talk to her. As much as I looked forward to talking to her, I look forward to her forgetting me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There isn&amp;#39;t a whole lot keeping me from having the thought that makes me take my last, she is one of the two things that even just thinking of her helps me keep the suicidal thoughts just thoughts. I think she still wants to talk, and I know I will see her for at least the next 2 months, but when those 2 months are up. I won&amp;#39;t talk to her, and I will do everything that I can to keep me from ever talking to her again. I don&amp;#39;t want to make her sad or ever make her cry again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Right now, I know I probably won&amp;#39;t gather up the courage to end it, because I still have to see her. But I did resently take up self harm. I started by hitting my upper thigh, so no one would see the marks. Recently, I started growing out my hair, so that no one will notice that I started hitting my head. A while after I see her for my last time, the odds that I&amp;#39;ll finally do it will rise.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I fucking hate that I possibly made someone feel anywhere near how if feel most of the time. I hate myself even more for doing it to the only person I have ever felt safe enough to tell everything about anything.&lt;/p&gt;

I just can&amp;#39;t keep this up. I have been fighting since I was a child, I&amp;#39;m a 38 year old man (ha) now. What do I have to offer to this world? All I am is a leech. I have no skills. I was never good in school because of my mental illness and no one would diagnose it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I hate myself and so does the world. I&amp;#39;ll never be more than this.&lt;/p&gt;

A lot of it is just small things.

It just all piles up so fucking much. I feel like I'll just constantly have bad luck in life.

&lt;p&gt;A lot of it is just small things. Constantly getting the worst loot in video games, missing the public bus by like 30 seconds, etc. I always make small personal bets with myself like if I get a notification on Instagram I&amp;#39;ll just be like &amp;quot;I bet this specific person didn&amp;#39;t like this post&amp;quot; and I look at the notification and it&amp;#39;s exactly that. This kind of shit is constantly happening everyday. By themselves it&amp;#39;s not bad at all, but it really builds up and starts eating away at you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And then there&amp;#39;s bigger things. Like being 5&amp;#39;2 as a male is pretty bad. I have mental illnesses and some of it I can&amp;#39;t even relate with other mentally ill people. I get bronchitis like every fucking year. And then tonight, I just got news that a field trip to Hawaii that I&amp;#39;ve been looking forward to for FOUR FUCKING YEARS has been cancelled because of the coronavirus bullshit. Of course it had to be the ONE FUCKING YEAR IM A SENIOR AND ABLE TO GO.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It just all piles up so fucking much. I feel like I&amp;#39;ll just constantly have bad luck in life. It makes me lose excitement in things I&amp;#39;m actually excited for because I&amp;#39;m just in that mindset that it&amp;#39;ll go wrong because of my bad luck. Makes me wonder if it&amp;#39;s even worth living if I&amp;#39;m just stuck with this shit. Again, I don&amp;#39;t believe in karma or the supernatural or anything, but this shit really makes me question it.&lt;/p&gt;

I tried to see psychologist but I have to wait untill at least april. This is a free psychologist and I can't afford to see another one earlier if it means I have to pay. My credit card has been stolen anyway lol.

Anyway, my way of coping with all of this is to put myself in danger and make myself feel physically bad in the hope I will feel more valid in my suffering and that I will finally be able to ask for help and feel like I deserve it.

,depression,"&gt; **[Trigger Warning: self-harm descriptions]** I found this in my notes in my phone from 4 years ago. I forgot how much I used to write about what it was like living inside my mind back when I was at my lowest point.

**Chemical Imbalance**  

It always starts with something taken out of proportion. A misread text, a misunderstood gesture, a misjudged opinion, or a misguided tone.  
“I love you.” They attempt to bring you back to a reasoning reality.  
But love isn't *love* anymore.  
Love is fake.  
Love is wrong.  
Love is *hate*.  
*I hate you*. Their mimicked voice echoes.   
Triggering the avalanche of spiteful words spraying from your pale lips.   
*They hate you*. The voice darkens.  
You watch them slowly fall into your torturous whirlwind of abuse. You watch them cry for help and ask for you to stop and listen to yourself, listening to you hate yourself and want to die is too much for them.  
Then you watch them leave. You watch them run away in fear.   

Your bony fingers crack as they clench into a fist. Your jagged nails are digging into your skin.   
Anger engulfs your vision, taking control of rationality.  
The first blow strikes hard on your face. It stings, but you go a second time. And a third. Until your head starts ringing.   
*You seriously fucked up this time*. The dark voice echoes.  
You can't see anything for what it really is.  
“But you said they hated me!” You argue with the little self-worth you have left.   
*Yes, and you believed me. You stupid little girl*.  
That restless feeling of guilt starts trickling down your spine. Did you jump to conclusions? Did you just impulsively hurt a loved one’s feelings? Did you just make them witness something so traumatic it will never leave them?  
*Yes, you're a twisted abuser*.  

No, you can't be here. You can't be alive anymore. You don't deserve it. You have hurt someone who needs you, you have acted out of spite.  
*Do it. You're worthless. They don't want or need you here*.  
More impulsive actions unfold, you only want to escape the guilt and anger that overfills your head. But you're scared to do it. You're scared to make the final exit by your hand.   
*Cowardice. You can't live and you can't die. You are pathetic*.  

The razor is in view. Tears are finally pushing out, causing more pain than the blade that now pierces your skin. Scarred and thin, the skin breaks. But no satisfaction is found unless you cut too deep. Only disappointment seeps in, blaming yourself for your cowardly slashes. Not going deep enough, pathetic little scratches. Why can't you feel more pain? Why can't you cut deeper?   
*You fail at even the simplest things*.  
You cut more. Faster, harder. You want centimetres, not millimetres.  
But still the same depth, still the same shit.  

There’re too many cuts now. But still no pain, only numbness from the raw wounds you view.   
But the blood won't stop. Your wrists are painted. Like stained crimson cloaks wrapped around each arm.   
You slip in the dark puddle and feel the red wetness of the towel you clench.    
“Take me!” You scream.   
“Please just take me!” You keep screaming at the otherworldly force.   
Pleading for the way out, pleading your heart would just stop.   
Now a mess of tears and blood on the floor, you weep.   
The sounds of silence bounces in your head.  
The dark voice is gone.   
Nothing.  

A door opens.   
The realisation of someone witnessing the mess you are in kicks you up.   
You can smell the shame from your cold sweat. You can see the damage you've caused yourself and the one who is about the enter.  

“I'm sorry.” You whisper.   
You are numb and frozen as they wrap the bandages around your wrists.   
“I'm sorry.”   
You can see the pain in their eyes. You can feel the fear in their trembles. You can hear the confusion in their silence.  

*You don't deserve this love*. The dark voice echoes.   
And then you fall back into the abyss.",t2_iwpv4lx,False,,0,False,"""Chemical Imbalance""",[],r/depression,False,0.0,,0,False,t3_fea7zb,False,dark,,public,2,0,{},,False,[],,False,False,,{},,False,2,,False,,1583481145.0,,[],{},,True,,1583509657.0,text,0.0,,,text,self.depression,False,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;

That restless feeling of guilt starts trickling down your spine. Did you jump to conclusions? Did you just impulsively hurt a loved one’s feelings? Did you just make them witness something so traumatic it will never leave them?&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Yes, you&amp;#39;re a twisted abuser&lt;/em&gt;.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No, you can&amp;#39;t be here. You can&amp;#39;t be alive anymore. You don&amp;#39;t deserve it. You have hurt someone who needs you, you have acted out of spite.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Do it. You&amp;#39;re worthless. They don&amp;#39;t want or need you here&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;br/&gt;
More impulsive actions unfold, you only want to escape the guilt and anger that overfills your head. But you&amp;#39;re scared to do it. You&amp;#39;re scared to make the final exit by your hand.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Cowardice. You can&amp;#39;t live and you can&amp;#39;t die. You are pathetic&lt;/em&gt;.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The razor is in view. Tears are finally pushing out, causing more pain than the blade that now pierces your skin. Scarred and thin, the skin breaks. But no satisfaction is found unless you cut too deep. Only disappointment seeps in, blaming yourself for your cowardly slashes. Not going deep enough, pathetic little scratches. Why can&amp;#39;t you feel more pain? Why can&amp;#39;t you cut deeper?&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;em&gt;You fail at even the simplest things&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;br/&gt;
You cut more. Faster, harder. You want centimetres, not millimetres.&lt;br/&gt;
But still the same depth, still the same shit.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There’re too many cuts now. But still no pain, only numbness from the raw wounds you view.&lt;br/&gt;
But the blood won&amp;#39;t stop. Your wrists are painted. Like stained crimson cloaks wrapped around each arm.&lt;br/&gt;
You slip in the dark puddle and feel the red wetness of the towel you clench.&lt;br/&gt;
“Take me!” You scream.&lt;br/&gt;
“Please just take me!” You keep screaming at the otherworldly force.&lt;br/&gt;
Pleading for the way out, pleading your heart would just stop.&lt;br/&gt;
Now a mess of tears and blood on the floor, you weep.&lt;br/&gt;
The sounds of silence bounces in your head.&lt;br/&gt;
The dark voice is gone.&lt;br/&gt;
Nothing.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A door opens.&lt;br/&gt;
The realisation of someone witnessing the mess you are in kicks you up.&lt;br/&gt;
You can smell the shame from your cold sweat. You can see the damage you&amp;#39;ve caused yourself and the one who is about the enter.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“I&amp;#39;m sorry.” You whisper.&lt;br/&gt;
You are numb and frozen as they wrap the bandages around your wrists.&lt;br/&gt;
“I&amp;#39;m sorry.”&lt;br/&gt;
You can see the pain in their eyes. You can feel the fear in their trembles. You can hear the confusion in their silence.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;You don&amp;#39;t deserve this love&lt;/em&gt;. The dark voice echoes.&lt;br/&gt;
And then you fall back into the abyss.&lt;/p&gt;

I was once proud of this and now i see it as a neutral thing, but i joined the army. at first i loved the comeraderie, pt, rucks, etc. and basic was a lot of fun with the grenades, obstacle courses, etc. but now im an academic fail out from AIT (job training in the army). its really painful living as a holdover. for those who are thinking ""wtf is a holdover?"": a holdover is someone who for whatever reason failed from their training, got injured, or in at least moderately serious trouble. the job of a holdover is mostly sitting on bleachers all day near the drill sergeants officespace until the end of the workday.  they will sometimes clean or perform some paper work on occasion. i contribute nothing, do nothing, and all the while watching my old friends earn the exact position that i spent the last several months of working my heart out for. im not angry at them, so much as i am just really... frustrated. because of my jobs academic difficulty, this is really not uncommon but ive been stuck here as a holdover for over a month now. 9 hours per day, 5 days per week, of sitting and doing next to nothing. i feel like a drain on society while also miserable with the ""work"" i am doing. 

i used to think that i wasnt contributing to anything while training but was fine with it because my job was to learn to be a soldier. but now i have no job, no purpose, and none of the old freedoms i had as a civilian as a consolation. i still have to abide by the ""battle buddy"" system in which soldiers in basic and AIT cannot ever be without another soldier around except for very specific circumstances. i am not allowed off base (which is less than 2 square miles of space). and i cannot have things like electronics during the time in which im ""working"" to pass the time. this has all made me thoroughly reexamine my reasons for every decision ive ever made.

at first when i failed out i knew id be sent to a new MOS (army job). id hoped for armor (tank stuff), artillery, infantry, or really just anything except for signals (computers, which frustrate me to my wits end), medical (im afraid of needles), and transport (i hate working on cars). and the drill sergeant said the best case scenario, id be sent off to be an IT specialist. i was nothing short of devastated. 

Just one month ago, i was what youd think of when you thought of a bubbly, outgoing, and motivated soldier. Today i realized i had an issue when a drill sgt that i very much look up to came back after being gone for a few months and she noticed that i was showing signs of being ""off"" before i even really said anything. 

I used to be really great at pt, and now im doing so poorly that i may get kicked out of the army entirely. im stressed, saddened by my prospects, and overall just ashamed of where i am. if it werent for my gf whose been nothing short of incredible, there is no way i would have ever made it this far. but now it feels like in the process of joining the army, i started walking from new york to california, i was getting close to nevada until i tripped, got knocked the fuck out, and woke up in ohio. and now im just staring at the map thinking how itd be so much easier to just turn back and cut my losses.

,depression,"Recently, im going through a severe depressive episode and I did some things I would not have otherwise done that are now affecting my mental health further and affecting someone I love. 

I would like to hear those with severe depression talk about whether they feel they have the ability to consent and make decisions on sensitive matters during severe depressive episodes.

It feels like society tells everyone that it is their fault if they make a bad decision, that they are responsible for their choices, and most dont understand mental illness properly and to me its not that black and white. 

I want to know whether you think you truly have the capacity to be at fault for a decision youve made if it is something you would not have done outside an acute depressive episode.

Four abilities are usually assessed with decision making when I was looking around. The only studies I found were for research purposes (which saddens me, but thats a whole other topic).

The four abilities:
Understanding
Appreciating
Reasoning
Ability to express a choice

Now I cant say I know the exact ways to interpet these 4 things right now without further research but, do you feel you possess these abilities during a severe depressive episode? Do you possess some and not others? Does it vary? 

My answer would be during a severe depressive episode, I do not possess any of these reliably at every moment. It is not consistent enough for me to able to say I possess any of them during these times.

,depression,"Hi I don't really know how to phrase this situation but I'll try. My life is at a really good point right now, I'm never really depressed over stuff and 99 percent of the time my mind is clear. I'm about to graduate high school and I'm really excited. However, people in my family and friend group have tons of issues. Wether they sleep all day, hate themselves, or have no ambition to keep living on in this world, they've got problems. I don't wanna sound like I'm gloating, but usually I'm the person that a lot of these people end up going to because usually I'm able to talk people through issues and help them in the long run. Yeah sometimes their issues make me really sad and stuff because who doesn't feel sad when people are telling you they feel worthless.

But today one of my best friends showed me that he was cutting and it really effected me. I talked to him about it and it's mostly because of how painfully ""bored"" he is and he doesn't even know why he's doing it (he's a pretty logical guy). He will go to class and just sit there for and hour most of the time doing nothing challenging because that's the way our school works. He has clinically diagnosed depression, has been to a psychiatric ward, and sees a therapist regularly. It's only been a couple hours since he showed me his arm, and I didn't even see all of it. 

I've got two main problems right now. First I don't really know how to help him. He said literally the only thing I can really do is just hang out with him after school and on the weekends so he doesn't just sit in bed all day. I've been trying to make an effort to do that as much as I can but I need to do more. He said himself that as long as he goes to highschool, and considering it's the law, he's going to feel this way until we graduate. I just need to know something I can do to help him, do I tell his parents? A therapist won't help he already goes to one. Should I talk to him more about it tomorrow. I just don't know

Second, stuff like this is really effecting me. I just feel that the world is being unfair to everyone I care about and I just want everyone I love to feel better. As of lately I've been feeling depressed whenever my friends need to talk about issues and it's really weighing down on me. I just don't want to leave the people I care about down in the dirt. 

So yeah if anyone has any advice whatsoever please help me. Im normally able to deal with these feelings and help my friends but right now I'm struggling.

I don't understand. I have an amazing boyfriend and friends, my family is shitty but I know they do love me, I've just suffered from so much emotional trauma from them.

About a year and a half ago, he had a surgery that required removing roughly 6 feet of his intestines. Due to us not having health insurance until recently, hes been unable to do follow up appointments or get onto much needed medication to manage his disease. His Crohns is getting worse. We finally got him into the doctor's in January when we got health insurance. They've done several CT scans, and keep finding more and more abcesses developing in his intestines. He has another surgery scheduled for this upcoming Tuesday, but he had to go into the hospital again today, due to an abscess that is bulging out of his stomach. I have two puppies at home. With my husband being in the hospital, and myself working ridiculous hours, it puts a lot more on my plate than I have already with work. I feel like a narcissistic POS wife, because while my poor husband is in the hospital, I'm more worried about how much more stress has been put on me.

,depression,"I've been feeling incredibly lonely recently. My psychiatrist can't see me until next Friday (she isn't covered under my insurance).

TL;DR Tell me some kindness you've witnessed or received.

I have been unemployed since December and I was holding on until I got my tax refund so I could see my psychiatrist for new meds, fixing my car, anything until I can get another job. Then the government took it all for student loans.

I used all my energy and grit to get here, only to be still stranded and lower than ever. I don't talk to my friends anymore about it because they just think being strong is the key and that I will be fine. I don't feel fine.

,depression,"I just got back from a week long stay on the big island of Hawaii. I had some of the coolest experiences from seeing a shark while snorkeling, to being right next to feeding manta rays. It was an amazing trip and I loved it so much. 

But the problem I have is that whenever I have gone on vacations, even when I was young, I would cry and be horribly depressed for the next few days to a week or two. I hate going on vacations because I know that I’m going to feel like shit after. Nothing feels right when I come home and I just want to be spending “one more day” out away from real life. I hate it because I know that I will have to go back to work and that I won’t get another vacation like this for a very long time. I hate that I can’t explain how I’m feeling to my wife because she’s lucky enough not to have to experience depression except from a third person perspective. 

I so badly want to still be out on Hawaii, or anywhere I’ve gone on vacation to, because out there, I don’t have to care about work; I don’t have to care about school, bills, or family drama. I can just be. I don’t want to have to go back to work and school on Monday, but I know I have to or else things will be worse in the long run. I hate that I’m feeling like I shouldn’t have gone to Hawaii in the first place. 

I loved spending all that time with my wife and enjoying that week together. I loved seeing things that I never have before and being somewhere that I haven’t been. I loved having that time to do whatever I wanted and not feeling badly that I didn’t do anything I didn’t want to. I loved the anticipation and excitement leading up to the day we left. 

I think that’s from where a lot of my depression stems: building up the anticipation, then it’s here and it’s so great, but then it’s gone sooner than it arrived, and you go back to anticipating nothing. 

I feel like life is mostly boring, dull, and no one really wants to admit that, so when you get a few days to enjoy yourself, after, it feels like the nothingness deepens and you sink further into it.

,depression,"I had a depressive episode so I moved back home, and have had depression for years but never confided in anyone. 

My parents are great and caring, and my mom is even a nurse, like 80% of the time they’re great.

But sometimes my mom can bug me.. like in the waiting room at the clinic while waiting to get recommended for a psychiatrist for depression she says: You still have it right?

Like what?! She has a nursing degree and asked that. I mean she’s usually very supportive but just this small thing makes me very confused. I am doing much better now that I have a routine and am not alone and suicidal everyday but just because you don’t see my depression doesn’t mean My depression went away.

I’ve hid it for at least 6 years and i was very good at it. I’m an actor. But it irks me that she would say that.

I’m 19 and sorta tall sometimes when we’re out shopping or something she talks about things that I’d rather not discuss in the middle of the mall, like “oh, yeah we should discuss when you should attend classes,” and we never discuss this at home.

It feels like she’s justifying my presence, like this is why I’m here with my 19 year old son on a Monday shopping and he’s not in school. Honestly it’s embarrassing and even if Im overthinking it I feel anxiety in public and I really don’t like standing out.

I’m pretty sure my depressions from her side of the family as she and her grandmother have had antidepressants. Don’t get me wrong we’re close and I love her, but sometimes it’s very annoying and any constructive criticism I give the way she responds is never in a way that doesn’t make me feel guilty about pointing something out.

Whenever there’s a problem she seems to blow it out of proportion, and I’ve stopped trying to help because if we go down a wrong street I become implicated in the problem and she makes it feel as if the world is ending even though everything works out. 

Sometimes it feels like she lets things go wrong on purpose, I can’t even count the times we have gone out for something and she forgot her bags, or we forgot to bring some package for the post office, or something similar. Whenever this happens she says “oh I should have thought of that” “I’m so stupid” “I should have known” and it makes me feel as if she is expecting me to remind her of these things. I appreciate all the things she does but if it’s something she organizes for example shopping like I have no control over what she forgets to bring but she somehow makes me feel responsible, or at least I do somehow. 

I just can’t understand this negative side to her and it seems like somethings always wrong and if it is she exacerbates it, I can’t tell if it’s from her depression if she has low self esteem and is hard on herself if she makes mistakes or makes mistakes on purpose, regardless it affects me.

I know not everything here was directly about depression but I thought because it relates to my situation might as well say what’s on my mind.

,depression,"Hi I'm 23 years old
It was October 2019,
I was having intense headaches and nausea, it was my birthday the 24th. My family thought it was normal because of my period 2 weeks go by the pain is worse and in tense. I was taken to a hospital, and a neurologist saw me and said I had no signs of any problems whatsoever but to make sure he prescribed me declofenac and to get a resonance on my head. 

No tumors where found and the declofenac made my problems worsen, I went to a different hospital where my grandmother sister works as head of emergency and pediatrician. The doctor who attended me stated I was fine and had nothing, I studied for a nursing license and knew the look in the doctors face when I told her I'm still in pain after administrating medication was of ""she just wants drugs"" face. I told my grandmas sister and she told me, that the doctor who attended me they always fight because of her attitude and insinuation on patients. At this time I was already 2 months in pain, my family tried to look for other know neurologist in the field to see what's going on and none of them knew.

3 months I was talking to a friend and just for a moment I felt numb, numb as in I didn't feel any pain. My dad got scared and saw my left eye drift away, he took me to a oftalmologist. He didn't know what's going on when he checked me so he referred me to a hospital specialized in neuro-oftalmologist. I went through the emergency room and I was obviously angry frustrated you name it. The doctor checked my eyes and told me I had papilledema, and it might be cause by the birth control pills since I was always having issues with my hormones. The blood pressured my eyes thus having nausea, headaches, desoroentation, sensitivity to light, and insomnia.

I was treated for papilledema and I can't use any birth control whatsoever, but now I'm still sensitive to light and I see like those huge TVs in the 90s and VHS. Because my left eye was left with nerve damage, I can't see my peripheral view from both my eyes. the left eye its been losing the blur I see and it's getting darker, as in pitch black and have like a 1cm of blurred or I think even less. I'm also not being able to see most colors or differentiate in deepness (as in stairs, steps, holes etc) 

It's been 6 months now..

I changed doctors, learned myself to go through my surroundings without depending in my eye sight. I no longer have papilledema and I still get headaches even when I try to force my eye sigth, plus In December we found out my knees is more above than usual and that's why it pops out. But that time it popped out it didn't went in and now I have to use kinesiology tape to have support and control over it.

I've been snapping at a lot of people degrading me, telling me it's nothing, people are in worse situations be grateful.

But I'm not allowed to snap, I'm not allowed to defend myself, I'm not allowed to call people out when they make me feel like I've literally gone through nothing.

I have no friends, and the people I know don't know my position. Because they literally don't give a sh*T

Im social whenever I can and this was my actual fear losing my eye sight. I'm not afraid of risking it, making hard decisions, animals, crisis. My fear is actually coming true..

How am I not going to feel depressed, sad, upset, angry, frustrated....

HOW?! I literally use the keyboard voice option instead of writing and Google assistant.

Everything I liked reading books, watching old movies, going to cons...

And the worse part is my son hides from me every time he gets because he already knows mommy can't see, so I freak out when I can't hear him or feel him in the house.

When we talked about her needing professional help she said that she got professional help but it got too busy just before she could get better. She ment me, I was the ”professional” help. I have been busy so I haven’t talked to her outside of school that much and I just feel like she tried to make me feel bad that she almost got better and then I got busy.

When we talked about her needing professional help she said that she got professional help but it got too busy just before she could get better. She ment me, I was the ”professional” help. I have been busy so I haven’t talked to her outside of school that much and I just feel like she tried to make me feel bad that she almost got better and then I got busy. Like I can’t use all my free time on you, I have my own problems and life too. She doesn’t respect my boundaries and I feel like she has gotten between me and my bestfriends. I feel like I’m a bad friend but I have to choose my health first. I need some space from her but I can’t get any. I need advice! But remember, if you are depressed please get help and talk to someone, it truly helps. This is why professional help is so good, friends can help to some extent but they aren’t professionals that know how to handel these things in the best way. I just have it hard because I’m still healing and it’s not good for me right now personally.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sorry for bad grammar&lt;/p&gt;

,depression,"This feeling comes and goes and I usually keep it suppressed by submerging myself in mundane stuff. I am 34 years old and I have been dealing with these episodes of worthlessness since probably middle school. I grew up in a small rural town in Puerto Rico. I can’t say we all know each other, but everyone knows everyone else’s business. 

I  grew up in a  strict pentecostal family with many rules forced into my siblings and I. We used to go to church usually 7 days a week and on Sundays twice (Bible school in the morning and afternoon/evening service).  Secular music was prohibited and any tv material that was deemed “demonic” by the pastor. 

Of course, living in a pentecostal family made a huge impact on who I was from elementary school all the way until I decided to part ways with the faith later on in my 20s. I was so insecure about myself and tried super hard to fit in with the other kids. It was a challenge because I never felt understood by the others, mainly because I had nothing to relate with them. I was not allowed to listen to secular music or even go to the movies because of rules my mom enforced on all of us. 

That insecurity grew even stronger when entered high school, which of course was the worse years of my teenage years. There were so many things happening in my life at that moment that I thought in some weird way it was all normal. 

During the last years of elementary school my dad decided to distance himself from church. He became an alcoholic shortly after and everything went downhill from there. He multiple affairs that my mom was ware of and that didn’t turned out well for me. My mom became aggressive and depressed. I used to get hit for no reason that I can remember to this day.

I think she felt trapped because divorcing my father was not an option due to her fanaticism. My mom used to break stuff every day, scream and yell, stayed inside her room all day and praying for the most part. One positive thing I can say about her is that we were never hungry and somehow she always found ways to provide us with clothes and food. 

My dad disappeared for many months one time and I thought he gave up on us but specially on me. I felt so betrayed by him. My mom was also non-present in my life or school. My grades dropped drastically and I was bullied a lot at school for being alone the majority of the time. 

There is so much to say about everything that happened but, I thought I was over that and everything that happened. Today I am angry at my parents because how irresponsible they were with their kids. I compare myself to every one else around me and I feel like I should’ve had a better upbringing. I know it’s up to me know and they are no longer responsible but it still hurts me so much. 

I deal with my insecurities every day and that is something I’m never gonna be able to change. I compare myself a lot with everyone.  I tend to feel like a way lesser version of whoever I am comparing myself to. I’m going to therapy and that helps to a degree.

i feel like right now is the first time all week my brain has had to pause and process or actually feel something and it’s just aggressively hitting me with all the depression i’ve been stuffing down throughout the week when i didn’t have time for it. well, now i do. so here it is. 

i tried journaling. i ended up just listing ways i could kill myself right now while i’m home alone. (not gonna. wish i would, or could, but i won’t. not now). tried meditating. couldn’t focus on it or let the calm penetrate the surface. i looked at my dog and immediately started sobbing, thinking about him living without me. 

i wanted to get some fresh air and let him run around, so i let him outside and sat on the front steps. he ended up sitting right next to me. wouldn’t leave my side. i looked up and saw the moon (it was still daylight) and began crying again. my dog kept nudging me to keep a hand on him and pushing against me. it made me cry more. i talked aloud to the moon. to whatever is out there. to my late mom. begged whoever was listening to please just help me. ease the pain. do something. i do not want to do this anymore. 

sat there for a while and watched the moon move in the sky behind the bare tree branches. felt the cold air seep down to my bones. it felt good. felt good to feel something that wasn’t sadness. it calmed me down. at this point i just feel numb. back to autopilot, i guess. better than life-shatteringly sad, right? 

i wish i could tell someone “i’m feeling suicidal” and they’d drop everything to bring me chinese food and rub my back. without me saying another word. that’s what i want. ridiculous, right? but instead i tell people that and then push them away. or i don’t tell them at all. or i give subtle hints and they are completely ignored. 

actually, i wish the aid of other people would help me at all. i THINK having someone support me in this way or love me or kiss my wounds would fix it all, but it wouldn’t. i’m just terrified of the thought of dealing with this alone for another single second. i am terrified of myself. of my brain. of my sickness. my trauma. my darkness. i want someone else to come pick up all the pieces and feed me chinese food and rub my back while they do it.

&lt;p&gt;So was I suffering from clinical depression in 2014? Or was it just circumstantial thing?&lt;/p&gt;

,depression,"I have to get this off my chest or I’m going to go off on someone. So as you can read back through my posts, I was doing Spravato for a very short time before my insurance pulled the rug out from me. Two weeks into it, that’s right - TWO WEEKS, Insurance comes back after pre-approving my treatment and says since I had not shown a 50% improvement they were denying any further treatments. Thanks for the warning fuckers! So of course my depression and anxiety dropped severely after this happened. Partly because of being pissed and irate and outright shocked about how they could even do this. And second, my body and mind didn’t care for how I just suddenly stopped treatments. So I’ve been on a downward spiral for about two weeks now. 
Well the clinic where I was having the treatments has not really got back to me and kind of dropped me like a bad habit now that they aren’t getting money from my insurance. When the lady called to tell me she said she would talk to the dr in charge of the program and ask him what he wanted to do. That was almost two weeks ago. I’ve spoke to her once since and tried calling several times with no call back. Like seriously ... What the fuck? You have someone who was telling you I was severely depressed and suicidal (enough to get approved for disability - which is not easy to do!) and you’re just gonna fucking ignore my calls and my concerns and let me go to the wayside? What happened to checking with the dr to ask him about a next step? Is that it? Is it just like - well no more Spravato for you so we are done dealing with you?! I’m fed the fuck up quite honestly. And after waiting all week since talking to her Monday, I’m going to call tomorrow and I’m asking to speak to a supervisor or someone in charge of that fucking place. Let me just add also that when I first contacted them to set up my initial appointment, it took almost two months before I got in there! That’s right! Two months! It was the beginning of December when I first called and someone was supposed to call me back and I waited and waited and finally called and went off asking them “do I have to say I’m suicidal before someone will take me seriously and call me back??” It was soon after I finally got in there but to me that’s a little ridiculous to think of making a suicidal person wait almost two months to start treatment or be evaluated. 
Between that and the insurance screwing me, I’m truly and utterly fed up. It makes me sick and pissed off how the system fails people like me and then they wonder why mental illness is such an issue and has such a stigma around it! Well no fucking wonder. If others are treated anything like I have been, and I have a feeling that many are, then I can see why people lose their shit and either end up killing them selves or others. Let me clarify - I’m NOT in any way condoning that behavior or saying it’s okay. I’m simply saying that it’s no wonder there’s such an issue with mental illness in this county. 
All that being said, where does one go from here? I’ve tried therapists, countless medicines, obviously the Spravato - all to come to this. To pretty much be treated as if my life means nothing and completely and utterly ignored! I hate to sound narcissistic, but god damn. My life should be just as important as anyone else’s. 
Here’s the conclusion I’ve pretty much come to in the last 24 hours. I have to stop depending on anyone to help me deal with this fucking sickness. I have to depend on myself to somehow get better. I am the only one who is here for me. Nobody else gives a fuck. Nobody. Why should they? They have nothing invested in me and I mean nothing. If they aren’t getting money from insurance then why bother even returning my phone call right? 
I don’t know. If this is what our society has come to, I seriously want no part of it anymore. It’s disgusting and I am to the point where I hate people in general. I know that sounds bad, but go back up and re-read my post if you really want to try to understand why I am starting to hate people. I wasn’t always this way. Yes, I’ve dealt with mental illness most my life in some capacity or another. But here in the last 5 years it has hit the absolute bottom of the bottom. I look back at times when I thought I was depressed before and I think to myself - I’d give anything to go back to that time and redo things. 
I don’t really have anything else to say. I’ve rambled on enough. I just had to get this all out in some way. If you made it to this and have read my whole post then thank you.

Using a throwaway account, but I frequent this sub on my main account. Anyway, I need some advice. I can't trust my girlfriend when I'm depressed. The both of us deal with anxiety and depression, but she doesnt seem to get me when I'm depressed. Don't get me wrong, we both have our faults, but we always do our best to understand each other and walk through hard times with one another. However,  the last two times that I have been very depressed, she ended up pushing me away when I needed her the most. About a month ago she got very upset with me that she walked over to me and angrily accused me of not showing enough attention to our relationship. I had a family member pass just a few weeks before, and I think it was finally getting to me. I apologized, told her that I'm depressed, saying that I wish I could be doing better. I told her that I was depressed and she walked away, angry, slamming the door behind her. The person that I love the most turned her back on me when I needed her the most. I went for a walk, we messaged each other, and she asked me to come back. She was crying so much, I felt bad. She felt terrible for not listening to me. This wasn't the first time that something like this has happened though. When I am depressed, she pushes me away. Besides this, my girlfriend is incredibly loving, thoughtful, creative in our relationship, and sacrifices so much for us. But this, this hurts so fucking bad.

I had a family member pass just a few weeks before, and I think it was finally getting to me. I apologized, told her that I&amp;#39;m depressed, saying that I wish I could be doing better. I told her that I was depressed and she walked away, angry, slamming the door behind her. The person that I love the most turned her back on me when I needed her the most. I went for a walk, we messaged each other, and she asked me to come back. She was crying so much, I felt bad. She felt terrible for not listening to me. This wasn&amp;#39;t the first time that something like this has happened though. When I am depressed, she pushes me away. Besides this, my girlfriend is incredibly loving, thoughtful, creative in our relationship, and sacrifices so much for us. But this, this hurts so fucking bad. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Reddit, have you experienced something similar? Where do you turn when you&amp;#39;re depressed? Have you talked to your SO about this and have you fixed it? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;tl;dr My very loving girlfriend pushes me away when I&amp;#39;m depressed, don&amp;#39;t know what to do or where to go when I&amp;#39;m feeling like this.&lt;/p&gt;

,depression,"I reached out yesterday... I called 111. I needed to. But now, am I glad I did or do I regret it?

 Depression at varying degrees has been my state of existence for so long, I don't know who I am without it. Yes, I have good times that are not as bad... But they are short-lived. Fleeting.

I last had medical help a few years ago. Therapy and meds helped. Therapy ended... Then I missed an appointment for a med check and I don't reschedule when that happens... I don't want to waste anyone's time.

My state was tolerable. Manageable. I stopped self harming more than a year and a half ago. I'm proud of that, even if that long stretch came from a bad relapse... I don't want to ruin it now. I really don't.

The thing is, my mental state has been deteriorating over the past few months... Year? More? I don't even know... Occasional thoughts of hurting myself I can ignore and move on from. But they, like the happy times, are usually fleeting. As are worse thoughts. Now... It's persistent. And fighting it is exhausting. Reached a point yesterday where I honestly did not feel safe. So I called. 111 put me onto the rapid response team. Had a meeting today. Have a doctor's appointment tomorrow. Have to see them ever day for a little under two weeks.

But that doesn't stop the thoughts... I feel guilty because I feel like I'm taking valuable resources away from someone else who needs them. But I'm also worried... I lose chunks of time... My memory is crap and I can forget things minutes later sometimes (it's intermittent)... I have no energy or drive to do... Anything... I can't focus on conversations and constantly have to ask people to repeat themselves. I've been getting persistent chest pains and my vision is just... Weird. I can't explain completely. And I'm constantly fighting the need to do... Something. I need to hurt. But I can't let myself. And it's exhausting.

So all these strategies coming in and I keep asking myself... I don't even want help. Or do I? I don't know. I know I reached out and I know I can't keep doing this without professional help. My SO also can't keep up with this... He isn't a professional and it's so unfair to him. I want to be better for him as well as... I just want to be normal... To function. But all this outside help.

&lt;p&gt;Even if you&amp;#39;re alone now, don&amp;#39;t depend on someone to &amp;quot;save you&amp;quot;, become your own HERO, that person took a long time to appear in my life, but before her, i was already becoming a better person, she just put me in a shotcut to that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sorry for my bad english, good luck on your life.&lt;/p&gt;

,depression,"Hi guys. I've been struggling with a relapse into severe depression for the last couple of months. I've been seeing a psychiatrist who has changed me onto new meds, and I'm slowly starting to come good, but the last couple of days I've been in a deep funk, just not interested in doing anything, not eating, barely talking. I've spent most of my time in bed, or watching youtube, or both. I don't know if it's the change in meds (probably) or what, but I wanted to share a ridiculous moment I just had. 

My dog (a 5yo kelpie named Max) walked into my room, and nudged his butt against my knee like he does when he wants pats. I wasn't feeling it, and nudged him away. He came back, sat down on my foot, and let rip with a huge fart. Right on my foot. I started laughing - I haven't laughed in the last couple of days - and I kept laughing for a solid five minutes. I opened the window to clear the air (also haven't opened the window in the last couple of days) and all of a sudden the funk was over. It was like he poured cold water over my head and my vision cleared. I'm sitting at my desk in the fresh air, still smiling, and about to start on some uni work I have to get a jump on.  Max is napping on my bed like the champion he is.

,depression,"I am almost 40, on disability morbidly obese and can't lose weight no matter how hard I try.   I am almost 40, with nothing but a 500 dollar laptop that my neighbor gave me that is falling apart and only worth around 70 if that. a pair of shoes that are falling apart and hurt when I walk in them. about a dozen worn-out socks and a few shirts and pants all black. mostly sweat pants and two pairs of blue jeans and a worn-out wallet that is falling apart on me. 

I am on disability getting less than 800$ USD a month and have no educational background no GED was homeless for over 8 years and have bad teeth because of it. some need fixing and one needs a new crown. I wasn't taught dental hygiene until I became homeless and even then brushing and flossing was the least of my worries. it was more of getting food and trying to survive. 

I spent the past few years trying to get my GED and failed even with tutors and teachers and study groups found out I have learning issues that make it hard for me to get my GED and I basically have to go from the 2nd and 3rd grade to 12th grade in every subject.

I have no family, no friends. I am utterly alone in this world. Bought a car two years ago was my first car and was planning on living in it but got scammed out of 3k. been trying to save again for another car to live in but been unable to. 

Renting a bedroom from an elderly woman with bad health and she is going in for surgery today if she doesn't make it I will be homeless again nowhere to live and unable to survive being homeless this time. My body has arthritis in my lower back, rheumatoid arthritis in my knees and feet. there's days that I just can't get out of bed because of it hurting so badly. there is no way I can survive being on the streets again.

I feel like complete and utter crap especially compared to everyone else and now realizing how worthless I am in life and maybe it is for the best I just don't live anymore. I have nothing in this world to live for other than myself and even then I don't care to do that anymore. nothing in my life will get better. 

I applied for HUD housing and was supposed to move into my own apartment after 7 years of waiting on the list for over 40 hud housing I got accepted to one but I couldn't make it there as I had no money to get there or for first months rent, downpayment, or to have the lights turned on. 

I spent the past ten years trying to better my life but only to get knocked down every time I get up. For example. saved 3 to 4 years up to 3k and bought my first car then got scammed by the dealership. Resaved money up to 900 dollars then needed two teeth pulled which cost 450 each after tax which drained my 900 I had saved last month after almost a year of saving. Then I got called up for my first apartment ever and couldn't get there. 

Two years ago needed eye surgery to remove a cataract in my right eye and now need it done in my left eye but the Dr refuses and now Texas is doing this Real ID stuff where you need a star on your driver license and in order to do that I need an eye exam and I will most likely fail it and lose my driver license because of the cataract in my left eye so there goes the driver license and there goes getting a car to live in. 

Spent years trying to get my GED only to fail it every time I try. spent the past eight years in the dating scene only to get rejected by women over my weight and told I am worthless and have nothing to offer a relationship or just downright mocked at and laughed at over my weight.

I got the cataracts in my eyes from taking Androgel testosterone medication because I have very low testosterone and I am on thyroid meds because my thyroid is basically dead and when they gave the max dose I lost 45 lbs in 8 months with absolutely no changes to my diet or daily routine but then gained it back a year later..

I just literally can't take anymore of this crummy life and to the point of thinking death is a lot better than this and it is better to be dead than keep failing or being knocked down every time I try to do something with my life. 

I also suffer from CPTSD = Complex post traumatic Stress Disorder. I didn't serve just from things I been through in my life and childhood. I also suffer from Severe chronic depression, Severe social anxiety, severe abandonment issues, paranoia and learning issues. I have been diagnosed with them all. 

I have looked up issues with autism and self diagnosing that I may be borderline autistic as I have some of the same issues in that spectrum. I am just so tired of fighting and so tired of going through life like this barely being able to breath and barely being able to survive and have absolutely nothing to show for it.",t2_4cfx78jz,False,,0,False,Maybe its for the best that I don't live anymore,[],r/depression,False,0.0,,0,False,t3_fe5t8m,False,dark,,public,1,0,{},,False,[],,False,False,,{},,False,1,,False,,False,,[],{},,True,,1583486686.0,text,0.0,,,text,self.depression,False,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;I am almost 40, on disability morbidly obese and can&amp;#39;t lose weight no matter how hard I try.   I am almost 40, with nothing but a 500 dollar laptop that my neighbor gave me that is falling apart and only worth around 70 if that. a pair of shoes that are falling apart and hurt when I walk in them. about a dozen worn-out socks and a few shirts and pants all black. mostly sweat pants and two pairs of blue jeans and a worn-out wallet that is falling apart on me. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am on disability getting less than 800$ USD a month and have no educational background no GED was homeless for over 8 years and have bad teeth because of it. some need fixing and one needs a new crown. I wasn&amp;#39;t taught dental hygiene until I became homeless and even then brushing and flossing was the least of my worries. it was more of getting food and trying to survive. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I spent the past few years trying to get my GED and failed even with tutors and teachers and study groups found out I have learning issues that make it hard for me to get my GED and I basically have to go from the 2nd and 3rd grade to 12th grade in every subject.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have no family, no friends. I am utterly alone in this world. Bought a car two years ago was my first car and was planning on living in it but got scammed out of 3k. been trying to save again for another car to live in but been unable to. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Renting a bedroom from an elderly woman with bad health and she is going in for surgery today if she doesn&amp;#39;t make it I will be homeless again nowhere to live and unable to survive being homeless this time. My body has arthritis in my lower back, rheumatoid arthritis in my knees and feet. there&amp;#39;s days that I just can&amp;#39;t get out of bed because of it hurting so badly. there is no way I can survive being on the streets again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I feel like complete and utter crap especially compared to everyone else and now realizing how worthless I am in life and maybe it is for the best I just don&amp;#39;t live anymore. I have nothing in this world to live for other than myself and even then I don&amp;#39;t care to do that anymore. nothing in my life will get better. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I applied for HUD housing and was supposed to move into my own apartment after 7 years of waiting on the list for over 40 hud housing I got accepted to one but I couldn&amp;#39;t make it there as I had no money to get there or for first months rent, downpayment, or to have the lights turned on. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I spent the past ten years trying to better my life but only to get knocked down every time I get up. For example. saved 3 to 4 years up to 3k and bought my first car then got scammed by the dealership. Resaved money up to 900 dollars then needed two teeth pulled which cost 450 each after tax which drained my 900 I had saved last month after almost a year of saving. Then I got called up for my first apartment ever and couldn&amp;#39;t get there. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Two years ago needed eye surgery to remove a cataract in my right eye and now need it done in my left eye but the Dr refuses and now Texas is doing this Real ID stuff where you need a star on your driver license and in order to do that I need an eye exam and I will most likely fail it and lose my driver license because of the cataract in my left eye so there goes the driver license and there goes getting a car to live in. &lt;/p&gt;

,depression,"Hi, I wasn't sure where to post this since it relates to a relationship. I've dealt with depression since my early teen's. It continued to be a major problem in my life until about my mid 20s when I met my current partner. Because of how emotionally mature, supportive and trusting he was, I felt my espisodes we not as frequent or as severe. However as I began to hit my 30s, I started to notice the larger issues that I overlooked when I was younger as not important, like his finanical health (how he views money/saving). He holds a job with little responsibility and low-stress but pays as such (i.e. near minimum wage). He did work overtime for a time to afford a house, which he has but needs me to pay half the mortgage in order to afford it. He says I'm the love of his life but he's not interested in getting married. He's also almost nearly a decade older than me.

I feel trapped because as much as I love him, I want to leave. The major reasons I want to leave are different views towards finances, marriage and moving (he doesn't want to move away from where his parents live). I've been wanting to leave for a very long time but I'm also scared. This decision has caused my anxiety then depression to spring up full force, comptemplating suicide because I'd rather die than live on my own. I haven't lived on my own since my early 20s and every time I lived alone it would result in me being suicidal nearly every day. I struggled, graduated late in college and managed a business degree that did nothing, but earn me an unstable job history and act as a cover to people that I'm doing okay. I just realize how emotionally dependent I am on him and that scares me too. I have no family or friends to talk to about this or for any emotional support. I also hate the state I live in as there are many bad memories here of past abuse. My parents also live here and our relationship remains strained.

What I want is to move out of this city and start over but I don't know if that's my depression talking or what. I don't trust my own decisions or judgements. I have low esteem for myself and my choices. Back to the reasons for leaving my partner though---I feel like who am I to say what I want in a relationship since for instance, I can't even hold a steady job so again, makes it hard to leave him. I'm also currently in school again to once more try a job more suitable to my personality--massage. Until then, I'm stuck living with him for another 6 months.

How do you find the courage to live on your own? Past that, how do you find the will or care to live? I don't have anyone. I mean, I won't have anyone if I leave him and that scares me into staying with him too. Or should I just stay with him and work things out? I'm not sure. I just know I can't sleep well, don't eat much and been crying every other day. Sometimes I just would rather die than have to make a life decision...

Filmmaking has been literally the thing that shape who i am today.

One time I had a fever and I had to go to work this partner that I am wish was out and never came home, He didn&amp;#39;t check up on me and I haven&amp;#39;t heard from him. My plans most of the time has to be put on hold because my partner wants to take a nap and I have to be there most of the time. I want someone to love me and not hurt me anymore, I want hugs and kisses and cuddles and being spoiled alittle bit. My partner isnt the right now for me but I havent found the one for me and I am stuck because I am behind on rent and I am trying to built myself up again after going through some stuff of my own.&lt;/p&gt;

,depression,"This is a long text about what I'm dealing with.. just giving you a heads up.I hate embarrassing myself and I act in a way I dont like. I maybe acting in a way which balances all the embarrassments I deal with. 

I keep thinking about past moments where it's fucking embarrassing and then I hate to fight to being the person to desire to be. By embarrassing it means either people telling me on my face which hurts me and they know it but still choose to say it because they know Im boring now and I don't have the confidence they saw in me they used to. I'm on their side on this cuz I they are true. And I don't know how to help myself out of this. 

 To be honest I'm lonely like literally lonely only because of me. I'm not open about my feelings and try to just move the conversation about general things. I only love people but not give back anything or show it. Theres not a single person who I have a nice relationship with right now. I mean to say I don't have but they do. Few of my friends care about me and don't want me to get hurt but that's all. I don't like my family because I'm thinking like this just because of their conditioning . I hate my insecure mom who is highly egoistic of herself and can't handle rejection or appreciation she gets defensive for very small things and also expects me to show love to her and give the attention she needs all the time and if I don't do it she gets hurt again and gets defensive. I hate that she's like that and that's in me . That is my biggest problem because I have conversations in my head to fix her cuz I don't want her to be that way and I do this therapeutic talk all the time with her and me. Im starting to get sick of it and handle this. I know all the ways she can't get offended and it's not hard and it's my problem to deal with convincing her. I can't fucking do it I wanna leave her but I can't live with guilt she has given me till now that I can't live by knowing she's gonna get mental if I leave her. She has friends but they're cringe as fuck saying I love you or I hate you. All they talk about is that. She wants everything without deserving it. 

When I say all this about her I know that I act like her and when I say I hate her I hate the part of me that's her. That part of me is not leaving me. I try to give people guilt trips unconsciously or give them situations where I get rejected and I won't take it properly. This feeling of being alone after someone shows that they don't like me is what I want to feel but I want to say to mind that noone likes me and I'm alone. 

Today I truly feel like I don't have a friend to share any of my feelings to because it is truly cringe worthy and embarrassment because I feel like this. I have a lot of potential in me . I have great looks. Im smart. I'm talenting in coding. I'm very funny sometimes. But my ego which judges me and judges others gets all its data and fucks me over and convincing me to feel shitty and unmotivated all the time. 

I can't say these things to anyone I know and I'm always confused with the way I think I don't know what's a good thought or a bad thought because they have their own points which are opposite. Im conditioning and people are trying. To get rid of me because they don't like me anymore. I'm boring and I don't want to settle to this but I'm setting. I hate that this happening but not enough.

This is very general when I say people or feelings but this insecurity in a college environment. Everyone is different here and there only a few cool people. Every friend i know is a confident secure person and deals with Thier problems with friends together. I can't have that.

My personality is dead because of the shit thats in my head. The therapeutic talk. The polar opposite debates about feelings. Numbness. And living with the shitty version of myself.

,depression,"I'm 24 years old and have recently graduated from college with a BA in art. Art has been my passion since I was a little kid and I hope I can one day have an exhibition showcasing my art. 

So back in 2019 just a few months after graduating college I applied for this artists residence program. I knew that I probably wouldn't get accepted as these  residences are usually very popular and I was still buliding up my
career in art. But I still wanted to try and get more experienced in writing applications and though I'd give it a go and you never know I might just be lucky enough to be accepted. 
This particular application had to be sent in by post. So I asked my mum for a stamp. Later that day my dad sees the stamp booklet and asks what it was doing there. So my mum told him. He just conpleatly lost his shit and started yelling at my mum. He was arngry that my mum hadn't told him about my plans to apply for this residence. I could hear the yelling from my bedroom and came down to see what it was about. 

I can't remember everything that happened and what was said. But basically my dad felt that this was a terrible idea. That the residence wouldn't be good for me and that I shouldn't be moving out. 
I kept trying to explain how there were many benefits of doing this residence. And how I wouldn't be moving away forever. Besides I was 23 at the time. A lot of people my age had lived away from their parents. He, however, couldn't get his head around it. He thought the residence program wasn't legitimate. Despite the fact that I  found out about it through my college lectures and how they literally give us seminars on how to apply to these residences. 

He keep yelling and screaming causing my mum to cry and sleep in my sister's room that night. 

I didn't let the events of that night keep me from pursuing my dream. Fast forward to a few days ago and I'm working on another application for a artist residence. This one also has to be sent in by post. So this time I tell my dad what I'm doing just before he went to bed. He rolled his eyes but didn't say much. 
The next day I'm printing off my application and I can hear my dad speaking negativity about this residences to my mum.

My mum is so kind and loving and supportive of me and my dreams. I really couldn't ask more of her. 
Anyway. I come into the room and tell my dad that I can hear him talking about me. 
He says similar stuff to what he said back in 2019. How he's thinks its a bad idea. How he thinks I shouldn't be moving out. He is of the belief that I'm looking at this with rose tinted glasses. I try to explain how I'm not some stupid little kid just following some whimsical dream. This is my passion. Its the thing I have a degree in and very much plan on pursuing. 
 For some reason he cannot understand what a 
residence involves. I thought the team residence made it fairly obvious. However I try to explain how its a place you live and work in. So you can produce artwork in a proper studio. He's still just shaking his head saying its a bad idea. I ask him why he thinks its a bad idea but he just cuts me off and tells me to tell him why its a good idea.
Once again I try to explain the benefits. Because I'm just making small bits of Watercolour paintings in my bedroom and having a studio would be so much more ideal.
He stars asking questions about how they chose people. I explain about how you send in a cover letter, an artist cv, and images of your work.

For some reason he keeps referring to the residence as a course. My mum and I tell his how its not a course its a place to live and work. He doesn't seem to understand. 
He says how the only people who will benefit from this course are the people running in. 

He seems to believe that because I wouldn't be paid to attend this residence that its a waste of time. 
I'm not even asking my parents for money to fund this residence. I planned to pay the rent myself. 
The he says how I should be looking for work. He's a bit of a booomer. He seems to think that there's loads of jobs going round and I just couldn't be bothered to get one. Not true. 

I had a job not too long ago but it was temporary contract work which ended a few weeks ago. 

He has the nerve to say that when he, himself has been unemployed since the early 2000s and my mum is the main breadwinner.
 He just happens to be related to wealthy parents whom he inherited loads of money from when they died. He doesn't know the struggle of looking for work or having a strict budget. 
I asked if he'd prefer if i were in some dead end job that made me miserable. No he says. He'd like to see me in a job that makes me happy. And he sort of suggests to continue with art on the side but apparently working and doing an art residence is just too much. 

Anyway, getting back on track. He mentioned how he thinks I'm too vulnerable and not ready to move out. I don't know how he's going to react when I have enough money saved up to move out. But he can't stop me from moving out and living my own life. I haven't even been accepted by the residence program and he's acting as if I'm leaving to live on the other side of the world.
Everything up to this point has been very upsetting and stressful and depressing. But than he goes and says that I'm not good enough or talented enough. Thst these no future in this residences. No future in art. 

That fucking hurt but I highly suspected this. I told him that I already knew that. This man hasn't even seen half of my art. Hasn't see what I'm capable of doing. And doesn't understand how the art world works. If I were bad I wouldn't have gotten my BA. It's still so hard to not let his words get to me. I'm still planning on applying for open calls to residences and exhibitions. I know i have talent and I work hard. Even if I'm not currently good enough that doesn't mean I should stop. The only thing that will stop me from having a future in art is if I give up. So I won't give up until I have made it.",t2_4voolokv,False,,0,False,Asshole dad doesn't support my dreams.

,depression,"Okay so I have absolutely no one to talk to, so forgive me for ranting here and making little to no sense. I just really need to get things off my chest. 

I really want to die. I’ve reached the point where I would be fine with a car crashing into mine and killing me, or being shot, or getting a terminal illness; I’m not picky over how I die, I just want to vanish from Earth. And I’m too much of a coward to do it myself, though I think about it all the time. My family has grown attached to me, despite the fact that they used to hate my guts during my teenage years. I fixed my relationship with them, and I know dying would hurt them but I’m a selfish idiot. 

I recently started college and it’s awful. I used to be a great student in high school, the type of student teachers praise by saying they have a great future ahead of them. But along the way I fucked up. I feel dumber and dumber each day, I see my classmates learning quick while I struggle to understand a simple class. I can barely finish assignments on time and each day I find less reasons to finish them. I fear failing my classes, I’ve never failed one before but at the rate this is going I probably will. My family has put so many high expectations on me, and I’ve always known I would never meet them. 
I’m not even studying what I wanted because my mother disapproved of my original career choice. I wanted to study physics, but she made me study electronic engineering. 
The firsts exams were awful, I know I still have time to recover from my pitifully mediocre scores but I seriously doubt I will. 

I have no friends, my personality is awful and I never learned how to talk to people, I’m too awkward. I’m also incredibly hideous and fat, there’s nothing I like about myself. I absolutely loathe everything about myself. There’s no redeeming quality about me. I used to think I was smart but it’s clear I’m a dumb idiot that never should had been born. I wish my mother aborted me when she had the chance. I’m just a fucking waste of space. 

I can’t even cry anymore. Hell, I don’t even feel anything most of the time. I’m just numb, but sometimes I feel dread settle over me and not leave for days. I’m an useless, worthless piece of shit. I know that. I just want to disappear. I hope to fall asleep and never wake up. 
My birthday is in two days but I don’t think I can handle turning eighteen years old, I know not much will change but I can’t just keep living.

I just really need to get things off my chest. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I really want to die. I’ve reached the point where I would be fine with a car crashing into mine and killing me, or being shot, or getting a terminal illness; I’m not picky over how I die, I just want to vanish from Earth. And I’m too much of a coward to do it myself, though I think about it all the time. My family has grown attached to me, despite the fact that they used to hate my guts during my teenage years. I fixed my relationship with them, and I know dying would hurt them but I’m a selfish idiot. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I recently started college and it’s awful. I used to be a great student in high school, the type of student teachers praise by saying they have a great future ahead of them. But along the way I fucked up. I feel dumber and dumber each day, I see my classmates learning quick while I struggle to understand a simple class. I can barely finish assignments on time and each day I find less reasons to finish them. I fear failing my classes, I’ve never failed one before but at the rate this is going I probably will. My family has put so many high expectations on me, and I’ve always known I would never meet them. 
I’m not even studying what I wanted because my mother disapproved of my original career choice. I wanted to study physics, but she made me study electronic engineering. 
The firsts exams were awful, I know I still have time to recover from my pitifully mediocre scores but I seriously doubt I will. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have no friends, my personality is awful and I never learned how to talk to people, I’m too awkward. I’m also incredibly hideous and fat, there’s nothing I like about myself. I absolutely loathe everything about myself. There’s no redeeming quality about me. I used to think I was smart but it’s clear I’m a dumb idiot that never should had been born. I wish my mother aborted me when she had the chance. I’m just a fucking waste of space. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I can’t even cry anymore. Hell, I don’t even feel anything most of the time. I’m just numb, but sometimes I feel dread settle over me and not leave for days. I’m an useless, worthless piece of shit. I know that. I just want to disappear. I hope to fall asleep and never wake up. 
My birthday is in two days but I don’t think I can handle turning eighteen years old, I know not much will change but I can’t just keep living. Each day feels like torture, getting out of my bed takes too much of me and falling asleep is too difficult. I’m just really fucking tired all the time, no matter how much I sleep. &lt;/p&gt;

Bit backstory: my girlfriend and I recently broke up. It was something out of our control and I don’t blame her or hate her for it, but it meant upending my life and moving 300 miles away and back in with my parents after 7 years of being in my relationship and being independent. I left my life and my cats behind, they were basically holding me together at the time. I lost my job in September and have had a really hard time finding work. So as you can imagine I’m feeling pretty low right now. 

The main issue: my mother and I have never really gotten along. She’s unpleasant to be around for long periods of time. Fine in small doses though. She basically shits on everything I do or try to do. There’s always something negative that she brings to the equation that takes the wind out of my sails. 

I went for a job interview last week, it went okay. Wasn’t great, wasn’t terrible. I was confident that I was on the border of getting it. I got the rejection email this afternoon. It felt like I got kicked in the stomach by a shire horse. It was an awful feeling being knocked back. I applied for 43 jobs and that was my only interview and I didn’t get it. I was feeling pretty bad, then my mum came in to the room. She decided now was a good time to ask “what would you do if you didn’t have me and your dad to feed you and keep you?” A pleasant topic of conversation. I said, “well, I’d be homeless and sleeping rough I’d imagine mum.” She didn’t seem satisfied by this response and decided to go on a tirade about how I should seek unemployment benefits and such. Which I would, but my last ounce of pride won’t let me. I should also mention that I haven’t asked for a penny of charity from her since I got back. Anything she and my dad have paid for is listed on my phone and I fully intend on paying her back when I’m working or have some money coming in. I haven’t loaned money from my mum since I was at uni. Not because I didn’t need the help, I just couldn’t handle the arguing anymore. My sister however, currently owes my mum and dad thousands and they don’t chase her for it. Whenever she needs help they drop what they are doing to help her. I don’t know if I’m just bitter about that because my mum makes the statement “we treat you both the same” all the time, but I know they don’t. 

She continued to twist the knife until I couldn’t take it anymore and just walked out of the room. 

I should say, that she doesn’t seem to mind having me around when a delivery is coming and she wants to go and see a friend, or when I make lunch and dinner, or when I do housework. I feel like a should help out around the house where I can. Most of the time it’s not good enough for her, but at least I tried. 

After all of this I’m just left with this feeling of uselessness and that I’ll never be good enough.

I’m 25, F and live in eastern Canada. I live in a small town where more people here fake being ill to get out of work or have other habits.

I’ve been suffering from depression for as long as I can remember being alive. I was first fully aware that I wanted to die since I was 6, I’ve begged for it every day of my life since then and every birthday, that’s what I wished for; even til this very day. 



I’ve been going to a doctor in my town to continue working on my depression, she prescribed me medication which started to make my state worse by an increased amount of suicidal thoughts, more flashbacks, and now irritation as well as mood swings. I’ve been diagnosed with PTSD, Dysthymia and Anxiety. I’m constantly trying to make it a point to address to every doctor I’ve been to in the past 8 years that I literally hate being alive and I’ve even been honest as to how many times in a span of a year Ive tried to commit suicide, even up to date. I’ve tried signing myself into our local hospital to try to be admitted to get real help and they’ve only ever kept me for a night each time. Ive begged to stay and I’m still sent home since I seem calm. 

I have always acted like I was fine in front of people since I was raised that it was not okay to be depressed or show negative emotions as I had an abusive mother. Because of that, I can’t express sadness normally, instead I just seem calm and most thing I’m being sarcastic or trying to be funny. I don’t openly cry in front of others since I honestly hate people seeing me cry when I’m a support figure for a lot of people I know. 


I’ve tried making appointments with psychiatrists (we don’t have psychologists at our hospital, they’re hours away and I can’t drive), but they often push Ativan which doesn’t react well with me.

It’s sad to see depression hold me down. If I need to be happy I need to change something. I hate taking meds and being on a schedule. People are gonna treat me different if they find out. My dumb arrogant self also lashed out at my girl best friend. I think she hates me. I said sorry like a million times, I wrote paragraphs to get her to forgive me.

She said if she can get a hug but she still won’t talk to me in class, hallways, or over text. Her reason is she doesn’t like getting personal. And she’s told me in the past she’s had family problems, so I know she’s stressed. I don’t know if I’m annoying her but I’m keeping positive vibes. Just today one of my “friends” with ADHD said his friend was gonna give him a gun and shoot two teachers. I trust one of my gym teachers the most in the school, more than my family. I mean the guys gone through it. I had him for class a year ago, and in that same year he was divorced. He knows depression and stress. Anyways I told him and he thanked me a bunch. I think he’s speculated I have depression, he’s a health teacher and I always talk to him so I know he knows somethings off. He sent me to the VP and told him the story. They both basically hailed me for keeping the school safe. And I’m grateful. I like being reminded people care for me, I just don’t see it. And neither do you probably.

,depression,"   Well, I’ve been thinking about posting on here and you know what? Today I’m just going to do it. I’ve been feeling abnormally sad for almost five years now. I’ve never gone to get clinically diagnosed with depression so I won’t say I have it-but after having some dark thoughts these past three years...I won’t deny it if that ends up being the case.
   I have always had a small group of friends, and that circle is down to three. Out of those three friends, I have had one since 1st grade. After a mess up on my part (that happened almost three years ago), we haven’t been as close as we once were. We don’t share emotional things anymore. But we do laugh and joke a lot. That’s mainly what our friendship is now. We only talk when we see one another, and if we contact each other over text-she usually finds a way to cut the conversation short. I know I’m loosing her. It hurts but I know she will find someone better than me to be by her side....
   I have a second friend, she’s been my friend since 6th grade. I don’t feel like I’m loosing her as much as the others-but life issues are getting in the way of me seeing her so we haven’t been able to talk much-if at all...
  And my last-perhaps my closest friend now, just admitted today that he doesn’t believe in the whole ‘friendship’ ordeal. He said that he believes none of his friends actually like him-and he said that right to my face today. He’s detached from people, and when he thinks people don’t care about him...he doesn’t care about them. On top of that he’s been really distant lately, and we don’t have the deep conversations like we did in the past. When we talk it’s about nothing in particular and it hurts the most seeing him go because he’s always been there for me during my super low times. In response to what he said, I promised him that I would never stop trying to show him that I cared for him, but he brushed me off and said have fun trying.
   I feel like I’m loosing my friends slowly. I don’t talk to anyone anymore. I feel alone. I hate going out into public because that reminds me of how people have friends...when mine are slowly fading. I don’t know what to do anymore. They are the reason I’ve been pushing through-and the reason I have pushed through in these past five years. I don’t know what to do.
   I can’t talk to them because they aren’t very emotional, and the one that is (the one that I haven’t been able to see due to life issues) doesn’t deserve this type of weight on her shoulders. I guess this is just more of a vent to get this off my shoulders. I could go on and on about so many different things but...this is the one that has been killing me as of lately.

,depression,"I haven't been sleeping much lately, I wake up with heavy drowsiness, despite not being able to fall asleep. I don't want to continue like this, I don't want to live if this is what life is.

My daily thoughts are riddled with shame, regret, disappointment, anger, and worry. There is so much I wish I had done differently, or not at all. I don't talk to anyone about it because no one would quite understand. It is much easier said than done to not compare oneself to others, forgive, or move on from the past. I haven't lived a day of my life at the age of 25 because of my circumstances and poor decision making.

I feel helpless and powerless. The world is hostile, overly competitive, and parasitic. The deluded turn to their illusions of grandeur via religion, but no loving god would allow this atrocity of a world. I don't feel I have a place that I belong

I wish I had made friends sooner, I don't have anyone now and I feel that I am just a burden. I wish I had gotten a job instead of letting myself be pressured into post secondary education, I have no money or direction now and I feel that I am a failure. I wish I had stood up for myself in bad relationships, I don't have any self respect now and I feel that I am a weak loser. I wish I had matured sooner, I am very far behind in life and I feel that I cannot catch up. I wish I had any confidence in myself, I am convinced that it is too late to make anything worthwhile because the foundations of my life are rotten and building on rotten foundation is recipe for disaster.

I wish I had a better family, a better community, a better world to live in, and I wish I was a better person. No matter what anyone says, I don't believe much can change.

I'm not like others, I wish I was. I can't use social media at all because it floors me to see others doing things I wanted to do, and seeing the results of the better choices they made.

,depression,"I was bullied for most of my school life. It started to get better at around 11th grade. Before that I have never really experianced girls that were nice to me. But for as long as I can think I have been dreaming about the soft touch of a woman. Not sexually but just being hugged. Or snuggling. Now at the end of 10th grade I started self-improving like theres no tomorrow. And it went uphill for me real quick. I started to work out daily, started fighting sports, joined the volunteer firefighters, volunteer wildlandfirefighters and recently sent out my application for the german red cross. It all went well exept one thing. I still wanted a girl to like me. Now more than ever before after I finished firefighting training and had my first ""psychologically demanding"" firecalls. Sometimes I just come home and wish that a girl would just come out of nowhere and hug me. I am still a kissless virgin even though from the outside I may even be desireable. At least thats what some people tell me. But because most of my life there weren't really any girls that were nice to me, I interpret every single nice thing from a girl as some kind of flirt. Then I get feelings for almost every single girl there was. They could be as bitchy as anything but as long as they're a woman, I would develop feelings for her and make advances. Openly flirting with almost every girl I knew. I was sort of known as the needy guy. Some people told me and I slowly realised that I had no chance with girls if I act like this. Then one of my ""favorite crushes"" (there are a lot of them) had a long talk to me. I told her how I felt about my needyness and my past. She told me I dont have any chance with her (she told me before) but that if I stopped thinking about girls all the time then maybe someone would actually turn up. That was the first time I really talked to someone about my problem and it was devastating. I couldn't stop thinking about women. For years when I'm home alone I'd pretend that there was a girl in my bed. Asking how ""her"" day was, making out with the pillow and everything. Sometimes at dinner I would put two plates on the table and just talk with ""her"" about ""her"" day. I didn't know how to help myself and because of all my volunteering work and sports I don't have time for a therapist. So then I had the idea of punishing myself if I'd think about women. And with no other ideas I started doing that. Every day I'd take my leather belt, take off my top and start belting away at my back. I'd take my phone and turn on porn and start belting myself so I would stop getting an erection when something sexual happens. At school and volunteering work I'd pinch my trizeps real hard whenever I'd think about women or would look at a girls butt or breasts. Now everytime I see a girl I'd just catch a glimpse of her and quickly look away. In the beginning it helped. I stopped thinking about girls. But after some time I was on edge all the time. Hurting myself at the slightest thought of someone. I'd look at women at firecalls or when I otherwise needed to. But otherwise I'd look away. And now it just hurts. My confidence has plumeted.

,depression,"Hi, depression is something I’ve been dealing with off and on for at least 15 years. I’m 33 married with two young kids, I come from a family with parents who want to be supportive but do not really understand depression and mental health problems. It’s made worse by the fact my two younger siblings are already more accomplished than I am. Anyways I’ve been in therapy 3 times over the last 15 years and quite honestly it’s been a disaster each time, I’m to the point where I no longer believe in psychotherapy as a legitimate means to help myself.

This recent bout has started late October and has been moving into the severe, life affecting depression the last two months. It’s made much worse by having to look my wife and precious children in the eyes everyday knowing I’m failing them. My wonderful children 2.5 and 1 year old bring me so much joy but then so much anxiety that I am failing them, wasting my life in a malaise with no real impending problems. 

Probably the worst part is people who know me but don’t live with me would never know this, even when depressed I can fake it in social situations and I would say people think I’m funny, personable and when I’m not depressed I have a keen mind and have had some mild success in business or other endeavors. So people would be shocked to read or hear how tortured I feel mentally. 

Like an idiot I fell into old traps, trying to just “take the edge off” with a couple drinks in the morning just to get through the tough times, Which the veteran depressed reading this will be shaking their heads knowing how much worse that makes it. Luckily I recognized it early enough and cut it out cold turkey and haven’t had a sip in 10 days or so. Right now I just need some inertia to get out the door, run my small business and provide for them. Today is the worst I’ve felt in years, paralyzed by my demons, it’s absolute agony. 

Becoming a father has been the best thing that’s ever happened to me, but if I fail my children and wife I’ll never ever forgive myself. I need to face things head on but it’s that fear of what damage I’ve done the last few months being negligent and having to once again dig myself out of this hole. You see I know more major bouts of depression are in my future but I worry how many more recoveries I have in me, I make life so hard on myself with the inconsistencies, it’s such torture.

I have run into 2 major problems in my life atm, it has been eating away at me for the better part of a month. I’ll give you some backstory:

I have people pleaser all my life. I feel like I have always gone with the flow, with people’s expectations of me rather than have my own. I have done that since I was a kid and I’m now turning 20 this year, And with that being said the first problem I have run into is, I don’t know what I want and like partly due to the depression. But mostly due to the fact that I’ve never really done or said what I wanted to to outside forces shutting me down at every turn (school, parents etc.). Idk and it’s driving me up a wall.


2: I thought hard about the people pleaser trait in my being a lot and I have come to this conclusion, I hate who I am. I believe that I am selfish and feel because I haven’t done what I have wanted in my life I am inauthentic. So I go and look for outside validation and love because I feel like I am incapable of it. But when I receive it, and it doesn’t hit the way I wanted it to or things are too fast or far. Like a addict I dump them and look for a new person to give me that feeling I long for. It’s fucked up, because the other people care about me and I do to to an extent, but I prioritize my own feelings and shit first. And that realization fucked me up so bad. Real bad.

,depression,"This is going to be a long post because i have a lot to say, sorry in advance.

 I dont see any way my life can get on track, I'm 23 years old, i have achieved nothing noteworthy in life and i've generally lived a life of isolation, this stems all the way back from secondary school where i was relentlessly bullied for being black and overweight, i was only 11 years old when i first got diagnosed with depression because of the sheltered life i had lived before then meant i had no idea what people would be like once i got to high school, no one told me that being black was something that people may not like, no one told me that being overweight would be something kids would make fun of, but it happened, for 4 years straight, throughout high school i ran into various obstacles i'd never want a kid to go through, almost weekly fights, bad report cards and parents evenings lead to detentions and 3 day exclusions which lead to me starting to simply skip school and not go, i tried so hard to get myself kicked out of that school because my mother would not take me out of the school, i didnt understand why then and i still dont understand now and i think part of me resents her for that to this day, i truly believe my life could have been so different if i didnt get forced to stay at the school that almost killed me multiple times. 

The bullying definitely subsided a touch in the last year, with kids wanting to get into good 6th forms they started looking to just finishing their exams i guess? But the damage was already done, i started school a pretty normal happy kid with a fair few friends who didnt think about much besides what pokemon i needed to catch to fill my national dex or if i the cartoon i wanted to watch was recorded but by my last year i was could barely be bothered to do anything, i didnt talk to anyone i simply went to school and got the bus home and avoided people at all costs, i had skipped way too much school to get good grades and i could motivate myself to want to study, i was getting the bare minimum to get into 6th form and hopefully that was enough to scrape by. But as if things wern't bad enough i went on a residential school trip with one of my classes that was cut short because I ended up having a severe athsma attack when we got the the accommodation camp, this was my first time having an athsma attack and my first time i'd have ever been to hospital and i was only 15 so my first feelings were obviously of extreme panic, a small part of me i'd say was honestly relieved, maybe this was the end and i wouldnt have to go on, the ambulance got there and i must have asked the responded a hundred times if i was going to die, obviously she cant tell a child 'probably' so she said no and was comforting me, the ride to the hospital felt like an eternity. To wrap this part up obviously i didnt die but i had woken up a week later in the icu surrounded by my family, it was weird seeing my dad and mum together as well as their partners because they had been split up for a long time but i was just happy i woke up i guess. I had to stay in hospital for a few days more after i woke up for tests and rehab, getting used to walking again after being in bed for a week was interesting and a lot harder than i ever thought it would be, i was told that people who suffer acute asthma attacks generally have a low survival rate, i cant remember the exact number but it was low enough to cause a reaction from everyone. We left the hospital and i was told i wouldnt be able to go back to school for at least a month, obviously any kid would be thrilled to hear that but i was super happy because it meant time away from hell on earth. 

However the recovery process during that month kind of set the precedent for a hole i got trapped in and am still trapped in, doing nothing for a month meant i got into some pretty lazy habits but also i got used to being on my own world just playing xbox and watching tv during the day. Transitioning back into school life was harder than anticipated because it was half days to start off with and that was for about 2 weeks. Fast forward a bit and the bullying starts again because fuck it why not bully the kid fresh out of hospital right? it gets to exam period and i have full on sacked off school, i skip most days and get put into the assisted education program where you take exams in a different room and have a personal TA and some counselling sessions, of course none of this really helped me because i just didnt have any care for my education i just wanted away from school asap. I by some miracle without studying at all managed to scrape by with enough GCSE qualifications to go to 6th form on the condition that i would have to take english and maths alongside a foundation year. This leads onto my next problem:

For more reasons unknown to me which i can only chalk up to she cant be bothered, my mum decided for me that i wasnt going to go to a college in my hometown, i would have to instead go to live with my dad and do my 3 years of college there. Now i should probably explain why this is a problem, my dad and I dont get on well, we havent for as long as i stopped being a child and we still have barely any real relationship, i just talk to him like once a month to talk to my little brother and sister who obviously i have no reason to not have a relationship with. I wont go into as much detail here because this post is already feeling too long but theres so much more to get through. Long story short my dad was extremely emotionally abusive, anything that he didnt like would be met with screaming banging on things and threats of physical violence, this would be for anything from not doing the dishes to not studying earlier than what was on my plan. This again warped my view of education because i wasnt really doing courses i enjoyed but rather what was available to me and i didnt feel inspired to commit to it by studying, most of my study time was just sneaking my phone on silent. This went on for 3 years straight, i was isolated, the only person i really interacted with was my abusive dad and my teachers and classmates when i had to. When i tried to confide in my mother she simply told me other people including herself had it worse and hes just strict and does it because he cares about me and wants whats best. So i gave up on that as well. Throughout my life one of the few things i really enjoyed was playing video games and I used it as an escape to just ignore my real life situation and responsibilities, how healthy that is is up for debate but if i didnt have that escape who knows if i'd even be typing this here now. He didn't like that i played video games because he said that it was pointless and took away time i could be studying or looking for work, so he took it away and never let me have it back on any occasion after half of the first year. 

Thats when things got really bad for me, without something to pass the time and take my mind off of things my depression and suicidal tendencies came flooding back, i started self harming and i still look at the scars along my arms sometimes and get reminded of how bad things were back then, i never thought that they would still be there 6 years later, i wish i had thought about that. Somehow 3 years later again without really putting in any effort i managed to complete my A levels and get enough points to get into University. on a foundation entry degree, I guess this was when i was happiest because i was finally free from my parents and maybe i could be someone new and different, I never would have imagined myself where I am now 4 years ago.

Uni life started off fine, i was still avoiding people and keeping to myself but a couple of people on my course would always sit next to me and try to talk to me, I guess because seeing someone sitting on their own in their first year of Uni made them want to include me so i even managed to have friends, the first year had some hardships because i was never taught how to budget or be independent so of course money got tight towards the end but aside from that i don't think my first year had any issues, i passed without any issues and found myself advancing to the first year of the actual degree. I wont go into detail for every year but i'll just say that apart from the odd times we'd go out together I still mostly stayed in my flat playing games or watching stuff online, I didnt party and I didnt study, I just kind of drifted, then for whatever reason i cannot remember i got into an argument with my mum, i cant remember what about but she sent me a message saying that she was done with me and i didnt really know what to feel, I just kind of stopped, I stopped going to uni, i stopped going out i stopped everything, i just started spending every day waking up, playing games and eating junk food, sleep, repeat. As you can imagine having a lifestyle like this really did a number on my mental and physical health. I would go an entire week without showering sometimes more, my only human contact was taking my food from downstairs, this was my lowest point. 

Obviously i failed the year because i didnt attend or do all the work. The next year i was allowed to stay at the Uni and take up a different course, thinking that i could just power through it, but apparently during all of this student finance (the company that pays your tuition fees) turned around and said they wouldn't fund this year of learning for me, which obviously kind of fucked me over completely. Because they told me I wouldn't be funded i decided that there was no point in going, because i certainly don't have 9k just laying around to pay the fees myself, I didn't attend a single lecture all year and lived the same unhealthy life i had lived towards the end of the previous year for the entire year, it was horrible. The one beacon of hope that i could find was that eventually i had to start benefits as i didnt get money to pay the rent or anything so that covered that, meanwhile there was a local game store that ran a tournament for the game a play and i really enjoyed going to that once a week and made friends with the team i was assigned to, my life finally felt like it had some form of normality, i had a decent friend group, i was finally going out and i had something to look forward to whilst i tried to find proper work to fill my time and move into my own place, but unfortunately i couldnt find work and it came time to decide what i was going to do next in the summer, at this time i had another argument with my mum because she began to catch on that clearly something was wrong and i didnt want to go to university and do a degree i had no interest in.

We hadn't spoken in almost a month and i was sure we had cut ties but then she messaged me pleading me to come to an open day for a course that did in all honestly sound extremely appealing to me so i went and the place seemed nice and this where I am now, i got onto the course and i'm currently here now in the same situation but worse that i was in for the 3rd year at the previous uni, i havent attended almost any of the classes i'm almost certainly going to be kicked out or have to retake the year, but thats not even the worst part, the worst part is that i'm still being asked to pay for other years that i was told would be funded including this year, meaning i'm in an insane amount of debt with no way to pay it off, this year also isn't being funded despite being told it would be and i'm currently in negative balance in my bank account with the next payment of my underfunded maintenance loan coming in on the 20th of next month, i havent eaten in 3 days already and i dont feel all that good, my parents aren't an option and i have tried to ask for help in the loans/assistance reddits but i got marked as a scammer because i wasn't getting any replies but kept trying, I don't know what to do, I think I am well and truly ready for the end, I don't see how I can recover from this hole i put myself into, I'm 23 years old, with no degree, debt, no work experience meaning i cant get any jobs despite the 100's of applications i've probably sent off by now, i've never had a romantic partner, hell i've never even had a real best friend, i'm completely alone and I don't think anyone will miss me when i'm gone.

,depression,"How do I say that I want to lay in bed all day and do nothing? How could I convey to my parents that not wanting to exist is one of few thoughts that I have? I don't want to work, but still my parents force me to, I know this might sound as if I'm lazy. And I am, no doubt in that. 

Tbh I didn't ask to be born, let alone grow up to do stuff that I'm not interested in. If I were to have my dream job, I'd work on it in my pace, but obviously that isn't how it works.

I always come to work, most of the time I'm late, 10-20 mins but I still arrive and work. 

Now I want to run away, cuz I'm tired of them complaining about how I always sleep or that I'm lazy and do nothing all day, that I'm always in my room and not check in on them. That I can't smoke weed to cope with my thoughts.

We only get one life. One. I don't want to spend that time thinking about suicide, and then complain in my head about the options and how painful or too fast it's going to be. 

I don't want to run away, but most of our time we've been together all I hear is an in depth negative comment of how my life is, and contrast to a simple ""I love you."" I do get ""how are you feeling today?"" Or ""what are you up to today?"" But I can't say anything with honesty cuz then they'll start to ask questions that I can't answer without breaking down and shit. 

I almost don't care about family and friends. But I think one fateful day, I'll make that irrational decision and run away. I really am tired of listening to the implications of how bad my life is, and I don't want to hear it anymore.

How could I convey to my parents that not wanting to exist is one of few thoughts that I have? I don&amp;#39;t want to work, but still my parents force me to, I know this might sound as if I&amp;#39;m lazy. And I am, no doubt in that. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tbh I didn&amp;#39;t ask to be born, let alone grow up to do stuff that I&amp;#39;m not interested in. If I were to have my dream job, I&amp;#39;d work on it in my pace, but obviously that isn&amp;#39;t how it works.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I always come to work, most of the time I&amp;#39;m late, 10-20 mins but I still arrive and work. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now I want to run away, cuz I&amp;#39;m tired of them complaining about how I always sleep or that I&amp;#39;m lazy and do nothing all day, that I&amp;#39;m always in my room and not check in on them. That I can&amp;#39;t smoke weed to cope with my thoughts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We only get one life. One. I don&amp;#39;t want to spend that time thinking about suicide, and then complain in my head about the options and how painful or too fast it&amp;#39;s going to be. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#39;t want to run away, but most of our time we&amp;#39;ve been together all I hear is an in depth negative comment of how my life is, and contrast to a simple &amp;quot;I love you.&amp;quot; I do get &amp;quot;how are you feeling today?&amp;quot; Or &amp;quot;what are you up to today?&amp;quot; But I can&amp;#39;t say anything with honesty cuz then they&amp;#39;ll start to ask questions that I can&amp;#39;t answer without breaking down and shit. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I almost don&amp;#39;t care about family and friends. But I think one fateful day, I&amp;#39;ll make that irrational decision and run away. I really am tired of listening to the implications of how bad my life is, and I don&amp;#39;t want to hear it anymore.

,depression,"The last couple of months    ,             I've been tired . 

 I wanna die. Really badly. I don't wan't to cause the people that somehow still love me this pain, they need me here. But I am just so tired, so fucking tired.  I'm tired of this sad, mean, world. I feel like I can succeed, but I don't see the point if I still will not be happy. On the other hand I get the point, try to make family happy, and spend the little time we have with the ones we love. Someone of you may say, ""at least you are lucky you have people that love you this much"", and that is true. If it wasn't for them, I would not be here a long time ago. However, perhaps the feeling that brings within me the most pain and sorrow is: what if that love is not reciprocated? Don't get me wrong, I love these people. But I don't love spending time with anyone. I don't even love spending time by myself. I don't know what I want or what will make my day better. The thought of going through the same cycles of just trying to find some little piece of happy in the day for me and my loved ones for the rest of my life makes me not want to live through it. I find the bad in every activity, see the negative flaw of every person, while at the same time try to keep 'face' as much as possible. I think I can summarize this feeling into: I feel guilty for the pain that I cause my loved ones, but at the same time I am so fucking selfish. I just can't take it anymore. I feel like I am loosing my shit, I don't even know if I am depressed, crazy, bipolar, i don;t know. It just hurts. I want it to stop. \*I wanted better for myself

&amp;#x200B;

Overall, I don't know why I am writing this. 

I don't even want any help or input{

I just want this sadness to go way, I can't go around another day with my head down and my eyes filled with tears. I just feel like I wasn't born to act like this, I wanted to be strong physically and mentally in order to provide for my loved ones, not tear them down with my negativity. 

everyone problem is bigger than mine. I am just a selfish bitch who is too much of a pussy to deal with his own fucking emotions. There are people in this world who have gotten a much shittier hand. yet here i am fucking wanting to die. how does this make any sense?

It's also really hard to hide being so fucking sad; I am 6'6, live with my loving girlfriend, and trying to be social in years when I still had hope means there are still people who think I want friends in my life that try to reach out once in a while. Only to receive an excuse/ insult/ rambling when I try to avoid them. 

&amp;#x200B;

No matter how much effort I put into happiness, I can't seem to get close without cheating. Sure, some things make me happy, but as soon as they do, my mind almost tries to find the negative in the situation. 

&amp;#x200B;

To end this shit, I wanna make a wish.   
I wish for the kids who have to be strong, to have bull sized balls, and help every person in need. 

Because the false sense of protection is the last thing that they need. 

If you can't do it, don't say you can. Because when you don't, or aren't here, they will stay behind wondering why you every left.

Years of avoiding signals to get help can lead to a breaking point if the person isn't strong mentally, like me.",[],r/depression,False,0.0,,0,False,t3_fdsin9,False,dark,,public,6,0,{},,False,[],,False,False,,{},,False,6,,False,,False,,[],{},,True,,1583427213.0,text,0.0,,,text,self.depression,False,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;The last couple of months    ,             I&amp;#39;ve been tired . &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I wanna die. Really badly. I don&amp;#39;t wan&amp;#39;t to cause the people that somehow still love me this pain, they need me here. But I am just so tired, so fucking tired.  I&amp;#39;m tired of this sad, mean, world. I feel like I can succeed, but I don&amp;#39;t see the point if I still will not be happy. On the other hand I get the point, try to make family happy, and spend the little time we have with the ones we love. Someone of you may say, &amp;quot;at least you are lucky you have people that love you this much&amp;quot;, and that is true. If it wasn&amp;#39;t for them, I would not be here a long time ago. However, perhaps the feeling that brings within me the most pain and sorrow is: what if that love is not reciprocated? Don&amp;#39;t get me wrong, I love these people. But I don&amp;#39;t love spending time with anyone. I don&amp;#39;t even love spending time by myself. I don&amp;#39;t know what I want or what will make my day better. The thought of going through the same cycles of just trying to find some little piece of happy in the day for me and my loved ones for the rest of my life makes me not want to live through it. I find the bad in every activity, see the negative flaw of every person, while at the same time try to keep &amp;#39;face&amp;#39; as much as possible. I think I can summarize this feeling into: I feel guilty for the pain that I cause my loved ones, but at the same time I am so fucking selfish. I just can&amp;#39;t take it anymore. I feel like I am loosing my shit, I don&amp;#39;t even know if I am depressed, crazy, bipolar, i don;t know. It just hurts. I want it to stop. *I wanted better for myself&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Overall, I don&amp;#39;t know why I am writing this. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#39;t even want any help or input{&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I just want this sadness to go way, I can&amp;#39;t go around another day with my head down and my eyes filled with tears. I just feel like I wasn&amp;#39;t born to act like this, I wanted to be strong physically and mentally in order to provide for my loved ones, not tear them down with my negativity. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;everyone problem is bigger than mine. I am just a selfish bitch who is too much of a pussy to deal with his own fucking emotions. There are people in this world who have gotten a much shittier hand. yet here i am fucking wanting to die. how does this make any sense?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s also really hard to hide being so fucking sad; I am 6&amp;#39;6, live with my loving girlfriend, and trying to be social in years when I still had hope means there are still people who think I want friends in my life that try to reach out once in a while. Only to receive an excuse/ insult/ rambling when I try to avoid them. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No matter how much effort I put into happiness, I can&amp;#39;t seem to get close without cheating. Sure, some things make me happy, but as soon as they do, my mind almost tries to find the negative in the situation. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To end this shit, I wanna make a wish.&lt;br/&gt;
I wish for the kids who have to be strong, to have bull sized balls, and help every person in need. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because the false sense of protection is the last thing that they need. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you can&amp;#39;t do it, don&amp;#39;t say you can. Because when you don&amp;#39;t, or aren&amp;#39;t here, they will stay behind wondering why you every left. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Stay strong everyone, &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am ok with being weak, I already have been for years. This will just be the nail in the coffin.&lt;/p&gt;

You are not alone. And whoever you believe yourself to be right now that is not true. remember the person you were when you were fine, happy, in a better place. Feel it, embody that. I know that I am holding on to it. And if life has been mostly dark it helps to believe that experiences of happiness and joy exist somewhere outside of this state...just like Martin Luther king believed in his dreams even at that particular time it seemed impossible.

I do not know what caused you to land hard in this state, for me it was relationship loss, failure, deep loneliness and isolation-I have no family and lost my relationship/friendships to depression- people left-, though life circumstances (financial issues/living environment and of course the abusive childhood) AND my reactions to them e.g. blaming myself, self-sabotage, feeling futile, discouraged, bad habits, unhelpful implicit relational and emotional patterns that keep repeating. Whatever it is that led into this black hole. I guess the situation gets more frustrating with every attempt to heal that did not work. I tried many medications (almost all of them), several psychiatric stays, several years of therapy (CBT, depth psychology), the Hoffmann process, all kinds of meditations, body work, “giving up and surrender”, Eckhart tolle etc you name it.. they all helped a little but nothing really worked in the long term.

And it sucks that nothing seem to work permanently.

She has boyfriend so I don't even want to see her. But there was huge problem for me every time i thought about love or something similar i wanted to puke, no joke I almost puked way too many times, but after few days life became normal like usual.

Now i'm 20, after my hb I just stopped caring, I was really good student didn't even skipped school. But now I haven't been to school for 1,5 weeks. And the puking is coming back for no reason, but not as strong as it was. I feel like I lost motivation, fun and how to smile, getting worse vision, it's hard to concentrate on one thing. I'am getting easily exhausted, walking  2x slower than I usually did. I'm oversleeping no matter if i go to bed early, I still oversleep school. Also I'm listening to the one song like crazy obsessed, because it puts me at ease for some reason, even when i met up with my friends I still listen to the same song. Even when I'm going to sleep I listen to the same music. Don't know if it helps me or does it makes it worse. I started smoking 1 pack of cigs in a day,  usually 1 pack of cigs lasted about 4-5days.

I feel emotionally unstable, like my eyes get teary for no reason.  


I think I have fever lately, and don't understand if it's hot outside or cold. 

Lately i been thinking it would be nice to not feel anything, like lock all the feelings, emotions. And have peace. If u know how to lock emotions tell me ;3

I have suicidal thoughts, bcz i'm ur typical normie but i'm hanging there by small thread, I don't have courage to do something to my body.

I don't even know why tf i'm writing here. Oh, I think I know why am I writing here. Wanna be my friend? that could backstab so it would help cut that tiny thread, or ignore this post like usually i'm ignored which would put more weight and that thread wouldn't be able to support the weight.

I had ""depression"" 1-2 years ago, talked to my bestfriend made it better and it was gone not long after that. but that was like lvl 1, now i feel like it's lvl 5. Oh u say talk to my bf agian, but last night when I went to him I was afraid to show my back, when he let me go first inside.

I don't wanna see any doctors, because if i actually had depression then it would only make it worse. (like totally im not afraid of seeing docs... I wouldn't even know where to go)

,depression,"Basically I’ve always been a little listless and sad, even in elementary school. I got ok grades, didn’t really excel at sports. I started getting really great grades in college and joined a magazine, volunteered for the local Democrats, had a barista job etc. But still, even when I was seen as “ok” I was miserable. But, I have a lot of friends, I am kind and funny and have a nice time speaking to people. 

Now I’m three years out of post grad and I’m really suffering. I have been a poor performer at every job I’ve done post grad from the internship, agency, to the tech job I have right now. I have been put on a 30 day performance review and probably getting fired.

I don’t know what I want to do. I don’t know why I make these mistakes and fuck up my entire life. I feel like I’m broken, how will I ever make money?? I’m really on my own. I have rent and bills to pay. I could get another job, but I can’t deal with sucking and getting fired at the next one. 

I am on Prozac now so I am hoping this will help. I feel like being up for being fired was a wake up call. I am so ashamed I let this happen.

I got ok grades, didn’t really excel at sports. I started getting really great grades in college and joined a magazine, volunteered for the local Democrats, had a barista job etc. But still, even when I was seen as “ok” I was miserable. But, I have a lot of friends, I am kind and funny and have a nice time speaking to people. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now I’m three years out of post grad and I’m really suffering. I have been a poor performer at every job I’ve done post grad from the internship, agency, to the tech job I have right now. I have been put on a 30 day performance review and probably getting fired.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don’t know what I want to do. I don’t know why I make these mistakes and fuck up my entire life. I feel like I’m broken, how will I ever make money?? I’m really on my own. I have rent and bills to pay. I could get another job, but I can’t deal with sucking and getting fired at the next one. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am on Prozac now so I am hoping this will help. I feel like being up for being fired was a wake up call. I am so ashamed I let this happen.&lt;/p&gt;

I used to text those crisis hotlines, but they never help anymore. They’re all trained to recite the same things, and it’s aggravating having the same conversation over and over again where it doesn’t really feel like my feelings are really being validated. 

Everyone goes through things. I know that as much as the next person. The world is a cruel yet charming place filled with a mixture of amazing people and people who couldn’t give two shits about others. I hate how complicated the world is, and I hate how the good things people do never seems to lessen the bad things. I have turned into such a cynical person and as time goes on I’ve found it harder and harder to see good in the world past some amazing friends and the unconditional love that animals provide. After someone killed my beloved dog though, everything just feels bleak again. He didn’t deserve the death he got, and it angers me that nobody even wants to put in the time to find out who would have done this to my best friend. “It won’t bring him back”, you’re right. It won’t, but maybe it would settle this raging anger I have inside? Maybe it would help me feel less guilty about the fact I wasn’t there for him because I was too busy fucking around in college? He gave me everything, and I gave him loneliness while someone brutally murdered him.

The more I think about it, the more I consider the fact that I’m probably meant for misery and this is why the world constantly kicks me back down when I start to get back on my feet.

I have started to draw away from my support system too, not because they’ve done anything wrong but because I am tired of bothering them and they all have their own things going on in life without me coming around to be the depressed sack of shit that I am. 

I wish I hadn’t failed my suicide attempts in the past. I wish I was selfish, naive, and brave enough to try again. I wish I didn’t feel these things inside.

,depression,"Hello everyone. I'm sorry for taking your time, but I need help. 

A bit of a back story to my life: I come from a not-so-well-off family, mom left me (9at the time) and my sister (14 at the time)in my father's care (she left the country), to earn more so we could at least have a bread on the table. My sister took her frustrations on me, was being bullied at school gor not having a functional family, my father distanced himself from us... life generally sucked. I was also getting (at the time undiagnosed) migraines, which my sis and dad kept insisting that I'm lying about for attention, was even punished for it. So I stoped talking. After a long 2 years, my mother had applied for divorce, mainly due to my father's threats and mental abuse. By what I saw, my father was threatening my mother to throw me and my sis in the streets if she didn't send more money. The divorce was messy and a lot of shit throwing at eachother. It ended with my sis insisting that we need to stick toghether and since she was older, she insisted that we stay in my home country with my dad, also to spite my mother, who she now hated. The next years were rough, a lot of screaming, bullying, hitting, starving... list is long. (Just on a side note, I ended up climbing trees from windows to grab aome nasty fruit for my class mates and trading them and homework for sandwiches. Did I care I was millimeters away from dying, NAH!) Highschool was worse with the bulying, mom was still away but now, she had someone (she met the guy before the divorce, but I can't blame her. She was alone in a country where my people were, and still are, very hated). We tried to get mom to get cuatody of me, but for reasons I still can't wrap my head around, it failed. Well, her (now) husband lost his crap, and kept repeating to me and making me feel like pure shit because the process failed. It did fail because of me, yes, but as I said previously, I still don't remember why I said what I said and what happened. Years later, they decide to go to a better place, Australia! After 4 years of struggles and 3 lost cases, I finally get to get my (20 y/o) ass there with my mother. I get a boyfriend, her husband turns out to be the dickhead of the year and, long story short, I get kicked out of the house after only 1 year living with them, and end up with extremely severe anxiety because of him.

This year I turned 24. I still live with my boyfriend, who took me in. But here is where the problem is. I want to end it. So much stuff is going on, and all I can say is that it's too much. I was diagnosed (discovered by accident) with clinical depression at the age of 16, and was never addressed. I always felt like something was wrong, but every time I tried to look for help, was told to suck it up by the counselors and psycologists (admittedly, I only worked the courage to go 3 times in my life).

But in the past 3 years, I felt lost. I've been depressed and can't seem to get over it. I find no joy in life or any of the things I used to love. I have no reason, energy or motivation to move on. I drive to work, I work, put a fake smile, drive back, sleep, agrue, sleep, repeat. I feel so angry all the time, I ended hating myself more than ever, and I don't know why! I feel my partner is not there, he's stuck in his games and not engaging, and I think this is because I put too much pressure on him. I can't see my mother to talk to her, my sister doesn't talk to me and I had to go full no contact with my father. And whenever anyone asks me how I am, all I can do is repeat ""I'm fine"" and smile. I hate it... I hate it all....

Sorry for putting this all out, but I had enough of this. I want to smile, to enjoy things, but I can't... I need help. I knew I had to write this after I watched some reddit reading and was crying like an idiot at how accurate and true the things said in said reading were (the topic was ""What do you wish more people knew about depression"")

Dear mods, if this is not the right place, kindly let me know. If would be great if you could direct me to the right subreddit.

English is not my first language so please bear with me.

**TL:DR**
I have done a lot of reading when I procrastinate from work. I want to start a daily journal on reddit to keep track of my positives and negatives, my progress, and hopefully get advices on when I go wrong. 
I noticed that I get overtly stressed over tiny chores/work/things to do, and I'd like to tackle it via progressive increase in exposure and desensitization. Then incorporate other CBT techniques.

***Story/Background:***

I have only recently been diagnosed with Major Depressive Disorder after a close friend forced me to. Looking back now, I think I first had mild depression around 16yo.
I recall having a general apathy towards life, results, ambition, family, and friends. Any motivation is fleeting and I'd spend most of my days daydreaming. Perhaps hoping for some catastrophe in the school so that I'm no longer bored.
The depression seemingly subsided - at least I think so - as I continued on aimlessly on some path my family/culture/friends expected of me. while I'm not excelling, I'm not underperforming. I have close group of friends and we enjoy movies and outings.
It all went to hell when I was around 22/23yo. I should add that I have Contamination OCD and during my University days, decided against my better judgement that I should live with a close friend.
This proved horrible as my OCD meant I couldn't live normally or telerate their habits. I thought I had it in control and hid my oddities well. I didn't. 

My housemates at the time hated me and talked loads behind my back. All the while I was oblivious about their hatred towards me while they acted normal around me. I noticed somewhere around 3 months in. I had the chance to look through their messages and curiousity started my depression.
Reading through all those hate filled complaints and messages was painful. Having to sleep in the same room as him after was impossivle. To act civil while I moved out was tough. While we did not have a big fight because we both hated confrontation,
our 6year friendship fell apart; along with it, I resolutely cut ties with the entire group of friends that was associated with this guy. 

I believe this to be the ""event"" which kickstarted my depression. Worse still, I moved to a different place and had another falling out with another group of housemates. We started off great, even went on a trip together. In about two months, I don't recall the cause of it. But I remember they confronted me on something and I just started withdrawing from them. 
After that, I stopped going to lectures and classes. I was fired from my club because I couldn't perform anymore. (I spent the first year making it into the committee), As a result, I graduated with a subpar GPA. I've never felt worse. I feel like I disaappointed my dad, wasted his money, and failed to prove myself to those who looked down on me.
I spent the next two years isolating myself in my room, only going out for groceries if I absolutely have to. I avoided the housemates by being active at odd hours. I lied to my family that I was trying and failing to apply for jobs while the truth is I mindlessly watched seasons after seasons of brainless TV. 
I am eternally thankful that my dad supported me through this lie. He paid for my rent, food, and courses I took because I wanted to extend my visa. Oh, I was also an international student so you can imagine how much money that costed. 
I cannot begin to describe the amount of guilt I feel. 

The reason I'm even trying to get better is because of guilt. My main motivation is to make them proud of me.

When I was 27, I spent a year dodging their concerned calls. They were so worried they sent a friend over to check on me. And finally, they took a flight over themselves. My visa finally expired and I went home.
After getting home, I once again lied to them about job searching and spent a year doing my best to avoid family events and outings. Finally, last year they forcefully got me a job with my relatives and I've feel into a routine since then.
I majored in Finance and Accounting in Uni. But my results were subpar and it has been 3-4years at this point. I barely remember a thing and I can't perform. I can't even get myself to pick the knowledge back up. 
Admittedly though, the work I perform doesn't require that much. But alas, I fail to perform. I find it difficult to get myself to issue a simple invoice which takes 5muinutes tops. 

I am more and more disappointed in myself over time. I hate the job, but I haven't even sent out a single resume. The very thought of going for interviews and exposing myself as incompetent frightens me. GEtting judged by anonymous HR people makes me hate myself.
I contemplated all kinds of alternatives ie: getting a remote part time job so that I can make extra income while improving myself. Taking courses online and hopefully put me ahead of others.
Ultimately though, I have not brought myself to do any of those things. Even this reddit post took 5days of contemplating before I could do it.

I know what I should do, and people will say ""you never know if you never try"" but I can't help but imagine the negatives. Posting for help on reddit for example opens me up to judgement from random strangers, trolls, even scams, some of them incredibly damaging. 
Improving myself via courses/books/lectures can be an enormous time sink. Not to mention that what is learned may not even be useful to me in the future and may end up being a waste of time.
Currently, I spend the measly 4 hours of free time I get after getting back from work watching movies or reading novels. They're not entertaining nor boring, but they keep me sane. I dread the day that they are taken away. 


***Analysis:***

Growing up, I've been instilled with the idea that I am smart, but lazy. I believe this became a part of my core identify. I'm 29 and I don't recall ever working hard, for anything. 
I've coasted through life however, largely because my parents made me go to numerous additional tuitions, cram classes, etc. I've never done homework, mostly copied them off of friends, but have the concept repeated to you enough times and it gets carved into memory.
My results up till 15yo were always above average. 

I believe due to the circumstances, I grew up without developing any self-discipline skills. Never having an aim or goal and simply going through the motions meant I was lost the moment those guidance were taken away. Believing myself to be smart also creates a subconcious anxiety - what if I worked hard but still failed? that would mean I'm not smart.

Throughout life, I have had a panic attack twice. Once when I was 10. An art project which took me 20minutes tops was criticised and I broke down in tears and hyperventilated, having to be taken home from school.
The next was when I was 16. Around this time, I was getting progessively more apathetic at school. I struggled to get up in the morning and was often late to school. I was late for 10 times and my parents were called to school which resulted in me hyperventilating once again.
I also spent a lot of time gaming which I believe was some sort of coping mechanism similar to mindlessly watching youtube or browsing reddit. 

Not entirely sure what these events mean. But I think I can conclude that I have an inability to accept criticism or face consequences of my own actions. 

***What I want to do:***

As stated above, I want to tackle my self-disclipline, responsibility avoidance, and anxiety towards work, via progressively increasing exposure. 
I will practice mindful relaxation and attempt to associate the relaxation with the trigger(work).
I will also journal on reddit. 1. To have accountability, 2. to further dissect my thoughts, analyze the issues, solve them. and 3. to get advice.

&lt;p&gt;English is not my first language so please bear with me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;TL:DR&lt;/strong&gt;
I have done a lot of reading when I procrastinate from work. I want to start a daily journal on reddit to keep track of my positives and negatives, my progress, and hopefully get advices on when I go wrong. 
I noticed that I get overtly stressed over tiny chores/work/things to do, and I&amp;#39;d like to tackle it via progressive increase in exposure and desensitization. Then incorporate other CBT techniques.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Story/Background:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have only recently been diagnosed with Major Depressive Disorder after a close friend forced me to. Looking back now, I think I first had mild depression around 16yo.
I recall having a general apathy towards life, results, ambition, family, and friends. Any motivation is fleeting and I&amp;#39;d spend most of my days daydreaming. Perhaps hoping for some catastrophe in the school so that I&amp;#39;m no longer bored.
The depression seemingly subsided - at least I think so - as I continued on aimlessly on some path my family/culture/friends expected of me. while I&amp;#39;m not excelling, I&amp;#39;m not underperforming. I have close group of friends and we enjoy movies and outings.
It all went to hell when I was around 22/23yo. I should add that I have Contamination OCD and during my University days, decided against my better judgement that I should live with a close friend.
This proved horrible as my OCD meant I couldn&amp;#39;t live normally or telerate their habits. I thought I had it in control and hid my oddities well. I didn&amp;#39;t. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My housemates at the time hated me and talked loads behind my back. All the while I was oblivious about their hatred towards me while they acted normal around me. I noticed somewhere around 3 months in. I had the chance to look through their messages and curiousity started my depression.
Reading through all those hate filled complaints and messages was painful. Having to sleep in the same room as him after was impossivle. To act civil while I moved out was tough. While we did not have a big fight because we both hated confrontation,
our 6year friendship fell apart; along with it, I resolutely cut ties with the entire group of friends that was associated with this guy. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I believe this to be the &amp;quot;event&amp;quot; which kickstarted my depression. Worse still, I moved to a different place and had another falling out with another group of housemates. We started off great, even went on a trip together. In about two months, I don&amp;#39;t recall the cause of it. But I remember they confronted me on something and I just started withdrawing from them. 
After that, I stopped going to lectures and classes. I was fired from my club because I couldn&amp;#39;t perform anymore. (I spent the first year making it into the committee), As a result, I graduated with a subpar GPA. I&amp;#39;ve never felt worse. I feel like I disaappointed my dad, wasted his money, and failed to prove myself to those who looked down on me.
I spent the next two years isolating myself in my room, only going out for groceries if I absolutely have to. I avoided the housemates by being active at odd hours. I lied to my family that I was trying and failing to apply for jobs while the truth is I mindlessly watched seasons after seasons of brainless TV. 
I am eternally thankful that my dad supported me through this lie. He paid for my rent, food, and courses I took because I wanted to extend my visa. Oh, I was also an international student so you can imagine how much money that costed. 
I cannot begin to describe the amount of guilt I feel. &lt;/p&gt;

,depression,"I would like to share my situation here presumming this has already been talked about a thousand times. First of all, forgive my English as it is not my first language (Im from Spain).

Im a 26 yo civil engineering, graduated in 2018 after 5 long years of hard study. Before this, I did a couple internships in civil engineering during college. The second one went pretty good and my boss actually wanted to hire me but I decided to leave to start the masters. After finishing it one year later and not finding any job, I ended up in an energy company, in the sales department, a field totally different than my educational background, where I stayed temporarily until I could find something in my field. The thing is, several months have passed and Im still here but also I found out I dont like this job, to the point that it has driven to a state of depression and unhappiness, but still here because of the money. The situation has been aggravated since I cant find anything else, resulting in a feel of no motivation to find other jobs and challenge myself to reach higher in life. Also, I feel that Im not as competent as I should be and that makes me feel bad too. Times is passing and Im still stuck in this conundrum with the pressure of no succeeding. I know this relies in the survival of the fittest and work hard concept but it seems to be more difficult for me.

First of all, forgive my English as it is not my first language (Im from Spain).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Im a 26 yo civil engineering, graduated in 2018 after 5 long years of hard study. Before this, I did a couple internships in civil engineering during college. The second one went pretty good and my boss actually wanted to hire me but I decided to leave to start the masters. After finishing it one year later and not finding any job, I ended up in an energy company, in the sales department, a field totally different than my educational background, where I stayed temporarily until I could find something in my field. The thing is, several months have passed and Im still here but also I found out I dont like this job, to the point that it has driven to a state of depression and unhappiness, but still here because of the money. The situation has been aggravated since I cant find anything else, resulting in a feel of no motivation to find other jobs and challenge myself to reach higher in life. Also, I feel that Im not as competent as I should be and that makes me feel bad too. Times is passing and Im still stuck in this conundrum with the pressure of no succeeding. I know this relies in the survival of the fittest and work hard concept but it seems to be more difficult for me. The only times I feel an extra shoot of happiness is when I practice sports or Im with my girlfriend/friends. But then this bleak mental state hits back again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wonder if any of you have experienced a similar situation and how have you dealt with it.&lt;/p&gt;

,depression,"Exactly a year ago, I turned up at my gf's (now ex) house. She wanted to be angry with me that day, she was walking towards me about to explode.... But I picked her up and ran away with her. She forgot even why she wanted to be angry with me for, we went IKEA to look at new stuff for her apartment and then we went to a cafe in which I took a selfie of us. We were so happy and cute together. That selfie popped up on my one year memories.

Fast forward to now, we've been separated since end of October last year. She doesn't talk with me, she removed me from everything except Facebook. 

I am hurting every fucking day. I remember her, I remember all the good times we had, I remember the future plans we had with each other. I don't know exactly when she turned from loving me to leaving me. But I just wish she spoke to me about any concerns she was having. I made my mistakes too by not understanding exactly what she wanted.

She forgot even why she wanted to be angry with me for, we went IKEA to look at new stuff for her apartment and then we went to a cafe in which I took a selfie of us. We were so happy and cute together. That selfie popped up on my one year memories.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fast forward to now, we&amp;#39;ve been separated since end of October last year. She doesn&amp;#39;t talk with me, she removed me from everything except Facebook. &lt;/p&gt;

First post on this sub in a while but I'm at a loss of what to do

I'm so fed up of feeling numb and tired and like I don't want to exist and my brain is so fogged that I cant think straight

I'm trying everything - taking the pills, doing the therapy, seeking advice and just nothing seems to be helping

I don't like my job, but I also don't want to resign without anything else lined up and all of the experts and forums and advice systems just suggest trying to 'think in a more positive manner' and I'm really trying but it just feels hopeless, I get 5 minutes of 'maybe this will be OK!' then immediately back to the grey reality

I've started applying for new jobs as my current manager has suggested that we get through year end then if I'm still feeling the same way then perhaps I should look elsewhere

so I kind of don't see the point in actually trying until year end as if I'm not staying then who am I impressing?

,depression,"I (20 m) may or may not have depression and if I do it’s very mild, however that being said I feel this pain because I messed up the future I had with the girl I seriously would’ve hand crafted. I was madly in love with her but long distance made it not work in the end, I don’t have a problem moving on, but what’s hurts more than the break up did is finding out within a couple of months she’s met another guy, flew to him, and is planning on moving in with him. This could’ve so easily been me and her it’s painful. When we were together in person I can easily say that was the happiest 2 weeks of my life. Now I get it most people will think “just find someone else” but like some others I assume I am extremely picky.

Originally, I moved away for a few years. I was unhappy before I left my home, and I found real happiness out west in Colorado for a time. I began traveling around, working seasonal jobs at ski resorts and in national parks, and I really enjoyed it for awhile. I just wanted to keep traveling, but then the realities of life set in.

I didn't have a degree, I wasn't in any sort of high-paying jobs, and I was struggling to make it paycheck to paycheck. Despite all of this, I was still relatively happy. Eventually though, I realized that I missed my family and my old friends terribly, and decided to move back so that I could be around them and get an education.

Fast forward to now. I'm 26 years old, living at my dad's house, working in an unfulfilling job that pays terribly, while I wait for my first semester of school to start. I feel like an absolute failure because I won't even have a degree until I'm 30. I won't start my career until almost a decade after everyone else did. I miss what I was doing and the places I traveled through so terribly much. I feel like I'm missing a part of myself by being back here and I left it out west.

I have considered moving back, but I have no idea how I would afford it, and I don't see any career opportunities for me outside of dead-end, low paying jobs out there. Also, if I don't do school now, then I don't think I ever will. If I moved back out, I would just go back to seeing my family once a year for two or three days, and I love them so much. That was the hardest part of being out there, and I want to be able to see them regularly. I'm extremely close to my parents, and I don't want to miss a moment with them, because I realize that they will be gone some day. Every moment with them is precious.

But, I feel like I'm slowly dying here. I am turned into a depressed, cynical person who cannot see the good in life anymore.

&lt;p&gt;This is what made finally take this step because I could not go on the way I was just existing. So we will see if this is a good step in the direction of finally getting better.&lt;/p&gt;

,depression,"I've been feeling depressed af the last few months, it sort of feels like a relapse after about 6 months of a reasonably healthy mental state.

Basically I feel physically drained of energy all day, I have zero motivation to study or try in any way whatsoever in college. I'm doing a notoriously tough course and barely passed my Christmas exams. I come home exhausted but when I go to bed I just become really agitated and irritated. My heart starts pounding and I struggle to breathe, I can't get comfortable and even if go to bed exhausted at 8/9pm I wouldn't get to sleep until 2/3am.  However in the mornings I struggle so much to get out of bed, I feel like there's almost zero point getting up anyway as I wouldn't even miss out on anything. I end up missing so many of my lectures simply becuase I cannot bring myself to get out of bed. I still live at home going to college but if I lived by myself without parents I could see myself just staying in bed/my room for days at a time. 

Every day passes by in a sort of blur for me, I feel like I almost have a depersonalization disorder as I just operate in autopilot. I feel like a shell, it's almost like I'm just empty inside; I don't feel emotions, everything just feels monotonous and numb.  Honestly I really just don't give a fuck about anything anymore. I used to have passions like playing music/sport/reading/films etc but nothing excites me anymore. I feel like I don't really have an emotional outlet, it's like I'm just existing day-to-day without actually living. Since I find close to zero pleasure in general life I self-medicate with weed; I guess it's just a coping mechanism in order to feel something other than numb. I also think I have memory loss, as the last couple months have really blurred, I honestly don't know where the time has gone or what I've been doing in that time. 

I also have really really bad eating habits, I don't generally eat breakfast and then could go the day without eating. However when I come home I often would binge until I struggle to breathe. 

I also feel socially exhausted every day I have to go into college; pretending to be someone I'm not is mentally draining as I feel like I'm putting on a fake persona just to mask the numbness when all I wanna do is just go to bed/get high. This is probably part of the reason I avoid going to lectures. 

This all eventually caused me to go to the student couseling services in my college sometime last week, however I feel like I wasnt as honest as I should have been regarding my situation, I was definitely making it out to be less severe than it actually is. They set me up with counselling sessions that start in 3 weeks. 

However I feel like my ability to function has been severely impaired in the last few days. Tonight I felt the urge to self-harm for the first time and honestly if I had clean razors I would already have done so. I don't think I can wait 3 weeks for my counselling appointment, I feel like I should go to a GP/psychiatrist and see what they think. I feel like I just want someone to tell me exactly what I have, I'm 99% sure it's depression, and perhaps symptomatic  insomnia/a binge eating disorder. I guess part of me still denies it's depression despite me knowing that it almost certainly is and I feel like I need a medical professional to tell me how it is in order for me to be able to work on getting better. I guess I also want to see if they think that medication could help too. Ultimately I just want treatment as soon as possible, something concrete I can show to myself to tell me that I'm taking steps to improve myself as atm I feel so lost in life, and I feel like a breakingpoint might come soon unless I change things. 

I really don't know where to go from here, I guess this post is just a reflection.

,depression,"Disappointed
That's the one word I would use to sum up the way I feel. Disappointed in everything. 

Myself, for being...mediocre. That's the only word that comes to mind when I consider my life. I've been given so many gifts and people that love me, and I waste it all. I don't quite understand what's wrong with me, but I know there's something not clicking right in my brain. People talk about a certain fire behind someone's eyes, a drive that pushes them to work hard for their goals. I dont have that. I'm not passionate about anything. I find myself with no motivation to do anything, even doing days without eating. Some days I'll be how I used to, full of energy and making people laugh, but, as quickly as it appeared, it's gone. I'm back to laying in bed all day, not speaking to anyone, not doing anything that I'm not required to. The only thing that impresses me anymore is how easily I lie to my own family. As soon as they call, I become this other person. The person they want me to be, who does well in school and never had any issues. 

I don't feel joy anymore. Not a trace of genuine happiness, other than the aforementioned 'good days'. Even the things that used to make me happiest, like Christmas, now just seem annoying and pointless. I can't sleep, often laying awake for hours on end. 

Fuck, I miss him. I miss my Da. I would give anything in the world for 5 more minutes with him. He was everything to me, my whole world. I loved him with everything in me. You could come to him in the worst possible situation, and he would tell you what you needed to hear, and you would always come away feeling better. But now he's gone. He left, leaving a mess that my family has yet to fix, and now I'll never see him again. Never hug him, or hear his roaring laughter. I'll never again have him look me in the eyes and say ""I'm proud of you, son."" And that breaks my heart. Sometimes I go back and listen to old voicemails, just to hear his voice. 

I'm disappointed in my family, some more than others. We all came together as a family for the funeral, and not even 24 hours later they're already fighting. I don't understand what I have to do to let them know I need help. I shouldn't be too hard on them, but if my friend who hasn't seen me in 3 years can discern I'm struggling over the phone, surely my own family could tell. I told them I wasn't ready to go back, that I couldn't handle it, but they didn't listen. I've never once in my life had real freedom. Freedom to choose what I want. Thats not exactly true. Theres 2 options: do what they want, or be on my own. 

Disappointed in those around me. Now, I could never blame anyone here for my problems, but damn if they can't tell. There are people here who's job it is to identify people who are struggling. They haven't approached me, nor have any of my 'friends' here. I went to the counselor once, and after an hour of talking, he told me that he thought my Das death might have had an impact on me. No shit. Say what you will about my high school, but I'm more comfortable telling anyone there that I'm struggling than I ever would be here.

,depression,"I don't even know how to start, I always thought about one thing that always tortures my brain: Everyone are the same, but I am not. When I was a child, being child was the perfect excuse to hide my condition: I don't know how to talk to people, I don't know how to prolong a conversation, I don't know anything about being sociable. In the other hand, I was (and I am) really smart, but I don't really qualify myself about something special, because people are so stupid to think about being self-centered, instead of thinking about the personality itself, that's maybe one of the thing I don't even comprehend about society, well I continue, being able to do whatever you want its something amazing, I felt (I feel) I got the most powerful superpower, being able to think about something interesting to do and make it real, make it like I was professional on something, but if you can't even talk, even express yourself, your brain, all of your amazing ideas are taking down to trash, to something miserable, how much kids, teens worried about the things other people say (I worry too), but I'm 100% sure they can shine if they are with the correct people, ask me, I'm 22 now, in 22 years, Why didn't I find anyone like me?, anyone who I can talk about interesting things and not about superficial and stupid things, anyone who takes the life like a poetry, with right values, anyone who understands me, anyone who I can be myself

I hated my school partners, and they always thought about things on how to ruin my day, I didn't understand why being so small, being so tiny they were so disrespectful to each other, I lived on a city that I can't even pronounce it's name because is the reason of all my misfortunes, people so damn vulgar, so damn low they can't even teach their kids how to be kind, how to be respectful to anyone. I learn about pride, that keep me away from bullying, they don't even know why they bullied me, bullies tend to attack people about their body, about if they are stupid, about a condition, they just attack me because it was me, and I know, they smell it like dogs, possessed maybe, because I didn't find a reasonable reason to understand what they bullied me, but in the middle of that, I thought why just can't we be friends? Why do we attack to each other? Only because I can't be vulgar like you? They is the reason why I hate my ethnicity, this stupid language called spanish talked only by freaking stupid people, because I learned about they, every single piece of word they say, why my country is infested with third-world-people, they are way too worried about lgbt and inclusiveness, why didn't they included me on society?

There was a guy, Alvaro C. was and still is his name, he was the most disgusting, profane, putrid and revolting person I ever met, he was just a compulsive masturbator, obsessed with pornography, I remember when he checked the teacher computer just for looking for sexual content, when he masturbates in class, I couldn't care less about his life except for one thing, he didn't let me breathe one miserable day when I was in school, he just looked for me to having some daily fun, let's make this piece of s**t even more s**t than he actual is he thought, I cried trying to understand why me? what did I got in myself that makes me so despreciable?, he didn't know about what thing inserted in my mind, now I'm him, now it's me who have a problem with porn addiction

In the other hand, I was (and I am) really smart, but I don&amp;#39;t really qualify myself about something special, because people are so stupid to think about being self-centered, instead of thinking about the personality itself, that&amp;#39;s maybe one of the thing I don&amp;#39;t even comprehend about society, well I continue, being able to do whatever you want its something amazing, I felt (I feel) I got the most powerful superpower, being able to think about something interesting to do and make it real, make it like I was professional on something, but if you can&amp;#39;t even talk, even express yourself, your brain, all of your amazing ideas are taking down to trash, to something miserable, how much kids, teens worried about the things other people say (I worry too), but I&amp;#39;m 100% sure they can shine if they are with the correct people, ask me, I&amp;#39;m 22 now, in 22 years, Why didn&amp;#39;t I find anyone like me?, anyone who I can talk about interesting things and not about superficial and stupid things, anyone who takes the life like a poetry, with right values, anyone who understands me, anyone who I can be myself&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I hated my school partners, and they always thought about things on how to ruin my day, I didn&amp;#39;t understand why being so small, being so tiny they were so disrespectful to each other, I lived on a city that I can&amp;#39;t even pronounce it&amp;#39;s name because is the reason of all my misfortunes, people so damn vulgar, so damn low they can&amp;#39;t even teach their kids how to be kind, how to be respectful to anyone. I learn about pride, that keep me away from bullying, they don&amp;#39;t even know why they bullied me, bullies tend to attack people about their body, about if they are stupid, about a condition, they just attack me because it was me, and I know, they smell it like dogs, possessed maybe, because I didn&amp;#39;t find a reasonable reason to understand what they bullied me, but in the middle of that, I thought why just can&amp;#39;t we be friends? Why do we attack to each other? Only because I can&amp;#39;t be vulgar like you? They is the reason why I hate my ethnicity, this stupid language called spanish talked only by freaking stupid people, because I learned about they, every single piece of word they say, why my country is infested with third-world-people, they are way too worried about lgbt and inclusiveness, why didn&amp;#39;t they included me on society?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There was a guy, Alvaro C. was and still is his name, he was the most disgusting, profane, putrid and revolting person I ever met, he was just a compulsive masturbator, obsessed with pornography, I remember when he checked the teacher computer just for looking for sexual content, when he masturbates in class, I couldn&amp;#39;t care less about his life except for one thing, he didn&amp;#39;t let me breathe one miserable day when I was in school, he just looked for me to having some daily fun, let&amp;#39;s make this piece of s&lt;strong&gt;t even more s&lt;/strong&gt;t than he actual is he thought, I cried trying to understand why me? what did I got in myself that makes me so despreciable?, he didn&amp;#39;t know about what thing inserted in my mind, now I&amp;#39;m him, now it&amp;#39;s me who have a problem with porn addiction&lt;/p&gt;

And yet these thoughts they still exist and seem to scare and creep and haunt.

Plenty of ways to go about it, some are easy, some are not.

I'm standing on a bridge, I'm looking down at frigid water.

I have come here with a thought, and intentions of self-slaughter.

Someone to shout and pull me down, stop me from doing something dumb.





I want a stranger's embrace, to reassure me it's okay.

To tell me that it isn't worth it, that the trip's only one-way

I want to bawl and breakdown, in the arms of the unknown.

So I can maybe feel cared about, and not feel so alone...





Now I'm in my room, with a note and rope in hand.

Thinking I'll finally fall through, let my thoughts and mind disband.

But when I step off of that stool, I want my mom to come rush down,

To pull me out my quiet guillotine, and stop my silent drown.





Oh, she'd probably hug and sob, knowing what I had tried to do.

Glad she ran down stairs to check on me, as if had been on cue.

That night would stay with her forever, make her always high alert,

To stop her child from disappearing, or end up permanently hurt.






However in both situations, I would simply end up dead.

I'm not patient when it comes to my feelings. I want this feeling to go away more than anything. I've basically sheltered myself in my room for the past year and a half. I don't remember how to talk to people or act in public. I have a job, but only because I'm striving to not be homeless.

I don&amp;#39;t remember how to talk to people or act in public. I have a job, but only because I&amp;#39;m striving to not be homeless.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m sorry if anything I said upsets anyone somehow, I really needed to say something. I&amp;#39;m starting to lose the battle in my head again. I feel like I&amp;#39;ve been fighting it for much too long. I want to just give up fighting and give in to the sickness taking me over.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not yet though. Trying to stay hopeful even when I don&amp;#39;t know why.&lt;/p&gt;

On the weekends I'll either just sit in my room all day watching YouTube or nap all day because I can't even find the energy to get out of bed and do anything. I can't even find the will to finish my overwhelming amounts of homework. I don't enjoy anything anymore.

I am so desperately alone and I feel like a absolute worthless moron. My entire life I've never even had one friend to talk or confide in. Every time in the past when I was going to public school and tried to make friends with people I always fucked up and made myself look idiotic because I never understood how to talk to people and form connections with them.

What does it mean when you feel so sad/lost/hopeless, but none of your friends or family seem to notice? To be constantly around people, but to feel so alone? To feel like you're being sucked into this black hole, but no one is around to help you out? To not really know how you feel? To wishing you were brave enough to tell other how you're feeling? To reach out for help? But at the same time, feeling hurt because nobody seems to care? To want someone to look into your eyes and see the sadness and tell you it's going to be okay? For the ones 'closest' to you to hear the lie in your laugh? To feel alone? Abandoned? Like you'll never be happy again? To be so scared that you'll feel this sad and lonely forever? Sometimes I really wonder if there is a single person out there that cares about my feelings, about my health, about my state of mind. I try so hard to be shoulder to cry on for my loved ones, to be a support system. But what about me? I've spent my whole life putting other people's needs before my own, and now that I'm trying SO HARD to focus on myself and put my needs first, I'm alone. Even the few people I've shared my feelings with are nowhere to be seen. What's the point in sharing if nobody cares? Because nobody cares, right? I think it's pretty obvious at this point. So what do you do when you have no support system?  No one in your corner to encourage you? To fight for you? To fight FOR you? When there's no one to tell you 'it's going to be okay'? To give you a hug while you cry? Because you're always crying. I don't know.

So my thoughts are just gonna be thrown out there so without further ado....
I think I suck. At everything...my job, having friends, just...everything really. It honestly feels like I cannot just work like a human being.

Now don't get me wrong, i don't hate life. I have things I rather love about life such as my family and my job including the people I work with.

And everyone keeps telling me how ""nice"" and ""good"" I am at my job such as winning a rather ""employee of the month"" sorta thing but as strange as this seems....

I struggle to believe them. Now of course I'm not calling them liars I just find it to hard to believe. I know that sounds rather stupid but I honestly just can't help feel this way.

As I said I truly love my job and everyone there but that is honestly where most of my self esteem comes from so constantly thinking I'm horrible at it is obviously not a good cycle.

Now as for everything else apart from my job, well I will just break it down like this:
I'm at overweight, ugly, shy, embarssing and awkward guy that honestly anyone could cringe at talking to. And of course I'm trying to overcome some of these things like the overweight part but...I'm honestly losing hope at this point and it's giving thoughts of doing something silly to my self.

,depression,"Long story short.. I've been in and out of college, failing out two different times taking breaks from classes once or twice. I've had on and off addiction problems with alcohol during this time.. basically I've been trying to get a bachelor's degree for 7 years. The last 4 years of college has caused me soo much stress. My parents are wealthy and not to say they are at fault in any way for my failire but they have sort of enabled me financially  to keep trying to get a degree. Ive wasted probly around $100,000 dollars on failed/withdrawn classes. My sister deeply resents me for this. I have an insane amount of guilt for this too even though my parents say they would pay anything and help me in any way they can for me to graduate. 

So after all that, i made it to my final semester b4 graduation. Im only taking 2 classes but i might fail 1 of them and that would result in my 3rd and final academic dismissal, meaning i wount get a degree cause of a flunk in my final semester. I just dont understand why i cant just sit here and do my homework and actually care. My problem is i dont give a crap about anything unless i have an innate desire or interest in it. Like my motivation is just 0 in anything thats academic i dont understand why!

So after all this.. even if i do pass and graduate i feel like im so broken, endured so much stress by the age of 26 that i feel like just a vegetable now.  i cant fathom myself using my business degree to get a ""real job""  i dont know if ill ever be able to get over the idea that i spent over 250,000 dollars on a degree and i have no desiree to work a normal job because i feel like my brain is this empty void that only seeks pleasure and has no purpose or drive. On the surface, im a happy bubbly person. Im outgoing and very sociable. I feel deep down i really have alot of potential but im soooo lost and so easily overwhelmed by everything. I feel the slightest bit of resistance and i just shut down mentally and seek pleasure in the form of leisure activity or alcohol.

,depression,"I broke up with my bf about a year and a half ago, after being together 4 years. Throughout our relationship he was often depressed, angry at everything, narcissistic, extremely anxious, would go through phases of not eating, etc. I tried helping as much as I could and encouraging he get help (which he did a few times, on and off seeing a therapist) but it never worked.

I had to cut off our relationship because it just became ""too much"". He would blame me for his carelessness, would get annoyed if I offered help in any way, and was just constantly negative. I just often didn't feel loved, and without ranting his mental health issues were stressful as I tried and tried to help him and it felt useless.

When we broke up I didn't feel the need to block him but did not want to be ""friends"" or really ever have any communication any more. Since we broke up, he has texted me here and there that he's suicidal, hates everyone, screams at himself, has no reason to live, etc. He told me that since I broke up with him he would kill himself, but i took that more so as manipulation. I would text him trying to help, offering advice, and so on, which was mentally draining because any time I'd try and help he'd continue texting things like ""I'm just gonna kill myself"". I have told him so many times he needs professional help and by doing so will improve his mental health. 

He's nearly 30 and has barely held a job because he ""hates all the managers"" wherever he works and continuously drops out of school to sit at home and be handed money by his mom and play PS4 all day. When I encourage finding a different job or so on he gets offended and tells me I'm a ""slave"" because I have a full time job.

I've since entered a new relationship with someone I love very much. When my ex randomly occasionally texts me (he texts me probably once every 10-15 days) saying he wants to kill himself I panic and reply and try to help. I told my current bf about helping my ex and he was understandably upset. I know I need to stop communication with my ex but I worry by telling him we need to stop talking he actually will kill himself. I have told a close friend this and they told me if he doesn't want to accept help or seek any help, and kills himself, at least I tried and there was nothing more I could do. 

The other day at work I checked my phone and had a ton of missed texts from him saying he was going to kill himself  &amp; that he has no reason to live anymore.

Throughout our relationship he was often depressed, angry at everything, narcissistic, extremely anxious, would go through phases of not eating, etc. I tried helping as much as I could and encouraging he get help (which he did a few times, on and off seeing a therapist) but it never worked.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I had to cut off our relationship because it just became &amp;quot;too much&amp;quot;. He would blame me for his carelessness, would get annoyed if I offered help in any way, and was just constantly negative. I just often didn&amp;#39;t feel loved, and without ranting his mental health issues were stressful as I tried and tried to help him and it felt useless.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When we broke up I didn&amp;#39;t feel the need to block him but did not want to be &amp;quot;friends&amp;quot; or really ever have any communication any more. Since we broke up, he has texted me here and there that he&amp;#39;s suicidal, hates everyone, screams at himself, has no reason to live, etc. He told me that since I broke up with him he would kill himself, but i took that more so as manipulation. I would text him trying to help, offering advice, and so on, which was mentally draining because any time I&amp;#39;d try and help he&amp;#39;d continue texting things like &amp;quot;I&amp;#39;m just gonna kill myself&amp;quot;. I have told him so many times he needs professional help and by doing so will improve his mental health. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He&amp;#39;s nearly 30 and has barely held a job because he &amp;quot;hates all the managers&amp;quot; wherever he works and continuously drops out of school to sit at home and be handed money by his mom and play PS4 all day. When I encourage finding a different job or so on he gets offended and tells me I&amp;#39;m a &amp;quot;slave&amp;quot; because I have a full time job.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve since entered a new relationship with someone I love very much. When my ex randomly occasionally texts me (he texts me probably once every 10-15 days) saying he wants to kill himself I panic and reply and try to help. I told my current bf about helping my ex and he was understandably upset. I know I need to stop communication with my ex but I worry by telling him we need to stop talking he actually will kill himself. I have told a close friend this and they told me if he doesn&amp;#39;t want to accept help or seek any help, and kills himself, at least I tried and there was nothing more I could do. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The other day at work I checked my phone and had a ton of missed texts from him saying he was going to kill himself  &amp;amp; that he has no reason to live anymore. All the texts made me panic terribly, I had to leave work because I started crying and ended up calling suicide prevention (they were beyond unhelpful) because I know he needs help. After 4 years of hearing him talk about being depressed, and never accepting help and then breaking up and still hearing it through text and STILL trying to get him to see a professional and get help I am honestly burned out and mentally drained.

She says yeah I’m on it, another week goes by and my mom tells me that she just doesn’t want to pay for something that I’m probably faking for attention. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All this is just making it worse.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is kind of off tangent but I don’t want to live but I don’t want to die. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyone have any coping mechanisms that a young person can get access to by themselves&lt;/p&gt;

,depression,"Pretty sure this will get buried in all the other posts but I guess I need somewhere to vent... either that or i just want to remind myself what a piece of shit i am. 

I've been depressed pretty much my entire life, i never realised it, i thought everyone was sad all the time and had a constant pit in their stomach like they wanted to cry and had random thoughts about killing themselves. 
I've been going through this shit since elementary school. 
I've always been the akward kid that was overly loud and made jokes at my own expense in order to get others to crack a smile. 
I've never been good at keeping friendships let alone making friendships. Ive always considered myself a loner in a way, mainly because I always feel like I want to be alone. 

I've never been to a party unless it was for a birthday, never gone drinking with friends, never really had a conversation with anyone without it turning into an akward silence after a while. 
I'm currently a senior in highschool and I feel like I've wasted my highschool years. 

My freshman year I met this girl, she was great, caring, shy, cute, and seemed to truly listen to what i said. 
I never had the balls to ask her out which I suppose was a good thing because later on I found out that she was gay. 

After half a year, she got more and more involved with the highschool lgbt community which was full of just flat out rude people. 
This changed her... for the worse. She started spending alot less time with me, and before I knew it we had gone an entire month without spending any time together. I'd always ask her if she wanted to hang out but she was always ""busy"". 

She slowly started to do a complete 180 from who she used to be. She was becoming very self centered and was always saying how nice of a person she is. 
I eventually stopped talking to her completely because I realised she was destroying me. I was in love with who she used to be and I guess I thought that the harder I tried to be her friend, maybe shed start to like being around me again, i guess i was wrong. 
At one point i stopped even acknowledging her like she did to me and i guess this annoyed her because she would text me and ask me why i was doing it. 
I'd send a lengthy text explaining why and it's like she didnt even read it because she kept doing the exact same things that i told her were making me feel like trash below her. 

This friendship absolutely destroyed me and i became extremely depressed. I became somewhat of a hermit that would go to school and as soon as I got home would sleep until the next day. 
I still am really sad about what happened and I cant help but blame myself for not doing something or saying something earlier about how her friends were making her treat others. 

Well, basically, this kind of destroyed me self esteem and any confidence I had left. I was now the quiet kid at school, although my friend says that i dont really seem like the quiet type, I'm 6 foot 2 inches tall and am built like a ""viking"" as he says. 
I havent spent time with him in months because I can barely bring myself to leave my house. 
He is pretty much my last friend and i feel like I'm letting him slip away like i have with all my other friends and its destroying me but I'm too afraid to do anything about it. I hate myself, I'm a terrible friend and I dont know how to change it. 

I've always been known as the ""nice guy"" who helps in any way I can and likes to talk to anyone who is willing to give me the time of day. Now.... well I dont even know. 
There was a lady at the store the other day who dropped something, she had a cane and her arms full and I just fucking watched her struggle to pick her stuff up off the ground. What kind of fucking person just watches someone struggle??? Apparently I do... I just like, froze I guess, I couldn't move my body, it was like I was paralyzed and I had a pit in my stomach and I felt just really anxious if that's how youd describe it. 
I hate who I've become, I just want to go back to being the kind guy who always helps others instead of watching them struggle like a jackass. 

I dont know how to fix who I have become and I'm afraid it's going to affect me when I try and get a job this summer and when I go to college, I'm afraid I'm going to be this shell of who i used to be, someone who just watches things happen instead of giving a helping hand. I feel like agoddamn failure, mainly because I am. 

I guess this story type thing doesnt really have any point, just me talking to myself reflecting on how much of an asshole I am. If someone actually reads this, well, then I'd love any suggestions on how i can get rid of this damn shell. 

I left alot of details out, but it's 1am and I have school in the morning so maybe I'll come back sometime on my computer and fill in a bit more.

&lt;p&gt;I left alot of details out, but it&amp;#39;s 1am and I have school in the morning so maybe I&amp;#39;ll come back sometime on my computer and fill in a bit more. 
Thanks for reading this if you did, I sincerely hope you dont have to go through what I&amp;#39;ve gone through.&lt;/p&gt;

I feel myself, yet again, sliding into the abyss of darkness.

Is it better that I remain fueled by anger and frustration at the CCP? When hopelessness overtakes anger, I feel sucked into a swirling vortex of desolation.

Knives, scissors, any shiny sharp object - they all beckon warmly, seducing me with sweet promises of an end to this pain.

Carefully laid plans, budgets, all gone awry because of a situation beyond control. Exacerbated by one man's greed for power and face.

I fear to run out of anger. When fury no longer triggers, and desolation lays waste to sanity, it would probably be the beginning of the end.

,depression,"Hey! The past year I've been really depressed. I tried to kill myself and felt like it wasn't getting better at all.

The destination of my thoughts was always suicide. I thought about it a lot. I planned multiple suicide attempts. I wrote  farewell letters. Stuff like that. 
Now I slowly return to my true self. It's like I'm able to see the world in colour again. It's not that I'm always happy. There are days I feel bad. Even days I'm depressed again.

,depression,"First of all, some details about me. I am 25 years old male in my last semester of college (yaaay!) and I call myself protypal geek - introverted IT guy who loves fantasy and Sci-fi. I am from a small European country. 

I am struggling with a feeling I can't quite name. Most of the time I feel incomplete, like some vital piece of me is missing. This feeling goes away and the world turns brighter the minute I start feeling attracted to someone. Just the possibility of having a girlfriend makes me happy, that feeling of hope. And the minute I lose that hope.. well.. hello darkness my old friend.

I've read the usual advice ""you need to be complete by yourself, find a new hobby or something that makes you happy"". I've tried, really tried. It's possible to silence it, but not remove it. When I focus on work, or on a game, a book, anything I need to put my mind on, it goes away. Unless I have a really bad day, then I need to drill through it if I want to get something done.

It kinda sounds like depression triggered by loneliness, is something like that even possible? It also have pretty firm grasp on my life, on my actions to be precise. I am driven to look for at least that hope. I am currently trying to expand my social circle. I found out that there is a pretty big fantasy/LARP community in our country. Problem is that I am going in with finding a girlfriend as my main goal. Yeah I will probably have lots of fun, but that's secondary. Rationally it sounds pretty bonkers.

One last thing I should probably mention is that I had girlfriends in the past, but with big pauses between them. The shortest pause was half a year but a standard pause is around two years which is also for how long I am alone now.

Why am i feeling low starting from immediate problems to longer lasting /more distant problems:


-struggling to write essay

-4 separate deadlines looming, haven't even started reading for 3 of them

-everyone is better than me

-i do not feel like i deserve to be at the uni i am at because i do not feel clever enough or that i fit in and feel like no one cares about me

-my classmate/friend is 700x better than me at everything... She is genuinely good at everything and she loves to ""unknowingly"" rub it in my face and make dehumanising comments if i ever even allude to struggling with anything by the slightest amount... Like if i ever even start to ask her for help or talk about how i dont understand a lecture before i even get a sentence out she cuts me off with ""what? Noooooooo dont be so sILLY, thats obvious!"" or goes on about how easy she finds it or how ""i dont need to go to revision because i know everything and [talking about exam we did earlier in the term which she hasn't looked at her grades for yet] i would know if i got anything wrong and i know i didnt because i know what i was doing"" blah blah blah ok I get it u know everything and are god sent

-If i even suggest i might not be all that ok upstairs she tells me im fine and that i dont need to worry and literally just shuts me down and then  immediately complains when i dont talk to her when we walk to lectures together

-my friend is fucking the most self absorbed person you know and she doesnt even realise and to make it worse we are from polar opposite social classes (i.e she is rich, privately educated, lived extremely sheltered and ungrateful life where ahe gets whatever she wants whenever) so she always makes comments about things like if i mention student debt she LITERALLY went ""well your parents pay for university so dont worry""... And i had to go ""no they cannot afford to do that"" and then proceed to tell her, yes, i have had a job since i was 14 and no it wasnt because i wanted experience it was so i could afford the luxury of university and then explain what a bursary was and she kept making ignorant remarks like ""wha- why would you need that"" ""it doesn't cost thAT much"" and just... She is quite dehumanising and makes me feel like utter worthless shit. Its annoying because she doesnt realise how lucky she is and how lucky she is to of had to many opportunities handed to her and all the connections she has to good companies and high paying jobs just because of who her parents are... Like... All im saying is i wish she would stop being so blind to the world and actually learn that there are other people that exist that haven't lived the same life as her and i wish she would be respectful to people and not so fucking oblivious to the world!

-i miss home

-i am burnt out and need a break but i do not and will not ever get one because as soon as term is over, i need to revise. Then term starts and i learn. Then term ends and i revise and study and work and revise. No break ever.

-comparing myself to my sister, my sister being better than me, im expected to do really really well at uni ""for your sister"" (according to my mother since my sister is taking a year out of uni)...

Because i dont matter)... And i also cant go to my parents, not that i ever would have before, because all attention is on my sister and i am not allowed to let them down i have to do well for my sister

,depression,"This is kinda a vent; I need to look myself in the mirror for a few minutes and try to restart my downward cycle. If you want to have a conversation, I’m here for it, otherwise nothing to see here haha.

I’ve been so low the past couple weeks I haven’t felt like myself at all. I’ve felt a fair amount of that apathy I read about on this sub often, and it’s scary.

I know the things I need to do in order to overcome this depression - the tools I can reach for. Exercise, nutrition, therapy, group therapy, being open with friends and family, volunteering, strong social connections, medical health, and on and on. The laundry list is long and tough to grapple with all at once. But having a couple of weeks of pure hell makes me realize that I’m really not working on any one of those things strongly. 

What have I done to really move forward in the last year? I feel like I haven’t really reached for any of those huge steps since I started therapy in 2015. I’ve been going for over four years, and it’s been life-changing, but what other healthy steps have I taken? 

Last summer my dental health became overwhelming, something I must take care of. I went back for my first appointment in years. Gradually I took care of my pain and the rot in my mouth was alleviated. I lost a tooth in the process but a huge weight was lifted as well. 

I need some similar weight lifted now, but most of all I want to be able to reach for it. I crave some discipline; the dental work came as a result of time running out as it were, reactive not proactive. I want to be strong enough to work thru this shit at a healthy pace, not leave things go awry for months on end, until a consequence happens. But I suppose in order to get there I have to first admit that I AM weak and I DO need help. I can’t do it all on my own like I tell myself I must. 

I’d really like to get an exercise bike. I can see all the positives: cardio health/body positivity/motivation to hike more/overall getting in shape. For someone healthy, buying a bike (putting in the research, going to stores, asking people for advice) would be doable. Simple tasks like that are fucking hard for me because I’m not healthy.

So how do I get there? Ask my sister to take me shopping one day? This post is a good start: question why I’ve failed in the past and talk through the doable steps, remind myself of the positive outcomes in working thru it. Maybe I need to meditate again: breathe thru the pressure in my chest when I think about going to a bike store or talking to people on Craigslist. 

I wish I could work thru these things easily like a normal person. I guess my win today is admitting I’m broken and depression is at fault. Maybe if I admit that more often I’ll see it’s ok to ask for help and beat myself up less.

I’ve never really lost love for myself because I know I’m a good man. My therapist told me that purpose can be looked at as two halves: BEing and DOing. Right now I’m happy with my self-philosophy and who I am when I’m NOT depressed. That person is good. It’s time to accept that I’m not healthy enough to DO good yet. At least not to the degree that I hope my future holds. It’s hard to reconcile how much depression is holding me back.

I hope I can look myself in the mirror this deeply in the next little while and reach for more of that help that I need to pick myself up off the ground. Maybe it can start with the exercise bike.&lt;/p&gt;

,depression,"I've struggled with major depressive disorder for years now, I was officially diagnosed in 2016 but I know I had it for about 5 years before that at least. I've had a suicide attempt (right before officially being diagnosed) and since have had ups and downs... the downs happen about every other year.

Tonight I'm sitting at work, wanting to run away, cry, and hide. I've been doing fairly good lately but I just received life changing news a few nights ago, and I am not ready for this change.

I told my SO exactly how I feel and what I want (well maybe I should say don't want), which was relieving and helped me feel better for a few minutes but now I'm back to stressed out and wanting to cry. I'm worried he secretly hates that I don't want the change. Will he break up with me even though we are engaged and haven't had any issues? I hope not.. he always tells me he wants me to be honest with him and not keep things from him, so I'm trying to be open/honest but I know he doesn't enjoy hearing my honest opinions and feelings at times.

How can you bring a child into the world though when both parents would be in debt, one is jobless, we aren't even married yet, I struggle with my mental health/anxiety regarding everything about having a kid even all the crap before they are born, and one parent is a registered sex offender still on probation???

I can't do this. I was hopeful for the first couple of days... but then i started considering more about our situation and how we are NOT ready. I haven't tols many people at all, but I told him today if I can't abort it then I want to seriously give it up for adoption. I just can't. 

Call me irresponsible for not being more careful. I try to have the mentality of ""everything happens for a reason"" but I can feel myself falling apart mentally. Work helps distract me to a degree but there is a lot of downtime tonight and I keep ruminating and feeling down. I'm also pretty sure I'm too far along to get an abortion and it isn't like we can afford it anyway. FML :( :( :(

After a month of stressing over getting back into my main group of friends who decided some separation would benefit everyone I learn that I was likely not going to be welcomed back...least not by the few members who genuinely didn't like me.

But it's still a bit disheartening that she doesn't say I love you back...its been 2 insistence and the second time she just said ""You Too"" so maybe she's just distracted by her thoughts and forgot.

,depression,"I just made a journal entry and I thought I could share it to see if it helps anyone going through grief stages. 

There’s something that happens to a person when a piece of your soul passes away. You realize that you’re in denial all this time. That something you never thought you would want becomes something you realized you pushed away into the ignorant side of your mind so you wouldn’t think about it. So yes, a part of my soul is gone. And I’ve been trying to numb that pain that is beyond any kind of description. I feel like I had something precious that was ripped out of my hands and lit on fire to burn. Something that was alive and part of me burned and I could feel that slow, painful burn. Like watching someone you love get tortured by some unknown entity. This results in the stages of grief.... there’s denial. Which I already had since I was a child. I grew up in ignorant bliss. Not wanting to acknowledge what I knew was true. 
The there was anger. This nasty creature that you create to get back at whatever hurt you. And it will literally drive you mad. Crazy, trying to show others how much someone hurt you. Trying to find something called “closure” ( which by the way is the only fairytale or myth that you will ever hear. Closure is the only thing in the world that is impossible). Now you’re stuck in this miserable monster. You wonder how you’ll escape alive and some never do. I’m sorry for the ones who were the center of my anger and unclearity. You did not deserve what I gave you from my period of grief.
Then you bargain. For the sake of whatever sanity you may have left. You bargain for hope, freedom, and whatever else that you have. It’s not a lot. But regardless you bargain just the same. You try to find people who will help and love you unconditionally. Then you realize that they can’t enable the grief anymore than you can. You’re left alone again. Wondering who the hell you have become because it just isn’t you anymore. You’ve become this sad and hopeless mess of a person. The people you love love you so much they can’t take your struggling any more that you can. That’s when your soul dies a little more.
Then there is depression. That’s there through y’all of the stages. That feeling of NO motivation. No life. It’s an empty void but filled with all the feeling mentioned prior. Depression makes you remember your not the only one. You are made of many sad and hurting people who just want some sort of clarity. They just question every day “ why? What can I do? Why am I feeling these things.” This makes you wonder if your feelings are even ok to feel. 
Supposedly, there is acceptance.... I have not gotten there yet. Most with depression haven’t. Good luck to all of us. This is that bridge that we have not crossed and some (myself) are very afraid to cross it. It means that we will be ok. And sometimes that’s really scary because we don’t always know how to feel ok anymore. We have the beautiful loved ones that have been there no matter what. They want our success and happiness. A deep part of our soul wants that too.... the part that is still alive. We forget that part don’t we? My beautiful friends. There is a soul in our bodies. One that has not been ripped away. One that cannot be taken from an ugly thing such as grief. Every day that we are here. Together. Let’s reach out to the part of our soul that has survived.

It was in an office (I mean literally a room with a desk and some office chairs), inside an organization not typically known for mental health services.

,depression,"throwaway:)

As the title says, I am a very insecure person. I have grown up with parents who gave little affection to me and a narcissistic father who has crushed any self worth I have. Throughout middle and high school, I was popular but at the same time, I was never anyone's favorite person. I thought it was because I never had freedom or a phone during those times. I managed to escape and go to school away from my parents in college, but if anything, I have become even worse. I am so desperately afraid of losing the friends that I have made, in particular, someone who is the FIRST person in my life to have feelings for me. He knows me like the back of my hand, but now that we are doing long distance, it's naturally just harder and sometimes I come off as insecure when I ask him things. Most of the time, he is the only one I talk to about many things such as my parents which many don't understand. I just really don't want to lose him and he has said that he is tired of me being insecure, but I am naturally just not that special or pretty or smart and I can't help it. I wasn't like this when I met him, but I can't stop thinking about how he's going to find someone infinitely better when he starts his new job soon and never look at me again.

I am in college so I have little time for hobbies but I still read and work out in my free time. Most of the time I am studying, but I barely get by in school and can't land an internship for the summer.

Recently I've been dealing with a lot of negativity. I'm in jeopardy of losing my family due to some actions I've taken/decisions I've made. My girlfriend and her two little boys have given my life purpose. Before they became my life I would spend more nights at the bar than not, simply because it was something to do. I didn't do this to pick up chicks or anything, it just was better than sitting at home. If I lose them I don't really know what I would do with my life.

There's a quote from Ernest Hemingway that goes ""Every man has two deaths, when he is buried in the ground and the last time someone says his name.""  I am by no means contemplating suicide or being buried. It got me thinking about completely severing ties with everyone I've ever known and starting life over somewhere else though. Essentially burying the life I've had so far.

How long would it take before my friends and family stop trying to find me? How long before I'm not a daily/weekly/monthly thought on their mind? How long before I'm a distant memory or not a memory at all. Could I even do it? I already go weeks without talking to my parents. Longer without talking to my family. Random amounts of time without talking to friends. There's few people I talk to daily and the only person I can say I talk to daily with 100% certainty is my girlfriend.

I&amp;#39;m debating on getting onto some meds and seeing a psychiatrist. Anyways point is can I date if I&amp;#39;m making steps to get better? I&amp;#39;m a 21 ginger virgin male with lots of insecurities and depression doesn&amp;#39;t help. In fact I&amp;#39;m worried I have bi polar disorder because my symptoms fall into that category more so than MDD. My point is I constantly feel like any woman can and should do better than me. I have this crippling feeling every time I like a girl I think &amp;quot;just stop, they can do better leave her alone&amp;quot; literally ALL my friends are in relationships and I want it so bad. I want what they have but I have little to no experience, the one ego boost I have is I was once told I was the best kisser she&amp;#39;s ever met and she been around the block a couple times. I&amp;#39;ll be honest I miss her to, she was someone I would&amp;#39;ve been willing to lose the V to and risk the rejection because she was so nice and one of the most non judgmental people I&amp;#39;ve ever met and she was a nerd to lol. She moved States for school so our fun was cut short.  Should I try to date? It&amp;#39;s really hard for me since I&amp;#39;ve never been in love and don&amp;#39;t know what to look for. I also wanna get the virgin thing outta the way so I&amp;#39;m not one when I&amp;#39;m 40. Fuck society and it&amp;#39;s social stigmas, they&amp;#39;re impossible not to follow it seems. I just don&amp;#39;t see how I can date if I&amp;#39;ll have these feelings for a few more years and I don&amp;#39;t want to be 30 year old man with no experience either. I feel it&amp;#39;s a catch 22.&lt;/p&gt;
