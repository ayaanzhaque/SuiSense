,CasualConversation,"Before you ask, my country isn't as severely impacted from coronavirus as others are, and many activities are still permitted here.

I've been an amateur actor for seven years and I've taken part in many theater plays, although my main goal was always to get a part in a film. Cinema has always been my passion, and theater was, to me, a way to enter its world. So, a couple of days ago, I saw a notification for the auditions for a film randomly, while I was walking in town, and I was excited! We don't have a big film industry in my country, so to encounter such a chance is a very, very rare event. I was preparing for weeks, making up different characters and trying to tap into different emotions, so that I would have a bigger chance of getting the role.

And yesterday, the day of the audition, I was litteraly petrified. To the point where I thought that I couldn't even walk out of the house. But I did it, and it wasn't actually that bad. The director (can't reveal names, although he's pretty well-known internationally) was very good at easing the tension, and letting me know exactly what he wanted me to do, and his associates were also very helpful during the audition.

So today, as I was sitting in my living room, trying to rest (as I hadn't slept the entire night), the phone finally rang. And THANK GOD they immediately told me that I got the part!!! I swear that if they'd started with anything else than ""congratulations"" I'd have fainted.

So... yeay, I guess. I got my first role in a major international production! I apologize if this post made no sense, but I'm too excited to properly type right now (and, as should be obvious, English isn't my first language). Anyway, a big goal I'd set in my life has been fulfilled!

When I entered school, my teacher also always saw me as the guiltily one. Someone punch a boy? I was it. Someone ran screaming through the hallway? I was it. Someone forgot to clean the table? I was it. One of my teacher didn’t even bother to pronounce my name correctly and butchered it for the 2 years I had her. 
So I entered highschool, the older students always made fun of me, how I had slit eyes, even though they’re pretty normal imo, or they would just call me rice eater or make fun of me that my parents were poor, because they were raised during a war. One of my teachers didn’t even bother to learn my name, so one day he just called me „Chinaman“. Another teacher, just got me in a Moment were I wasn’t paying any attention, so he just said: „Open your eyes like every normal person!“.
The past spring I entered College. I have to make some internships, to not get thrown out of my uni. While I received 23 denials, some other students (who applied after me) got the job. Also with the current situation, people are just shouting at me: „Take your virus and piss of back to Asia!“ 
At this point I just smile, and show them my middle finger. Stop being racist. We are *ONE* race. We are humans.

A few years ago, I got my open water scuba diving certification. Part of this certification is demonstrating skills like removing your mask underwater, or taking out your regulator, putting it back in your mouth, and clearing, or taking your regulator out, letting go of it, retrieving it, and putting it back in your mouth. You must demonstrate these skills underwater on an open water dive. You also must go on 4 dives to get certified. While on my second dive, I was performing a skill called mask removal, where you take your mask off of your face, put it back on, and clear it. As I pulled the strap off the back of my head, my elbow caught on my regulator hose and yanked my regulator out of my mouth. There I was, sitting 10 meters underwater, unable to breathe or see. Luckily, I had been trained by good instructors and I knew what to do. I swept my arm around my thigh, hoping to hit the hose so I could find my regulator and put it back in, but to no avail. Upon its failure, I went to my second option- I grabbed my backup regulator off my waist and shoved it into my mouth, purged (cleared the water out) it, and took a minute to take a few deep breaths, then put my mask back on and continued my dive. It only lasted a few seconds, but sitting 30 feet underwater, unable to see or breathe, was the closest I've ever come to ""holy shit, this is how I die.""

,CasualConversation,"So I’m gonna post on here more often, never with any set agenda or topic to speak on. I’m instead just going to ramble and rant about the different things on my mind. 

First off, I met this girl on Tinder and things are going okay. I’m gonna try and lock down a first date before we both head off to university (different universities mind you, so god knows how any of this will work out). 

Secondly, I’ve had a sort of brain-fart moment where I’ve realised that in the capitalistic society that 2020 Earth is, money matters less than ever, and here’s why. 
The working path you take in life is essentially binary, with either sides of the coin being; 
a) working a 9-5, part of the metaphorical “rat race”, having some form of financial security until retirement and enjoying perks from time to time earned by selling your time to your employer
b) becoming self-sufficient, working on your own terms, setting your own schedule, running your own business, becoming successful (however you might measure it). 

For me, Option B has always been the desired path. It’s not that I can’t take instruction from an employer or a superior, or that I find anything wrong with working a standard job. It’s the independence and gratification that comes with working on your own terms that I am seeking. In the past, this was motivated by the idea of making more money on your own, with there being endless potential should you develop a solid investment strategy, or build a successful business. 

But my definition of success has changed. 

The only commodity in the world that people seem to value at the moment is money, which factually is a commodity that can come and can go. And it does. The only commodity we have absolutely zero control of however is time. Time is always passing, never to return. We can never slow time down, or speed it up. We rarely appreciate how long we’ve been around and the experiences we’ve had, because we’re always looking forward  We expect tomorrow to come, because why wouldn’t it? We all expect to live long, happy lives but as time passes, reality begins to kick in. Work takes over our lives, money becomes our central priority. And it’s understandable. 

To enjoy life, and by this I mean see the things you want to see, go to the places you want to go to, and meet the types of people you gravitate to, you generally need money. It’s a fact of life. But the coldest of all facts of life is that our clocks are ticking. We can’t just take the batteries out of the clock and cruise along for a few years, enjoying certain parts of life, just to then allow ourselves to grind at work for the remainder of days. 

Time isn’t appreciated enough. When loved ones or friends die, whether expectedly or unexpectedly, a common phrase thrown around is “I wish I could spend just one more day with you”. But the fact of the matter is that ‘more time’, is the only wish that can never come true. We burn through our seconds, minutes and hours as if we have infinite amounts of them, but we don’t. If anyone is still reading, think of your parents, grandparents, or anyone else you may know. Do you think they are genuinely, infinitely and continuously happy? How many people on the entire planet are? Not many is the answer. 

We devote our lives in a capitalist society to making as much money as possible, without ever really taking extended periods of time to fully enjoy our time while we’re here. Of course vacations, breaks and days off are good. But the words ‘vacation’, ‘break’, ‘days off’. Think about what they mean. They’re words to describe an escape from our reality, where we can try and enjoy time in relaxation, away from the realities of work lives and the seriousness of daily living. We don’t have enough time to ourselves. Parents aren’t spending enough quality time with children. People aren’t seeing enough of the world to fully appreciate their limited time here. 

I’m not saying that a working life is a wasted life. Constructing a career is crucial to offering a somewhat comfortable standard of living. What I’m trying to express is that as a society, we’re losing the concept of appreciation for our most limited resource: time. You can’t buy an extra life, extra hour or even an extra second. Just when life could seem to be going great, tragedy can strike. Of course in that unfortunate moment, perspective kicks in. You have the thoughts yourself, “life is short, enjoy it while you can”. It’s what our grandparents have been saying. Its what their grandparents said before them. 

So why aren’t we making the most of it? If you have a crush on the person from work, ask them out. If you have a grudge against someone, have a respectful conversation and smooth out your differences. If you haven’t told someone how much you appreciate them, then tell them. And most importantly, make sure you do what you truly want to do. Because one day it’ll be too late. It will come, as much as you don’t want it to. 

Because that’s what happens with time. It ticks away, slowly but surely, until one day you wish you could turn back the clock. Make sure you don’t forget what life’s all about, and that’s living.

We rarely appreciate how long we’ve been around and the experiences we’ve had, because we’re always looking forward  We expect tomorrow to come, because why wouldn’t it? We all expect to live long, happy lives but as time passes, reality begins to kick in. Work takes over our lives, money becomes our central priority. And it’s understandable. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To enjoy life, and by this I mean see the things you want to see, go to the places you want to go to, and meet the types of people you gravitate to, you generally need money. It’s a fact of life. But the coldest of all facts of life is that our clocks are ticking. We can’t just take the batteries out of the clock and cruise along for a few years, enjoying certain parts of life, just to then allow ourselves to grind at work for the remainder of days. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Time isn’t appreciated enough. When loved ones or friends die, whether expectedly or unexpectedly, a common phrase thrown around is “I wish I could spend just one more day with you”. But the fact of the matter is that ‘more time’, is the only wish that can never come true. We burn through our seconds, minutes and hours as if we have infinite amounts of them, but we don’t. If anyone is still reading, think of your parents, grandparents, or anyone else you may know. Do you think they are genuinely, infinitely and continuously happy? How many people on the entire planet are? Not many is the answer. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We devote our lives in a capitalist society to making as much money as possible, without ever really taking extended periods of time to fully enjoy our time while we’re here. Of course vacations, breaks and days off are good. But the words ‘vacation’, ‘break’, ‘days off’. Think about what they mean. They’re words to describe an escape from our reality, where we can try and enjoy time in relaxation, away from the realities of work lives and the seriousness of daily living. We don’t have enough time to ourselves. Parents aren’t spending enough quality time with children. People aren’t seeing enough of the world to fully appreciate their limited time here. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m not saying that a working life is a wasted life. Constructing a career is crucial to offering a somewhat comfortable standard of living. What I’m trying to express is that as a society, we’re losing the concept of appreciation for our most limited resource: time. You can’t buy an extra life, extra hour or even an extra second. Just when life could seem to be going great, tragedy can strike. Of course in that unfortunate moment, perspective kicks in. You have the thoughts yourself, “life is short, enjoy it while you can”. It’s what our grandparents have been saying. Its what their grandparents said before them. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So why aren’t we making the most of it? If you have a crush on the person from work, ask them out. If you have a grudge against someone, have a respectful conversation and smooth out your differences. If you haven’t told someone how much you appreciate them, then tell them. And most importantly, make sure you do what you truly want to do. Because one day it’ll be too late. It will come, as much as you don’t want it to. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because that’s what happens with time. It ticks away, slowly but surely, until one day you wish you could turn back the clock. Make sure you don’t forget what life’s all about, and that’s living. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;X&lt;/p&gt;

,CasualConversation,"I'm still a young guy, up to date with pop culture, media, music, games, movies and so, often my family will refer to me for questions about x movie or y artist, I'm simply up to date and I enjoy it

However TikTok fucking blows me out of the water, when I entered I felt like a boomer who doesn't understand what's going on, so many ""challenges"" so many people, they all move fast as fuck, weird ""modern"" remixes of pop songs I know, so many pop and rap songs I've never heard before and people doing synchronized dances to them, incredibly attractive people doing stupid and weird things, it was like Instagram on steroids

""Oh so this person looks at the camera and then moves his face matching the song? Oh ok, neat, WTF 734k likes for this??"" 

""Oh so this guy is doing a duet with this person, but what? Are they seeing each other? Are they videocalling? What's this?""

""Oh I can do a duet too? What will it do? Videocall the author? What if they are asleep?""

""Why does everyone move so... fast?

I don't know what's going on 90% of the time

Everyone is extravagant looking, pink hair, incredibly attractive, or incredibly unattractive and sometimes deformed, some guy with a condition that makes him incredibly mind blowingly skinny dancing shirtless to an EDM song I've never heard, what the hell?

People often change like 15 outfits to make a funny transition and I'm like ""wow you really changed clothes that many times, for a 10 second video?""

Also I often picture a parent walking in on their son/daughter doing a tiktok and catching them mid dance, mid funny face, mid wacky transition or with full makeup/attire and being like WTF

I often ask to myself, ""is this what young people do now?, I don't get it""

And legit I'm not hating it or anything, I know the Reddit mob mentality of ""TikTok bad"", I don't agree with it, I'm more fascinated by it, by how crazy it is, how fast it all moves and I've seen some seriously talented or funny people there and they deserve a platform and audience

It's also extremely validation seeking, and I can see it inducing body dismorphia on some people..

I ""tried"" the camera feature (didn't and will never upload anything) and immediately I noticed my face was smoother, which was fake, there was a smoothing setting for the camera, and checking the other features I found an eyebrow lift, a jawline enhancer or downsize it, a feature that makes your nose more broad or narrow (got some racist vibes here...) skin clearing, eye reshaping, and it looks so real, it's not like a fake filter, I can see people getting attached to this fake image of themselves and hating what they actually look like

It's also incredibly addictive, flashy lights, pop music, challenge after challenge, 10/10 girls doing dances and doing ""POV"" videos ""talking"" to the audience, I found myself spending like 2 hours on it and it felt like 10 minutes 

I feel this social media mixes all the addictive assets of every other social media before into one and enhances it, dopamine hit after dopamine hit, and it goes on forever

Unfortunately, the leasing party said they weren't comfortable with my dog (50lb lab mix) and they rejected me.

I wasn't done, though. I'd waited too long for a place like this. So I called the owners realtor directly and negotiated with him and told him some more info about my dog, and today I got a call that they've chanted their mind!

I just sent in my application and should sign the lease tomorrow!

Point is people: don't take no for an answer. Fight for the stuff you really want because nobody will fight for you as well as yourself (I'm looking at you realtor).

On Wednesday I went looking at places and I finally found the perfect one. I told my realtor to extend my interest asap and to let me know.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, the leasing party said they weren&amp;#39;t comfortable with my dog (50lb lab mix) and they rejected me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I wasn&amp;#39;t done, though. I&amp;#39;d waited too long for a place like this. So I called the owners realtor directly and negotiated with him and told him some more info about my dog, and today I got a call that they&amp;#39;ve chanted their mind!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I just sent in my application and should sign the lease tomorrow!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Point is people: don&amp;#39;t take no for an answer. Fight for the stuff you really want because nobody will fight for you as well as yourself (I&amp;#39;m looking at you realtor).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyway, I still don&amp;#39;t know anyone here so I can&amp;#39;t really go out and celebrate with friends, so I&amp;#39;m sharing it here.&lt;/p&gt;

,CasualConversation,"So I'm 18 and have been depressed for majority of my teens, however I'm proud to say I've finally overcome it, and I don't really know who to tell. 
I used to walk across the street without looking for cars and hoping to get hit by one. I never did get hit but I got a good bunch of horns tooting lol. I never felt like my life had value, like it was something I should protect and guard, I hated myself.

Today, I love myself, I love my boyfriend, I love living. I'm so fucking glad I'm alive. I can't say I'm exactly where I want to be yet, but despite it I've never been happier. I've actually overcome my depression and I almost can't believe it. I've had ""happy"" periods during it before, and while I thought I was cured of it it would always creep back, but I can feel this is different, I've never been so happy for so long before. I went to therapy for 5 years and it never really helped, which in retrospect was probably because I didn't want to be helped. I'm sorry if this comes out weird, I don't really know how to voice my thoughts, I just know I'm so absolutely happy.

Today I woke up from my boyfriend hugging me, whispering in my ear that he loves me and telling me it's okay if I sleep in today - he knows I've had a hard time getting a good night's sleep lately. I went back to sleep while he went out of the room and I assumed that would be it, but just 30 minutes ago he came walking back into my room with a tray and breakfast he had made for me. Breakfast in bed, from the love of my life! I wouldn't believe you if you told me this would happen 2 years ago. I'm marrying this guy, there's no doubt about it.

I don't have the best life yet but I'm happy regardless. I live on my mom's couch, I'm not doing as well in school as I'd like to (though I'm getting better!) and I've gained more weight lately than I'd like to. And still I'm happier looking at myself in the mirror than I was 15kgs ago. I haven't done this all by myself though, my boyfriend has helped me a lot with dealing with both depression and anxiety since we started dating a year ago, but I'm proud to say I've finally done it. I can't even describe the feeling, but if you've ever felt it you'd know. If you're depressed and thinking you can't get out of it, that life won't get better, I thought that too. For years I thought failure and depression was all there is to life. And I don't say this to shit on medication or therapy, those can both work wonders, but I'm incredibly proud to be able to say I've gotten out of it with neither. I feel so strong and alive.

Life can and will be better, I'm so so happy I never did anything drastic during my depression, because then I wouldn't have lived to see my life become so beautiful. And I know it will only get better from here.

It scared me when he first said it but we started talking when then I had to go (It was 3:AM so I had to sleep obviously) he had sent me more messages today and we talked a little more about his feelings and such when he said something I probably will never forget. &amp;quot;I haven&amp;#39;t cut myself since the last time we talked.&amp;quot; I was so relieved to know he hadn&amp;#39;t done it at all between the two times we talked.

I have to admit, I find accounting to be very uninteresting. Often times, I find myself being bored in class, or doing poorly because I can't focus on the content for too long.

Funnily enough, one of my professors posted an icebreaker question where students had to answered why they chose to major in accounting. The responses were very stale, as many students answered with accounting being a stable major and being relatively easier to find opportunities compared to other fields of study.

It's hard to write stories. It's hard to imagine where to take them in your mind and keep them interesting throughout. Endings are hard to write, too. And like I said, people will walk away in an instant if they get bored or don't like a minor thing you wrote. 

The fact is the general population has a 2 second attention span now days, and this is the same audience that's going to read your stories. Most probably don't even know why they stopped reading a story. But in the end, their attention was instantly drawn somewhere else and they stopped reading your story.

And like I said, people will walk away in an instant if they get bored or don&amp;#39;t like a minor thing you wrote. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The fact is the general population has a 2 second attention span now days, and this is the same audience that&amp;#39;s going to read your stories. Most probably don&amp;#39;t even know why they stopped reading a story. But in the end, their attention was instantly drawn somewhere else and they stopped reading your story.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Your thoughts?&lt;/p&gt;

,CasualConversation,"Just a thought, but you know how people say “it’s just like riding a bike” when they describe something that you can easily pick back up? Well I’m 36 and yesterday I wrote a bike for the first time in probably 25 years (quarantine wasn’t kind to my girlish figure lol...jk jk, I’ve always been fat and overweight, just trying to change that) and I think I 100% forgot how to ride a bike. 

But, here’s what I didn’t lose...confidence. When you’re a kid, the biggest obstacle to riding on two wheels is confidence. It doesn’t seem rational to a first time rider, especially a child, that once you’re in motion your bike will stay upright. So “learning to ride a bike” is really “growing in faith, trust, and confidence.”

The physics of bike riding doesn’t change is f you’re 4 or 40 years old. But if you’ve ridden before (even 25 years ago, in my case) you don’t have that giant obstacle as a barrier. So you get on, confidently push off, and begin pedaling. Sure, you’re wobbly AF at first, but that’s because you suck and probably forgot how to ride a bike lol.

,CasualConversation,"So, I had a story to submit in our online class, and it got an 18/20, and because it also recieved great reviews from my friends and batchmates, I decided to share it here.

So when I was, like 5 or 6, I lived in a somehow cramped house, which is normal for Filipinos (I live in the Philippines, btw) soo Magandang Gabi (Good Evening) to everyone! Anyways, it's cramped not because it's a small house, it's quite average, really, but because it has so many things that's just littered everywhere, it looks like it's cramped. Sooo one day, my parents are both working and I'm left with our neighbor, who is about 15 or 16 at that time and, being bored in the house, we decided to play on the streets. So, he took out his bike, while I took out a stack of pogs, and played outside.

While playing, we both noticed a man walking behind us. He's definitely homeless from his looks, and he was asking for spare change, or food. Being penniless, we decided to let him be. For 3 days he did that, and we didn't pay any attention to him. On the 4th day, instead of bringing the usual pogs, or games only, i brought, like 5 pesos worth of cents. I gave it to him once he passed by on us, and he thanked us gratefully.

The next days, I still did what I did, although I felt embarassed for getting cents off of my father's piggy bank, but I thought, maybe one day I'll give enough that he won't come back.

Then one day he stopped showing up. And at first I was happy, but then became curious why he stopped showing up. But noticing it now, I know he achieved his goal somehow.

Fast forward to last year, I was 20, studying Nursing, and then one day, as I got out of school to my part time job, I noticed a familiar fact. It was that man again, but this time, he got a little cleaner, yet seems to be older, more frail, and still a beggar but you can see a change. I can't describe it that much but all I can say is that he's changed.

I approached him and asked if he remembers me, and said no, which is not surprising. Then I asked if he remembers the scenes of my childhood where he is included, he still says no. But he remembered when I asked of a kid who gave cents to him, which made me happy. 

Apparently, the reason why he stopped is because his wife, whom he has separated a year before we first met him, decided to take him back, and, although they only managed to sell charcoals, they had managed to send their son to graduate but, sadly, doesn't even visit them for about 2 years after graduation, according to him.

After our small talk, I decided to give him one of my 100 peso bills, because (not to brag) I'm somehow working for myself and my family, and while money comes to me on a routine, it's better if the money you have, although small, is used for good purposes.

We parted ways after that.

I don't know where the man is now, nor do I know if he is ok or not, but I sure hope he is fine, and happy. I hope he gets to see his kid, because the thought of not going back to family saddens me, and I really hope other people takes care of him.

,CasualConversation,"At the beginning of quarantine, I told myself I would come out of it changed - mentally, physically, spiritually; I would do my best to become healthier in those areas during our time of staying at home. 

The first three months... didn’t go exactly as planned. I fell into old habits, stopped having motivation, you know the drill. 

Yet, since the end of May, beginning of June, I’ve got into the habit of working out for at least an hour every day. I’ve followed YouTube workout videos that I like and the more I did it, the more comfortable I began to get with the physical pain I felt with working out. Through offs and ons, I’ve stuck with it and have been seeing minor results in the mirror! While the lack of “immediate” results was disheartening, today I decided to weigh myself for the first time since April and I come to find that I’m 10lbs lighter. 

It was a really surreal moment. I know people who’ve done weight loss before always say your progress will show with time and that you gotta keep working despite it, but it felt really nice to think that my hard work did that. I’m excited to continue this fitness journey and I just wanted to share and let anyone who may be in the same boat I was a few months ago — know that you can do it.

&lt;p&gt;The first three months... didn’t go exactly as planned. I fell into old habits, stopped having motivation, you know the drill. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yet, since the end of May, beginning of June, I’ve got into the habit of working out for at least an hour every day. I’ve followed YouTube workout videos that I like and the more I did it, the more comfortable I began to get with the physical pain I felt with working out. Through offs and ons, I’ve stuck with it and have been seeing minor results in the mirror! While the lack of “immediate” results was disheartening, today I decided to weigh myself for the first time since April and I come to find that I’m 10lbs lighter. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was a really surreal moment. I know people who’ve done weight loss before always say your progress will show with time and that you gotta keep working despite it, but it felt really nice to think that my hard work did that. I’m excited to continue this fitness journey and I just wanted to share and let anyone who may be in the same boat I was a few months ago — know that you can do it. &lt;/p&gt;

,CasualConversation,"Well, sometimes the small things in life matter. 
That is something my parents always told me. 
And usually I try to life by that. For example letting people in their cars into a lane when they come out of a driveway or so. Or just giving someone a smile or telling them that they look nice. I suppose that makes others happy and honestly, it also makes me happy.  

So today something happened to me I’ll never forget because it was just a small gesture I made which apparently had a major effect on the other person. 
When I go groceries shopping I usually try to get allot of stuff so I just have to go to the supermarket once a week. I try to buy everything I need for a week and that’s it. So after I had my cart loaded with whatever I needed I went to the cash register, lined my things up onto the conveyor belt and saw an elderly woman behind me holding two things. 

I told her that she can get in front of me and check out her two items because I didn’t see the need why she should have waited until I was done. 

What the happened surprised me. She moved in front of me and started to overwhelmingly thank me, she even started crying and told me that there are not many kind people like me around anymore. She was really touched by my small gesture and I was really touched by her reaction.

Turned out she had been let down many times and thanked me in tears.,"[{'a': ':story:', 'e': 'emoji', 'u': 'https://emoji.redditmedia.com/pmjxkvo9ukg21_t5_323oy/story'}, {'e': 'text', 't': ' Life Stories'}]",r/CasualConversation,,False,6,,0,,False,t3_iifgap,False,light,0.93,,public,26,0,{},,False,[],,False,False,,{},:story: Life Stories,False,26,,False,,,False,,[],{},,True,,1598677270.0,richtext,6,,,text,self.CasualConversation,False,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Well, sometimes the small things in life matter. 
That is something my parents always told me. 
And usually I try to life by that. For example letting people in their cars into a lane when they come out of a driveway or so. Or just giving someone a smile or telling them that they look nice. I suppose that makes others happy and honestly, it also makes me happy.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So today something happened to me I’ll never forget because it was just a small gesture I made which apparently had a major effect on the other person. 
When I go groceries shopping I usually try to get allot of stuff so I just have to go to the supermarket once a week. I try to buy everything I need for a week and that’s it. So after I had my cart loaded with whatever I needed I went to the cash register, lined my things up onto the conveyor belt and saw an elderly woman behind me holding two things. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I told her that she can get in front of me and check out her two items because I didn’t see the need why she should have waited until I was done. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What the happened surprised me. She moved in front of me and started to overwhelmingly thank me, she even started crying and told me that there are not many kind people like me around anymore. She was really touched by my small gesture and I was really touched by her reaction. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, I believe we all can be able to do good. Also a small gesture makes a difference. &lt;/p&gt;

,CasualConversation,"Hey all,

I've been wanting to get people's opinion on this, as I'm struggling with a lot of guilt.

I haven't been to the gym since March. Before then I was on a really solid upward trend with my fitness. Once COVID started I did the right thing and parked my ass home. But now that the problem isn't being handled, this thing is going to last for a long time.

I've been considering going back to the gym. If I do back, it'll only be at 6am when it first opens, and if there are other people there I'll just leave. My main fear is that the gym is quite small and in a downstairs area, which is the worst combo.

My condo is incredibly tiny (400ft), and I live with my partner and kiddo. There isn't any space to fit barbells.

I'm (25M) have been through certain hardships in the past and on my way getting myself together now. About 2 years and a half or so ago I was diagnosed with BPD. In retrospect, that was terrible then, both of myself and things around me. Depression and suicidal ideation were often there to be.

I came to see 2 psychiatrists, one with medicine and one with talk therapy, both of whom I have stopped seeing for quite a long time. I made, slow, but, gradual progress in battle with whatever inside me; and recently I have made a small spiritual and mental breakthrough, which really has helped me a lot.

She gets spat on by other cats

Wouldn't it be nice if your work stood on its own?

That design, that bit of writing, that piece of craft--what if what you did was judged solely on the merits, if the people engaging with your work saw it for precisely what it was...

Or consider the doctor, able to heal people merely by providing precisely the right treatment on just the right day.
Or the lawyer, winning the case because she presented the most cogent, rational argument.

Doesn't work that way.

The crowd likes the songs from the singer they came to hear, not the unknown opening act. The patient responds to medicine when he believes in the doctor who prescribes it. The client is far more likely to applaud your work if he's already put down a big, non-refundable deposit.

A huge part of making our work more effective is creating the environment where we will be given the benefit of the doubt. Often, creating this environment is at least as important as the work itself.

When it's just the two of them I could hear the kid on FaceTime go sad and the following exchange happened, 

Kid at my house: hey what's wrong?

FaceTime kid(M): no you won't get it it's family stuff

K: it's ok you can tell me I will understand

FTK: everyone says that but they don't

K: everyone is gone now, so you can tell me about it 

FTK: can I tell you later? 

K: it's ok, I'm here to talk

The conversation kinda ended after that cause the other kids came back but it was just so cute to hear these two boys have an actual caring conversation and just awee it made my heart warm.

,CasualConversation,"COVID has been rough. At the beginning of 2020 I was so excited to move out of my parents house. I had just finished an extra 2 years of schooling post-grad for a second degree and I felt so behind. Everyone else seemed to be living on their own, travelling, doing fun things with friends, and all around establishing themselves as independent adults. I was so jealous. I had been spending all my time with school, living with my parents, and too broke to travel and do all the fun things I wanted to. It felt like my life was on pause. 

At the beginning of 2020 I was so excited to finally be able to press play on life. I had a new degree, a new job, my best friend had moved back to my city and we had a new apartment. I was finally going to get to start my ~independent adult life~

Then, of course, COVID hit. My best friend couldn't get a job and said she had to move home (she would later betray me and sign a lease with other people but I digress... Lol). The same was true for many of my other friends - all moving home. It left me with very few options but to move home as well. 

This summer was hard because once again my life was on pause (thanks, COVID) AND I was moving home to my parents again at the age of 25. At first, I was so embarrassed, frustrated, and sad. 

With time, though, I realized that most of my negative emotions were a result of an arbitrary timeline for accomplishments that society has placed on me and a tunnel vision toward the ""end goal"" that I've been conditioned to believe I want/need. When I actually sat down and thought about things - I'm quite happy? I am excited to live in a house with a yard and dogs during covid when you can't really go anywhere, I get along with my parents well (they are one of the very few people I see in the age of Covid already), I have cut out toxic friends, and I'll save money to the point that I might be able to buy a house at the end of all of this. 

Everyone has different definitions of success and I have definitely been guilty of placing all my feelings of success on specific accomplishments (like graduating, getting a job, acing a test, etc.) So much so that I often lose sight of the life and relationships happening around me. At the end of the day, I think true success is being happy (as long as you aren't hurting others). And I can honestly say I'm happy.

,CasualConversation,"Well the past year or so has been pretty eventful for me. Getting sober. Trying to piece my life together after doing everything in my power to ruin it over the past three or four years. Relearning how to be an adult after being a drug addict for three years (I am currently 27).

It has been about three and a half years since I worked. Combine that with a drug related felony on my record and I was pretty intimidated when I started looking for work about nine months ago. 

With such a massive gap in employment history, a felony, and coronavirus going on I can't tell ya how many times I thought ""Man, who am I kidding, ain't nobody gonna hire me, may as well stay home,"".

I typically work as a waiter, for context. I have a stable home with family.

But I kept applying everywhere in town. Made it my full time job to find a job.

For a while I was right. Nobody wanted to hire me. I ever got rejected by Walmart. That's pretty damn hard to do. But I kept on walking.

That has changed today. I finally found a waiting position at a locally owned diner because the owner was in the same exact position I was about ten years ago. So he understood the struggle. We just sat and talked about life for about an hour over the interview earlier today.

I walked in there kind of hopeless, thinking it was just gonna be another failed interview to add to the pile of a couple dozen plus. I walked out with the job I need to finally get my life/financial situation back under control and an ear to ear grin.

I am actually crying right now I am so relieved that the biggest barrier in my immediate future has fallen. That I can put my energy into something with a purpose. Even just a few days ago, going back to a normal life seemed like nothing more than a distant day dream.

It ain't a day dream any more.

,CasualConversation,"I mean so often my dreams involve me leaving my house, but the surrounding environment always changes but I don't notice until I wake up, for example when I was in school I might have a dream where I'm late, but instead of walking all the way down the street, turning right and walking until I get to the right street, I walk half way down the street, take a turn that isn't there in real life, cross a bridge (no bridges normally), climb a wall, and go through completely unfamiliar spaces like its normal

I really want to know how my brain comes up with this stuff, why the wall? What would happen if I turn a corner and my brain hasn't decided what the next street looks like? In fact, how does my brain come up with everything so fast? I am very good at remembering my dreams but not once have I ever hit some kind of loading zone as far as I could remember 

Also surely I'm not the only person who has a wild dream, wakes up and thinks ""Where the hell did that come from?"" Some examples of my wild dreams involve:

* I live in a mansion with some weird people who were apparently my life long friends when suddenly the worlds gravity is shifted by an earthquake meaning that now everything falls to the side even though that's not how gravity works
* I jump off the top of this spiral staircase to avoid being eaten by what looks like a cross between a lungfish and one of those Kaiju from Pacific Rim (side note: everyone he ate before he got to me squirted out this peachy coloured goop instead of blood) only to wake up a ghost and the area I am in is the same place except it is now a train station but to get onto a train the conductor asks me to and I quote ""pick the lock on this frozen notebook with a key""
* My house gets overrun by giant hamsters (like 50% bigger than a husky) and they all look my real life hamster who is much bigger than the average hamster
* I need to get from my house to my college and back, but instead of taking the bus I have to walk, and the path is entirely new and made up, and my feet have no traction so I am sliding all over the place
* Several involve either me not being affected by gravity so i move about by pulling myself towards and pushing myself away from things while every body else kinda walks by acting like this is normal or me being able to ""airwalk"" where i essentially just sweep my feet back and forward until I am walking slightly above ground 
* Me and my family noticing lava slowly moving to the house and casually start packing to leave (we were not at all concerned it was like we ""shall take this? this can stay behind? Oh look the lava is almost here...eh we have plenty of time"")
* On 3 separate occasions I've had a dream where a film that I was at the time excited for came out and I went and actually saw it (like I was watching an actual film that if it really did come out it somewhat pass as the film I was looking forward to if I was drunk)
* I accidentally take the wrong medication, pass out on the bathroom floor, die, and basically have a dream where I'm dead and I cant see anything, hear anything or anything like that and the whole dream was basically just me and my thoughts as I'm like ""oh look, I'm dead, wow that's cool""

While doing so, his resume popped up for January (there was only one position opened). I know they only met me and one other candidate (now I’m sure it’s him!). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So that’s whyyyyyyyyyy. My 6th sense is still working.&lt;/p&gt;

Someone actually wants to hang out with me! Which I’m shocked about. I’m so happy. 

I don’t get invited anywhere anymore. Everyone says I’m nice &amp; friendly but no one wants to hang with me. It’s the same at work, they all have their mini parties and I don’t get invited out. I even post the rota in the little group chat we have each week. 

I get quite lonely tbh. I’ve noticed that more throughout lockdown. No one really snaps me, messages me or text me anymore. Sometimes I don’t feel like I exist to people once they step outside of work and college. Despite being one the top people in my workplace and I always help people in my college class. I’m always stuck in my house, which is quite sad for a twenty year old but oh well.

Anyway, I’m meeting a few college friends before we start college again after being off five months. I honestly can’t wait to socialise again.

I went with the Italian bread. It's boring, basic and doesn't have much character. So it's basically just like Italian people, except it's... well, bread. lol

I went with Monterey jack cheese. I like the spicy cheese with pepper and shit. I like spicy food in general. I did say I asked for a shit ton of jalapeño peppers in my sandwich, so you should know that already haha.

I'm gonna fart fire when I finish my sandwich, but that's the price I'll have to pay for a delicious subway sandwich.

I went with the cold cut meats, you know, ham, turkey, etc. I didn't go with any veggies like lettuce, tomatoes, onions, spinach, etc. I did get olives and peppers, and those were the only veggies I asked for on my sandwich.

Now why did I want olives? Because I want to suffer. I fucking HATE olives, but I'm gonna force myself to eat them, just like how my mom forced me to eat them when I was a kid. I kinda resent her for that still lol.

Not that it matters, but the kind lady who made the sandwich for me was a young looking blonde woman. She couldn't be older than 23 or so. There was also a young brunette male working there as well. I just thought that was interesting for whatever reason, mostly so I can fill the text requirements for this post.

Oh, the dressing! Yeah, I just asked them to drench that shit haha!

The sandwich was good (minus the olives,  but whatever).

He has multiple disorders, anxiety, paranoia, schizophrenia and psychosis. he's fine most of the time but sometimes something triggers him and he goes into an episode where these conditions present themselves. in this anxious, paranoid state he generally speaks what's on his mind and you just have to sit and talk with him until he feels better.

One night he has one of these episodes. I'm sitting with him, talking and he brings up one of his high school crushes (he's 21 at this point) and how he loved her. He then asks me I've ever loved anyone, I say yes and then he catches me off guard by asking ""you're straight, right?""

I'm bisexual, I'm not ashamed but I'm still in the closet. and while I'm sure that everyone in my family wouldn't care and would be supportive, I'm not sure about my brother. although he's never said anything outright homophobic, part of his psychosis makes him believe that he is either 1. the voice of god or 2. a god himself. this might mean that he might have a ""traditional"" view on homosexuality and the way he posed the question he posed the question made it sound like he wanted to hear one answer more than the other, so I hesitated telling him the truth.

I just lied and told him I was straight. Looking back it was probably the right thing to say, coming out probably would have worsened his episode but I still feel bad for lying to him.

,CasualConversation,"Musically, everything went pretty well. Despite my inner monologue telling me nonstop that I was gonna fuck up my set while I was setting up, I actually played and sang fairly well. And people actually liked it! I played some old folk songs, some covers of modern songs, and lots of originals. All of which were fairly well-received from the small audience of folks that stuck around to listen.

There were a lot of technical difficulties. My microphone decided it only wanted to work through one channel, which meant that folks with headphones only heard me through their left ear. I didn’t (and still don’t) know how to fix the issue, so I just told people to listen without headphones if they wanted a better experience.

Beyond that, you may have noticed I wrote “livestream(s)” in the title. This is because, while my intention was to do one stream, my connection kept crapping out on me, and Reddit kept crashing and ending my streams. It was storming outside where I am, so that may’ve been the issue. Then there was some “technical difficulties” thing on Reddit’s end, which is fine I guess. All in all, I did three shortish streams that were originally supposed to be one stream.

So, it was mostly a positive experience. I can’t really blame myself or anyone else for the connection issues. And, while it was a little stressful to worry about that, it’s nothing that’s gonna turn me off from streaming. The support and genuine interest I got from folks was enough to make this a really fun and exciting experience (some of the people from the first stream even came and found me again after I disconnected and restarted my stream).

I’m gonna try livestreaming again when I have the time! It was great!

&lt;p&gt;I hope our bond is something we continue to share as we all get older and have our own separate lives, or if not, if we can continue to maintain peace/never tarnish our relationship with one another.&lt;/p&gt;

Yeah, she’s rich. She’s got an unbelievable amount of privilege and money. There are terrible things happening to people all over the world. I know, I know. She’s also (probably) done some really shitty things. I don’t actually know, I’ve never really followed that family. 


She was born into something that I definitely could never understand. There was absolutely no chance of having a normal childhood for her.  At a young age she was pushed into the eye of the world and must have felt a constant demand to make money, gain attention, and be perfect.


Her sister is known for her curves and from a young age Kylie was exposed to millions of strangers online commenting on her body and appearance. As soon as she got old *enough* she started getting work done. She literally turned herself into a whole different person and the side by sides are unbelievable. 


I’ve spent a lot of time looking at Instagram pages for plastic surgeons but I’m no expert. In my opinion she’s gotten breast implants, liposuction, butt and hip implants/fillers/fat transfer, lip fillers, thread lift, eye lift, nose job, face fillers (chin and jaw)and Botox. I know she’s also denied all of that besides the lips. Even though all of these procedures were ultimately her choice, she was definitely pressured to change her body by the media and her family.


Her image, face, body, and life are all manufactured. She is not a businesswoman. She is a living business. Every photo on her Instagram is advertising something. Every one is posed. There are no candids and there aren’t any photos of her genuinely smiling or laughing. Every image is a combination of lighting rings, photographers, professional cameras, make up, and editing. 


Naively, before I ever noticed the editing and staging, I thought these would be semi-casual photos one of her rich friends took of her doing some cool shit. But actually go to her Instagram. She doesn’t do anything in her photos. She’s just standing there being hot, touching her own face or looking into the distance. 


Now zoom in. There are no pores. Not a hair out of place. I’m also newly obsessed with instagram pages that point out celebrities/influencers photoshop. If you look close enough you can see obvious signs of editing on walls and surfaces behind her. Unrealistic body proportions, bendy door frames, wavy bricks and curtains, etc etc etc. 


Imagine changing your **entire** body and face but it’s still not good enough and you have to have your photos edited at all times. Oh, and pay your own paparazzi. Do you think she even knows what she looks like anymore? I hope she has a really good therapist.

&lt;p&gt;Yeah, she’s rich. She’s got an unbelievable amount of privilege and money. There are terrible things happening to people all over the world. I know, I know. She’s also (probably) done some really shitty things. I don’t actually know, I’ve never really followed that family. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She was born into something that I definitely could never understand. There was absolutely no chance of having a normal childhood for her.  At a young age she was pushed into the eye of the world and must have felt a constant demand to make money, gain attention, and be perfect.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Her sister is known for her curves and from a young age Kylie was exposed to millions of strangers online commenting on her body and appearance. As soon as she got old &lt;em&gt;enough&lt;/em&gt; she started getting work done. She literally turned herself into a whole different person and the side by sides are unbelievable. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve spent a lot of time looking at Instagram pages for plastic surgeons but I’m no expert. In my opinion she’s gotten breast implants, liposuction, butt and hip implants/fillers/fat transfer, lip fillers, thread lift, eye lift, nose job, face fillers (chin and jaw)and Botox. I know she’s also denied all of that besides the lips. Even though all of these procedures were ultimately her choice, she was definitely pressured to change her body by the media and her family.&lt;/p&gt;

,CasualConversation,"The day that I started moving into my apartment for school it was my mom’s birthday. After we got most of the stuff for my place, my mom and step dad planned to go to a wine tasting and I went along. It was pretty interesting since I had never done it and I saw they had a small case of cigars in a humidor. I wanted to buy one and try but my stepdad said he had some at home to try.

About a week later,I went back home to take care of something else and got the opportunity to try it with my step father. I really love my step father, probably more than my real father and it was a great experience. I actually enjoyed the flavor that I can only describe as “spiced”. Cigar lovers would say they taste hints of a bunch of things but then again it was my first time. We only shared tiny cigar for around ten minutes then we put it out.

After I went back to my dorm I got a couple more from a smoke shop to try out. I got two that were recommended by the workers and they were longer than the one I smoked at home, length wise maybe 12 cm? 

Now, my stepfather isn’t a smoker by any means. He says he only smokes cigars three times a year and only for a few minutes, so rarely does it. I wanted to keep the same mentality and only do it after accomplishing something. After I finally got my place to a point I was happy I tried one of my new cigars. I went to the barbecue area of my apartment and sat down at the table under the small roof there. It honestly wasn’t as enjoyable with my step father. I also try to be courteous of others and even spray Febreeze after I’m done because of the smell. Like at home, I only did it for about ten minutes then put it out, wrapped in in plastic wrap and put it in a ziplock bag. Honestly the smell can still penetrate a bit so I was a bit worried that the smell would get stuck in the drawer I store them in. It kind of did but some Febreeze should fix it.

Here’s where I fucked up. Tonight I decided to smoke again because I was a bit stressed out and did a lot of stuff. I brought both cigars down and first re-lit the one I cut. After maybe 15 minutes I decided to put it out and try the other one to see what was different. I noticed that it was harder to suck in the smoke compared to the other one and I just decided that would smoke the entire thing because I felt like I was getting used to it. I just sat on a tree stump near the smoking area, listening to Lund and Convolk relaxing with this cigar. I must have been smoking that thing for 30 minutes and as I was reaching the end I noticed that I was wobbling as I walked and started to get a headache. There was still maybe 6 cm left but I decided enough was enough. 

I walked back to my room on the 3rd floor and just laid on the floor on my back, arms and legs spread like a star fish. It felt just like being drunk, head ache and feeling nauseous. My body felt so heavy and I didn’t want to move. It was as if I turned into a magnet and was stuck to the floor. Eventually, I got up and made myself a cup of water and went to the bathroom to throw up. I also fucked up way in advance for being dehydrated and not eating much during the day. When I threw up, it was just yellow water and I tried desperately to keep on refilling my cup. My roommate saw me and I told him to refill my cup because I turned into a magnet again in the bathroom. I drank three big cups of water, throwing up again and again expelling the poison from my body and constantly getting a runny nose. Every time I vomited the cigar taste came back mixing with the stomach acidity, making me expel again and again.

Eventually I got better and I told my roommate to warm up some leftover chicken for me. We sat down together to eat and I told him about my post in r/unpopularipinions. “Jango Fett is better than Boba Fett”. I am really proud of my reasoning actually so feel free to check it out if you want. I told him about other stupid stories from when I was in Elementary and Middle school too. Afterward he went back into his room to sleep because he has class tomorrow. 

I also told him that I was going to post my experience on Reddit to share as well. Right now I am finishing up typing this, siting on a chair with a pillow and a plate with scraps of roast chicken on it. Planning to eat more as soon as a post this.

Right now I have no desire to smoke cigars again and would rather throw them in the trash. If I just smoked for the normal ten minutes, ate and stayed hydrated I wouldn’t be in this situation. Who knows, maybe when I go back home I will smoke it again with my stepfather, but on the rare occasion when he does. I don’t want to even touch them right now.

The only people who would understand would be my psychiatrist and therapist, and my appointments with them are some ways away.

\--------------------------------

Background: I've been having a really hard time with depression and anxiety for the last while. Probably started around December when I started getting sad again. It progressively got worse and worse. My psychiatrist switched me to a new medication a few months ago after weaning me off my previous med. The whole process has been very hard and very long, and there were/are many times I didn't think I'd make it through the worst of it.

It's been a couple months now. We don't know if the medication is working yet, but there have been some good signs here and there -- a little bit of daily energy and motivation, some appetite, actually *feeling* things besides nothingness or sadness or anxiety, not spending the entire day in bed.

\--------------------------------

Related note: I think I have a fake me that I act out with other people and when I'm in public. Fake Me is fine and dandy, no depression here. Fake Me can engage with friends and family, customers and coworkers, and strangers in a friendly manner. Fake Me can smile and laugh at the appropriate times. Fake Me is very convincing, though other people certainly help maintain the act. No one knows I have depression unless I tell them.

\--------------------------------

My story is getting long. What I want to say is, I've never laughed a genuine laugh in this past year. I have smiled genuinely on occasion, usually at cute babies and animals (especially golden retrievers; they're so sweet and derpy). But yesterday I watched a video and I laughed so much, my stomach hurt and I had tears in my eyes and I made weird creaky choking sounds because I couldn't catch my breath. It was almost like my body was figuring out how to laugh again.

I can't get over it. I haven't laughed like that in ages. It didn't even occur to me how long it was since I last laughed until yesterday. I don't know if this means my new medication is starting to work. But it kind of feels like a positive sign. It felt... good (and surprising, too) to laugh like that.

If you've gotten to this point, I really appreciate you reading my story. Sorry for making it so long. And I hope it makes sense.

,CasualConversation,"I graduated from college this May, and finding a job has been near impossible, as I'm sure many of you know. Problem is, I'm an international student in the US, so no job meant potentially having to leave the country. I had some time to keep looking for a job, but the deadline was approaching and as more time passed, the pressure and stress made me let go of so many things.

I was stressed beyond belief and every time I thought about jobs, it felt like a cartoon anvil had landed on my chest. I found it hard to work out, eventually stopping for long periods of time, and my sleeping schedule became a bit of a wreck.

Last week, I landed a part time as a freelancer in my field, meaning not only is my status secured, thus giving me more time to look for a job, but it will be a lot easier to transition out of this job if I find a full time position in my field.

Shedding that stress has felt great. I started working out again, I try to go to sleep and wake up at reasonable hours, and most importantly, I don't feel like crying every time I think about a job. This change in mindset alone makes me feel so much more optimistic about my job search and gives me motivation to keep going.

Problem is, I&amp;#39;m an international student in the US, so no job meant potentially having to leave the country. I had some time to keep looking for a job, but the deadline was approaching and as more time passed, the pressure and stress made me let go of so many things.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was stressed beyond belief and every time I thought about jobs, it felt like a cartoon anvil had landed on my chest. I found it hard to work out, eventually stopping for long periods of time, and my sleeping schedule became a bit of a wreck.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Last week, I landed a part time as a freelancer in my field, meaning not only is my status secured, thus giving me more time to look for a job, but it will be a lot easier to transition out of this job if I find a full time position in my field.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Shedding that stress has felt great. I started working out again, I try to go to sleep and wake up at reasonable hours, and most importantly, I don&amp;#39;t feel like crying every time I think about a job. This change in mindset alone makes me feel so much more optimistic about my job search and gives me motivation to keep going.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am beyond ecstatic about this. I hope that if you&amp;#39;re reading this, whoever you are, also get some ~good vibes~ from this post and get some luck coming your way.&lt;/p&gt;

At this current point billy (death) is training jack to reach his full potential for the final showdown. The big bad boss fight, jack vs god. &lt;/p&gt;

,CasualConversation,"Hello guys. Basically, when I was in 1st grade (USA), my teacher was talking about the concept of tongue twisters. She talked about one of the most famous tongue twisters: ""How much wood could a woodchuck chuck if a woodchuck could chuck wood?"" She then showed us a video of an animated bird pecking at a tree, while people in the video sang the tongue twister.

Because of that, 6-year-old me assumed that a woodchuck was a type of bird, basically like a woodpecker. I thought this for my entire life. Whenever anybody would say the tongue twister, I would imagine a woodpecker in my head.

Until today, when my family and I (15M) were talking about our vacation plans for next summer (assuming that we're allowed to travel). We were talking about visiting a city that had a zoo. My mother was looking on her phone at the different animals that they had there. She said that they had a woodchuck, and I asked to see a photo of it on the zoo's website. She showed me her phone, and it showed a small brown animal that looked nothing like a woodpecker. I said, ""That's not a woodchuck."" She asked what I meant. I said that a woodchuck is the same thing as a woodpecker, which is a type of bird. We ended up talking about it, and I discovered that a woodchuck is the same thing as a groundhog, not any sort of bird. I was very embarrassed, but I guess I'm glad that I learned it.

So this COVID time is weird for us all. What particularly weirded me out was how my local shelter is handling pet adoptions.

Basically, I go through there pet list online and call them. Tell them which cats I was interested in and they tell me more information, if there is any. And then they schedule a phone interview. During the phone interview is when we decide if we want the cat or not.

So I'm basically signing myself up for a cat I never get to meet until it's basically in my ownership.

I'm a bit hesitant about this because I already felt weird about going through the pictures. Cause it's really hard to look at a cat picture and say, ""I like this cat over this cat"" without even knowing how they even like me.

I was playing some video games with friends when mom came to my room I said ""look! I got e-mail from google, it says that I have 500 subscriptions my channel"", I got interested, so I started looking at those old videos (I'm 17 now) and discavered that one of them has 572k views, I checked comments and 95% of them are from betwen 4 to 2 weeks ago.

,CasualConversation,"I don't have many written words from my parents, both having passed away 10 and 25 years ago respectively, but my mom did write something random in her journal a few days before she died and it's stayed with me every since. 

""I find even now, I keep having to re-invent myself.""

My mom was a sweet lady and street smart having worked her way from CNA to LVN and finally to an RN. And she had a tremendous level of emotional intelligence, but I just never knew her to be one to zoom out and see the bigger picture of life. And yet, that's exactly who she was, now that I think about it. 

When her and my dad first got divorced when I was 4, I remember she'd go and scrap paint from windows to earn extra money (having dropped out of school a year before graduating college). In high school she was told the ""best"" she'd ever be is a PE teacher, as if that's some sort of conciliatory prize and not a worthy career in it's own right. 

But she never accepted that was her limit. And through all the years of raising two crazy sons, she always managed to like herself somehow. Now, she was my favorite person in all the world, but liking one's self isn't something that was ever in my world view. You liked other people, but liking yourself?

Years go by, I settle into my career and found I had turned into a quite the asshole. Not because I was mean spirited really, just bored. I have a pretty profound ADHD and a moderate level of dyslexia, which means boredom is literally torture. So I'd poke and prod the system to see if I could make the gears turn this way or that way. It kind of made me feel like I had some power over the world. 

But it's annoying as hell to people. 

And people pick up on that over time. And I realized even though professionally I had stepped into the adult me, I was still a kid seeing if I could control things because I saw nuance and subtly better than a lot of folks. (Ex: You see someone doing something and hand them the missing ingredient before they ask, you finish their sentences or read out loud their inner monologue without their permission.)

I got to the point where I really didn't like that dude. He's a jerk. He's not genuine. He cares in his heart but what does that matter if it doesn't translate to being a helpful human outside the rib cage?

I'm not sure when it happened, but in the last year, I just stopped. I came to the end of that life and lifestyle and realized, though miraculously still married (my wife is tough non-bs kinda woman who reads me like a book and somehow still carries a God-like grace for me), I didn't like him. I didn't like that dude. 

And he needed to go. 

Perhaps that's why I write this. Because the conclusion I came to, is nothing about that dude got to come along with me after that point. Nothing about the way he thought, acted or behaved was worthy of crossing the bridge because it just isn't who I am called to be. I don't hate that kid (strange but I kind of talk about him in third person even in conversations) because he was trying to overcome a childhood of loneliness and death and loss and far away dreams. I appreciate him for it. But the manipulator, he can't come any further on the journey. He has to stay. 

He doesn't get to come. 

And that can be really hard I guess. Telling yourself that all those things that got you this far can't go on. Imagine leaving a child that overcame the perils of youth at the pearly gates of the good lands ahead. Imagine telling them, that it was always destined to be this way. (I'm a writer so I think and speak in analogies and metaphors a lot) 

The reason he can't come is because that kind of person I was always needed some external thing to fix himself. Someone had to say something right, do something right, and dear God in just the right way (I read subtly way waaaay to much, and humans don't work that way) in order for me to feel ""ok"". 

And maybe that's the take away from mom's last journal entry. It's on us to leave those pieces of ourselves behind that are destructive; to be introspective enough to see our journey from 10,000 feet up; and humble enough to say that those unhelpful parts, they can't come along where we are going. 

Somehow, though I guess I really haven't fished it all out yet, that lead to a day like today. Where I got up, began writing once more, and just genuinely liked my life. I'll be honest, the number of dark days of feeling forgotten were many. The angry nights of loathing people who wouldn't some how ""fix me"" or make me feel better were beyond counting. It was a hard climb to 10,000 ft. 

But I'm on the other side of that now. And I'm settled in my soul and in my skin. It took 36 years. And a lot of it I did alone. But, dear Reddit, it's possible. You don't have to stay who you are. You can overcome trauma, death, learning difficulties, and with kindness tell the worst parts of yourself ""Thank you. But you don't get to come any further.""

And I realized even though professionally I had stepped into the adult me, I was still a kid seeing if I could control things because I saw nuance and subtly better than a lot of folks. (Ex: You see someone doing something and hand them the missing ingredient before they ask, you finish their sentences or read out loud their inner monologue without their permission.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I got to the point where I really didn&amp;#39;t like that dude. He&amp;#39;s a jerk. He&amp;#39;s not genuine. He cares in his heart but what does that matter if it doesn&amp;#39;t translate to being a helpful human outside the rib cage?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m not sure when it happened, but in the last year, I just stopped. I came to the end of that life and lifestyle and realized, though miraculously still married (my wife is tough non-bs kinda woman who reads me like a book and somehow still carries a God-like grace for me), I didn&amp;#39;t like him. I didn&amp;#39;t like that dude. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And he needed to go. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Perhaps that&amp;#39;s why I write this. Because the conclusion I came to, is nothing about that dude got to come along with me after that point. Nothing about the way he thought, acted or behaved was worthy of crossing the bridge because it just isn&amp;#39;t who I am called to be. I don&amp;#39;t hate that kid (strange but I kind of talk about him in third person even in conversations) because he was trying to overcome a childhood of loneliness and death and loss and far away dreams. I appreciate him for it. But the manipulator, he can&amp;#39;t come any further on the journey. He has to stay. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He doesn&amp;#39;t get to come. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And that can be really hard I guess. Telling yourself that all those things that got you this far can&amp;#39;t go on. Imagine leaving a child that overcame the perils of youth at the pearly gates of the good lands ahead. Imagine telling them, that it was always destined to be this way. (I&amp;#39;m a writer so I think and speak in analogies and metaphors a lot) &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The reason he can&amp;#39;t come is because that kind of person I was always needed some external thing to fix himself. Someone had to say something right, do something right, and dear God in just the right way (I read subtly way waaaay to much, and humans don&amp;#39;t work that way) in order for me to feel &amp;quot;ok&amp;quot;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And maybe that&amp;#39;s the take away from mom&amp;#39;s last journal entry. It&amp;#39;s on us to leave those pieces of ourselves behind that are destructive; to be introspective enough to see our journey from 10,000 feet up; and humble enough to say that those unhelpful parts, they can&amp;#39;t come along where we are going. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Somehow, though I guess I really haven&amp;#39;t fished it all out yet, that lead to a day like today. Where I got up, began writing once more, and just genuinely liked my life. I&amp;#39;ll be honest, the number of dark days of feeling forgotten were many. The angry nights of loathing people who wouldn&amp;#39;t some how &amp;quot;fix me&amp;quot; or make me feel better were beyond counting. It was a hard climb to 10,000 ft. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But I&amp;#39;m on the other side of that now. And I&amp;#39;m settled in my soul and in my skin. It took 36 years. And a lot of it I did alone. But, dear Reddit, it&amp;#39;s possible. You don&amp;#39;t have to stay who you are. You can overcome trauma, death, learning difficulties, and with kindness tell the worst parts of yourself &amp;quot;Thank you. But you don&amp;#39;t get to come any further.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The sun sets on our seasons. And that can be hard. But the sun also rises. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And in that, well, I&amp;#39;m rooting for you.&lt;/p&gt;

,CasualConversation,"So this is my story. I was maybe in 11th grade, 16  years old and I happened to talk to a girl on a cam site. I didn't have a premium account and was using as a guest account where you could only have 10 free minutes or so of texting with a guest + a number username and then a sign in box would pop. So I came across this girl, there was no traffic on her page, I was the first one to join, so there was only me and her and so she was replying me. She was young and just simply beautiful. She was just sitting wearing some dress can't remember exactly what but looked simple and charming. She had nothing fancy on but still looked charming. I had no intentions to talk dirty or anything but just casual. She seemed so decent and I felt bad that she had to do cam stuff for some reason. We were talking normally and I told her that I make music and there she replied she does too! And she actually named me some DAWS (Digital Audio Workstation, softwares to produce music) so I could tell she was actually into something creative. I was so amused and got so interested to get to know her more, her real story! 

Now I'm 20 and I've been checking her page sometimes even to this day but she hasn't come online in long time. I believe she was last online when I happen to talked to her that day.

And that way, he can say it to her silently as he is walking her down the aisle without crying.

Thought this was a sweet sentiment. To be able to tell your child that you loved them silently, in your own secret way.

So I tried it with my son. Lying on the same pillow, before we fell asleep, I gently tapped his head (with my head) three times, and whispered, “ I love you.” One tap per word.

He quickly caught on and repeated the process.  

My heart sighed. What a moment.

I repeated the process: I *tap* love *tap* you *tap*

He reciprocated the sentiment. But with more of a bump than a tap. And giggled.

Still in bliss, I responded with bumps also.

His turn. A little louder and harder on the head he told me our secret message. And I replied likewise.

This back and forth continued and escalated for the next 5 minutes. It quickly became an “I LOVE YOU” screaming match, with head butts and resulted in red foreheads.

I offered to because I could afford it and it'll be our first time as friends going out and seeing a movie again since before the pandemic. It was a pain in the ass to get them but it was worth it. I even got extra tickets in case they wanted to bring their siblings or any other friends we had. I just found out this morning that my friend most excited to see the movie went and saw it with his other group of friends last night. This isn't the first time he's done shit like this. Now, I expressed my unhappiness with the fact he just did that when we're literally all seeing it together in two days. My other friend said that its just how I feel and he can do what he wants. Obviously he can do what he wants, but it's the principal of this shit to me. I'm almost ready to go give these tickets to some random stranger and tell them to go enjoy themselves.

My real friends have all been here or there, around when they want to be. I often try to encourage hanging out, even going so far as offering to buy food. If we all make it out on a day together, its extremely lucky. We have an instagram chat where we talk about gaming news or movies and whatever other stuff guys our age talk about.(We all really love movies)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The reason I&amp;#39;m even here is because last week I bought each of my friends a ticket to Tenet for this weekend. I offered to because I could afford it and it&amp;#39;ll be our first time as friends going out and seeing a movie again since before the pandemic. It was a pain in the ass to get them but it was worth it. I even got extra tickets in case they wanted to bring their siblings or any other friends we had. I just found out this morning that my friend most excited to see the movie went and saw it with his other group of friends last night. This isn&amp;#39;t the first time he&amp;#39;s done shit like this. Now, I expressed my unhappiness with the fact he just did that when we&amp;#39;re literally all seeing it together in two days. My other friend said that its just how I feel and he can do what he wants. Obviously he can do what he wants, but it&amp;#39;s the principal of this shit to me. I&amp;#39;m almost ready to go give these tickets to some random stranger and tell them to go enjoy themselves. Idk, is it just me? Am I being petty?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Edit: Tickets were $21/each and there&amp;#39;s about 5 of us going. I bought 7 tickets.&lt;/p&gt;

,CasualConversation,"I'm not quite sure how to word it but that's the closest phrasing I can think of.

But basically this happens mostly when I'm angry. Fear and anxiety are actually pretty easy to push to the side with a ""I'll deal with it when it happens"" but anger is where this weird detachment is most noticeable.

When I'm mad the way I try to control it is by calmly refusing to let it control me and sort of push it back so I can pick apart why I'm angry and essentially talk myself out of my rage. 

But in a pinch I can just sort of push it away. It still exists as a burning feeling in my chest but I can completely control my face, voice and actions until I have the time and space to analyze it and pick it apart if it doesn't dissipate on its own.

&lt;p&gt;But basically this happens mostly when I&amp;#39;m angry. Fear and anxiety are actually pretty easy to push to the side with a &amp;quot;I&amp;#39;ll deal with it when it happens&amp;quot; but anger is where this weird detachment is most noticeable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But in a pinch I can just sort of push it away. It still exists as a burning feeling in my chest but I can completely control my face, voice and actions until I have the time and space to analyze it and pick it apart if it doesn&amp;#39;t dissipate on its own.&lt;/p&gt;

Obviously there are some asshats but the good has faaaar outweighed the bad. To those of you who go out of your way to support others especially small channels like mine, I love you.&lt;/p&gt;

I was playing pickleball and it was like 9 pm and I had been out playing since 7:20-ish. The game can be more intense than it sounds.

Anyway, a random person that I paired up with asked me if I was tired and I said yes. They just laughed and said there was no way I could be tired at my age (16) since I “wasn’t even in my 20s yet.” Is this true? Does being tired become much much worse? 

Do I truly not have a perspective on what it means to be tired? Because I’ve fallen into depressions before and felt like I could fulfill an eternal slumber if my environment allowed me (parents and responsibilities). Why do adults feel the need to invalidate what I find to be true about *myself?*

Because I’ve fallen into depressions before and felt like I could fulfill an eternal slumber if my environment allowed me (parents and responsibilities). Why do adults feel the need to invalidate what I find to be true about &lt;em&gt;myself?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I asked my dad (who is 40 something) if it is true that you get more tired the older you get and he said yes. What am I missing??&lt;/p&gt;

I don't want to disappoint her (because it's troublesome to deal with guilt-tripping), so I decided that I'll just add this person (but I haven't yet).

She said she needs to look up my godmothers and godfathers so that she can remember them and, she said, so that I can add them. Add a lot of people that I don't even know.

I'm a really private person, with a really small circle of friends and very wary of strangers. I don't really add people that much.

I called this morning to cancel my trial so I won’t forget and the conversation made me wonder if I was on a hidden camera tv show. 
I call, tell her I want to cancel, that I don’t use it blah blah. She’s like okay- but let me deal ya about this deal we have right now....so I politely listen and say no thanks. And then she says mmmmmk we have this platinum deal and starts in...and I’m thinking wow okay, so I wait, same thing....”mmmmmk” and then asking me what kind of music I listen to. And I tell her I appreciate the hustle because I’m also a salesperson but I wasn’t expecting the call to take this long and I have to get to work oddly enough; get hit with the “mmmmk” and asks AGAIN what kind of music I like. I am incredulous and stammering at this point and had to just back away from the phone and hang up when she wouldn’t take no for an answer.

Basically, I got an apple laptop back in 2018. Pretty cool I like apple products(pls no unnecessary arguments about apple or any other brand im mentioning please lol)It's been pretty good except we all know Apple laptops are mostly for work and browsing normally.

The problem with this is that I don't just like working. I like doing lives on my laptop(just for my friends)and I love playing games. I'm mostly a console gamer but I do play some games that are supported by OS; they're cool except my laptop fans will go crazy. This becomes even WORSE if I want to play and go live. It just won't work. At all. The lag will go crazy. And there's so many windows games I want to try but since I have OS it won't work....I don't like playing online or multiplayer games too much but there are still so many i'd love to try.

I don't think i'd want a desktop, but I was looking at some pc laptops. Please please keep in mind im not educated about windows or PCs at ALL, if I were to get one i'd get one pre built, i've tried hard to research before but it seems im hopeless lol. I was looking at this laptop by razer [https://www.razer.com/gaming-laptops/Razer-Blade-Stealth-13/RZ09-03102E22-R3U1](https://www.razer.com/gaming-laptops/Razer-Blade-Stealth-13/RZ09-03102E22-R3U1) and I think it'd be pretty cool for my taste(?). Would a 13 inch gaming laptop be good? My apple laptop is a 15inch, and I love the size but would it be better to also get a 15 inch razer? [https://www.razer.com/gaming-laptops/Razer-Blade-15/RZ09-03286E22-R3U1](https://www.razer.com/gaming-laptops/Razer-Blade-15/RZ09-03286E22-R3U1) would this be better? Would I also get a separate keyboard and mouse for it? Is razer even a good pc laptop brand? I just know it's popular. I don't need something equivalent to a 5k pc build, just something that'll work but also not be barely running.

Even if I got a windows laptop, I really have no idea how windows works. I see a lot of people who say you have to do a lot of prep before you actually start using it; I don't know what that means, or what kind of prep I would do. And once I prep it I'll probably be really stuck on how to use a lot of features and how to keep security in check.

,CasualConversation,"Sitting here in  the dark, the silence is somehow deafening, my mind wanders to all the dark places, thoughts which I tried so hard to bury deep down. I feel like crying my heart out,  but tears won't come, it's almost as if I've uncovered a void in me, leaking pain and hurt, everything seems pointless.

I just realised a few things about me that I would like to share because it hurts to think alone anymore:

• I have to stop thinking that a relationship, a significant one is a solution to all my life problems. I have been a hopeless romantic, longing for someone who clearly would never like me back, it breaks my heart to pieces, but rather than learning my lessons I would go on getting my heart broken again and again.

Almost any stick deodorant you can buy has its dial at the bottom of the package to push the product out at the top. As the deodorant goes through its life, its center of gravity slowly moves to the top of the package, thus becoming easily unbalanced. 

I can't tell you how many times my deodorant has fallen off my bathroom shelf, knocking a ton of things off my sink. I can't just store the stick upside-down, either, since the thoughtful designers at Dove for Men decided to bevel the top of the cap to an angle, removing its flat surface.

I am baffled as to why deodorant sticks don't empty at the bottom instead of the top. I'm guessing it's due to consumer expectations of the norm, and consumers tend to be fickle when it comes to novel package designs.

&lt;p&gt;I can&amp;#39;t tell you how many times my deodorant has fallen off my bathroom shelf, knocking a ton of things off my sink. I can&amp;#39;t just store the stick upside-down, either, since the thoughtful designers at Dove for Men decided to bevel the top of the cap to an angle, removing its flat surface.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am baffled as to why deodorant sticks don&amp;#39;t empty at the bottom instead of the top. I&amp;#39;m guessing it&amp;#39;s due to consumer expectations of the norm, and consumers tend to be fickle when it comes to novel package designs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Like I said, very much a first-world problem, but arrrrgh.&lt;/p&gt;

It's minimal, and it's only probably one panel out of a whole chapter, but it stuck with me, and it stuck with thousands of people.

It's in the epilogue, I think. They are showing what became of the beloved characters. One of them was Oikawa. It showed him as a member of an argentinean volleyball team of San Juan, a fictional team, but still. 

The haikyuu fans of argentina were *ecstatic*. Seriously, my twitter feed was full of people making memes of Oikawa saying their slang, eating their food... Just, celebrating their culture and Oikawa being a part of it! They were so happy! And it made *me* happy! 

A fanartist drew Oikawa with a t-shirt of the actual San Juan volleyball team, and people were more happy! It got so much traction that the team's twitter account noticed it, and a few days later the coach and some players made a video welcoming their newest member, Oikawa! I think they even made a t-shirt with ""Oikawa"" on the back! It was so much fun seeing all these people being happy about a fictional anime character joining a fictional argentinean team.

I'm not argentinean, I don't watch volleyball matches other than the ones that appear on the anime. Oikawa isn't even my favorite character. But damn, seeing all these people celebrate that? It was fantastic. Maybe it's because we latinos don't get positive spotlight on anime, or even other media... But I'm still happy nonetheless.

,CasualConversation,"My old elementary school that I attended in first and second grade has been putting an annual Halloween and Christmas dance open to the general public for the past 20 years now. During my junior year of high school, I volunteered to be their new DJ for the Halloween dance as I thought it'd be a fun thing to do.

For my first gig at the Halloween dance my junior year, I hooked onto the school's WiFi and used YouTube with an ad blocker to get all my songs. I did things this way because it allowed me to play any song and take requests from everyone. I tried to keep my playlist across these genres: hip-hop, R&amp;B, reggae, pop, dance crazes, and reggaeton, while specifically avoiding rock or country unless it was a top 40 hit. I also tended to stick to songs from like the 1990s-2012, outside of requests. What ended up happening is that I had an okay crowd on the dancefloor, but the school's WiFi malfunctioned halfway through the night, and songs ended up freezing.

For my next gig at the Christmas dance, I wasn't even gonna do it originally. I showed up about halfway through the night just to check it out and they just told me to get up there and play songs off one of their phones. I ended up just cycling through random songs and keeping the dance floor filled mostly, although it wasn't very interesting to be completely honest.

Then for my third gig at the Halloween dance my senior year, I had the best gig in my career ever. I had spent countless weeks asking people around, looking at the Billboard charts, and working on building up an amazing playlist spanning across the six aforementioned genres, and of course made sure to download it to my laptop to avoid having technical difficulties again. When I was behind that table that night, everybody was up there jamming for I'm gonna say 80-90% of the night, and it was just awesome to see. People were happy with how I did things and I felt proud of myself.

And for my gig at the Christmas dance my senior year, I kinda started going downhill. I mostly just replayed some of the songs from the Halloween dance that were proven hits before, and I also just kinda threw some songs I had been listening to lately as well. Needless to say, it wasn't all that great, I only had people on the dance floor like 60-70% of the time, and most of that was for dance craze songs. Also, at the end of the night I announced my retirement because I'd be moving away for college the next year and unable to do this again.

Then finally, I had one last unexpected gig for a new Valentine's dance they did last February in my senior year. I wasn't even supposed to do it at all, nor did I really want to, but I again decided to go check it out. They just ended up calling me over to the table and letting me do my thing again, which I accepted reluctantly. I only had my phone and the songs downloaded on it, and the laptop of the lady they hired to DJ with her downloaded songs. We shared the job, but it was mostly me doing it to be completely honest. When I was up there, I ended up cycling through a lot of the same pop and reggae songs over and over again, mostly from my phone, and dance craze songs. I only held a crowd on the dance floor about 40-50% of the time, and it was mostly just a bunch of really little kids. This was the lowest point in my career, and the fact it's probably the last one I'll ever do for them makes me sad. Just about everyone *hated* me as a DJ after that night.

,CasualConversation,"I don’t know why this popped into my head but I realized that I don’t think my friend cares about me. If you look into my post history a while back I was talking about a long time friend I’ve had that has started to just be rude and just generally mean towards me. The thing that made me want to post this is something he said a month ago. It was in a group chat with me and my other friends. “He’s going through another one of his ‘episodes’” This was a comment on me not wanting to really talk to anyone or hang out. It’s the way he air quotes episodes. And just the general feel of him using episodes. This isn’t just an episodic thing. This is directly after times where he’s hurt me deeply. Or I just feel deeply hurt in general.  It’s really not that hard to see. 

There’s other comments on me trying to just not talk. “I know how you get” “I know. You’re just like that” These are directly after me saying I don’t want to hang out. 

There’s also the thing with asking why. Whenever I say I don’t really want to do something, he just immediately asks why? I get asking why for some things but everything is excessive. I just end up saying I just dont want to or I don’t feel like it. Then he just gets annoyed and asks why thats not a real reason. I hate it. 

Looking back on these things while writing this hurts. Not because the memories themselves hurt it’s just my reaction to them. Thinking about this feels like nothing. I hate it. It’s like how I feel towards my dad. Nothing. No hatred or love or fear or care. Just nothing. It hurts. Because, I don’t want to care about this friendship anymore. He’s shown how hurtful he can be. He can be racist, homophobic. He’s not a good person. But he’s so deep in my other friendships that leaving him means hurting other relationships. I don’t want that. That I do feel something towards. Fear and frustration. I’m not asking for advice just thought of this that’s all. I’m just scared. Scared on how and when I’m going to leave him. I don’t want to hurt him. I don’t like hurting people.

,CasualConversation,"It was yesterday around noon. I was smoking a sigaret outside on the terrace. It's on top of the apartment downstairs. Through the cracks I can see my neighbour's backyard. Bert has a lot of old stuff laying around. Over twenty buckets, three tables, one chair, a small bike without wheels and (part of) a boat. It's a little messy, so to say. 

He also has a dog. Her name is Misty. He takes her everywhere he goes. From the community centre to the market, Misty is going. Bert lost his wife this year, so I think that's the reason he's been taking the dog with him at all times. It's pretty sad to see a guy that age all alone in his chair. That one chair. Sometimes he sets it at another one of the tables. But he looks sad either way.

It's been five months since Bert had to say goodbye to his wife of fifty years. He's been surprisingly calm and strong about it. He doesn't accept help because he's ""not the one that's sick"". So we just try to keep an eye on him while he just does his thing. Most of the time that means playing with his dog.

So yesterday, apparently, it was washing-day. This is something that happens every week since the heat started kicking in. Bert brings out this small tub, towels, a brush and shampoo. Misty knows what's up when these products enter the backyard. Before you know it she's right there, in the tub, waiting for Bert to let the water in. It's adorable to watch. Sometimes he sings to her, or at least he tries. 

I took the last sip of my coffee and wanted to go inside, when I heard him talking to her. I could see he was shampooing her. So carefully. ""I know you miss her too."" He took out the brush and started brushing her. ""But we have to stay strong, we have to keep our heads up high."" Softly he lifted her head up with his finger. He was holding back his tears. So was I. With the mug still in my hand I was just standing there. Crying. I wanted to say something to him. But what the f do you say to a 72 year old grieving man?

1. A level headed and knowledgeable, but still cool and confident boy. The unofficial leader of the trio, and the one who usually breaks up the other two's fights and keeps them focused on the task or situation at hand.
2. A cool and confident, yet arrogant and mouthy boy. The toughest and most assertive of the trio, and the one who usually escalates or hastens situations. Friend of kid no. 1 but frenemy of kid no. 3, who he often gets into arguments with.
3. A *slightly* shy and submissive, yet morally compassionate and also somewhat knowledgeable girl. The friendliest of the trio and the one who usually calms things down or brings out a more happy tone to the situation, and also is sort of an idea girl. Argues with kid no. 2 a lot. She also has a stuffed cat she carries around, who can sometimes talk and move sentiently.

These three kids regularly spend their time hanging out at a treehouse in kid no. 1's yard, which is fully decked out with couches, tables and chairs, a toy chest full of toys and other junk, a mini fridge/freezer filled with snacks and drinks, a bookshelf full of books, and a TV with a cable hookup and video game console.

The basic premise is that each long episode starts with the trio in their treehouse usually engaged in some kind of activity or having some sort of problem. They'll turn on the TV, open up a book, or pull something out of the toy chest, and it'll glow. Upon trying to examine this glowing thing more closely, they end up transported to a world pertaining to whatever was glowing.

Here, they start to become familiar to the environment and its inhabitants, and learn about some sort of upcoming event or conflict happening in this world. The trio will soon end up getting involved in some sort of goal that they have to figure out how to accomplish by navigating this new world and learning about it, meeting a lot of interesting characters along the way.

Along the way, the person or force behind this problem will usually try to make some kinda effort to finish the trio off. This eventually results in a final showdown where the trio must defeat the villain so they can accomplish their goal.

When the trio is done with all that, they are usually presented with a way to be sent back home to the treehouse.

&lt;p&gt;Here, they start to become familiar to the environment and its inhabitants, and learn about some sort of upcoming event or conflict happening in this world. The trio will soon end up getting involved in some sort of goal that they have to figure out how to accomplish by navigating this new world and learning about it, meeting a lot of interesting characters along the way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Along the way, the person or force behind this problem will usually try to make some kinda effort to finish the trio off. This eventually results in a final showdown where the trio must defeat the villain so they can accomplish their goal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When the trio is done with all that, they are usually presented with a way to be sent back home to the treehouse. Once there, they use their new knowledge to solve whatever problem they were having at the beginning of the episode.&lt;/p&gt;

,CasualConversation," My older brother is my inspiration and best friend. The morning he left for college, I was so happy for him.

He's off to a great college, for real, and is determined to finish. I have a feeling he will.
 My mom has never gotten more than a highschool education, except for a semester of training for her current job, because my dad never let her. 
 My dad attended a tad of military college and participated in the military over going to jail before I was born. I'm not sure how far he got, but I do know he never got a job that would have used anything above highschool education. He also died a bit before a year ago, so that's some added stress onto him.
 My oldest brother dropped out of college.

,CasualConversation,"I got to hang out with some of my best friends today. It was a wonderful treat. I’ve seen less of them over the last few years as we’ve been getting older and busier with work/family/relationships/relocating/life.

Covid hit and I saw them even less. But today, we rallied for some beers on the patio of my friend’s recently purchased HOUSE (he’s makin it dude!), and I was lovin it. No matter how much time passes between our visits, we dive right back in like it was only yesterday we were staying up all night every night being silly kids.

I think my friends are all very smart, and they always have something to teach me. It’s rare when I’m sure enough about something that my friends don’t already know about that I’m willing to speak confidently about it. I don’t want to misinform anyone, and I have a terrible memory, so I don’t retain a lot of good conversational facts most of the time. Though I do voice my opinions vehemently, I’ll reel it in for some reflection if presented with information I hadn’t considered. 

Anyway, we started talking about food, then breakfast food, then hangover food...and I love food, and breakfast, and I don’t love hangovers, but I’m experienced. I’ve also been learning how to cook over the past couple years after never cooking and being raised by a single mom with a microwave, so my knowledge of cooking is much better than it used to be. 

I was excited to share my new favorite hangover/breakfast food: miso soup. 

Disclaimer: I do my best and mix miso paste into whatever broth, stock, or water I have for the base. I am no miso pro, but I know what miso is. 

While sharing my new favorite hangover breakfast, one of my friends mentioned that miso involves bones. And I said miso does not have bones. And I knew it. And they contested my knowledge instead of accepting that I knew what I was talking about. Not in a mean or challenging way, but they didn’t simply believe me when I first said it. Which made me question myself, but miso is not bones. 

I told them miso is typically made from fermented soybeans. Which it is. And I knew that. And they did not. And I said you could make miso soup using bone broth, and it would be delicious, but miso is made from fermented soybeans. 

And I stood by it. Yeah, my brain did that thing where it questions it’s own knowledge and considers that maybe I’m wrong, miso might involve a bone product, I’m a white woman from the Midwest wtf do I know about miso. And it probably came off to my friends as me not being positive that miso is made from fermented soybeans. But I’m trying not to care. 

My friend was like, “I’m pretty sure miso involves bones,” and my other friend corroborated him saying something like, “Yeah, I think miso soup has bones,” and I was like...”Maybe miso soup could have bone broth. That sounds delicious. But miso is fermented soybeans and the miso paste I use has no bones.” I use quotation marks but I’m paraphrasing.

I love making miso soup. Miso has no bones. I corrected my friends, and I don’t know if they believed me, but I know it. 

I don’t know much, and if I was informed that miso has bones, I’d research it and eventually change my understanding. But it was nice to know something. I wish they’d have believed me, but I’m still working on knowing things and being confident about knowing them. So I don’t blame them.

We live in a crazy world filled with people who think they know the truth of all things. I don’t blame my friends for questioning the truth of my miso info.

No matter how much time passes between our visits, we dive right back in like it was only yesterday we were staying up all night every night being silly kids.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think my friends are all very smart, and they always have something to teach me. It’s rare when I’m sure enough about something that my friends don’t already know about that I’m willing to speak confidently about it. I don’t want to misinform anyone, and I have a terrible memory, so I don’t retain a lot of good conversational facts most of the time. Though I do voice my opinions vehemently, I’ll reel it in for some reflection if presented with information I hadn’t considered. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyway, we started talking about food, then breakfast food, then hangover food...and I love food, and breakfast, and I don’t love hangovers, but I’m experienced. I’ve also been learning how to cook over the past couple years after never cooking and being raised by a single mom with a microwave, so my knowledge of cooking is much better than it used to be. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was excited to share my new favorite hangover/breakfast food: miso soup. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Disclaimer: I do my best and mix miso paste into whatever broth, stock, or water I have for the base. I am no miso pro, but I know what miso is. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While sharing my new favorite hangover breakfast, one of my friends mentioned that miso involves bones. And I said miso does not have bones. And I knew it. And they contested my knowledge instead of accepting that I knew what I was talking about. Not in a mean or challenging way, but they didn’t simply believe me when I first said it. Which made me question myself, but miso is not bones. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I told them miso is typically made from fermented soybeans. Which it is. And I knew that. And they did not. And I said you could make miso soup using bone broth, and it would be delicious, but miso is made from fermented soybeans. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And I stood by it. Yeah, my brain did that thing where it questions it’s own knowledge and considers that maybe I’m wrong, miso might involve a bone product, I’m a white woman from the Midwest wtf do I know about miso. And it probably came off to my friends as me not being positive that miso is made from fermented soybeans. But I’m trying not to care. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My friend was like, “I’m pretty sure miso involves bones,” and my other friend corroborated him saying something like, “Yeah, I think miso soup has bones,” and I was like...”Maybe miso soup could have bone broth. That sounds delicious. But miso is fermented soybeans and the miso paste I use has no bones.” I use quotation marks but I’m paraphrasing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I love making miso soup. Miso has no bones. I corrected my friends, and I don’t know if they believed me, but I know it. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don’t know much, and if I was informed that miso has bones, I’d research it and eventually change my understanding. But it was nice to know something. I wish they’d have believed me, but I’m still working on knowing things and being confident about knowing them. So I don’t blame them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We live in a crazy world filled with people who think they know the truth of all things. I don’t blame my friends for questioning the truth of my miso info. And my goal is to learn, retain, and share whatever information my lil brain can process. Miso yo&lt;/p&gt;

,CasualConversation,"So as some of you may know from my last few posts my last job was pretty miserable. I was getting yelled at by college students and their mothers( sometimes fathers as well) a few times a week. It was horrific. It was hard to sleep at night and I literally would become sick to the point I had to call out because my job was so stressful. I finally decided I had had enough and quit.

Fast forward to me getting yelled at. A tenant was mad that I was knocking on his door at 1:30AM at an apartment complex due to the property managers wanting us to begin drying the place so mold would not grow. He cussed me out and slammed the door in my face. Instead of being angry I realized first of all it probably would be frustrating to be woken at 1:30AM to have equipment set up. The second thought I had is that at my job that is the first time I had even a slightly negative experience. my first month and a half at this new company. I literally was chuckling and smiling as I walked away from the guys apartment.

If you hate your job I just ask that you keep putting those applications in. Also try to decide if you are working your job because you feel like you should be working in that field OR if it actually someplace you can truly thrive in. A new job where you are valued and that doesn't cause you to hate your life is an amazing thing. I went from a set schedule 8-5 job to becoming a water technician and dealing with flooded houses, mold damages and a whole lot more. I deal with deep cleaning, mold, and I was even cleaning air ducts today. I wake up at 6:30AM and am so happy to be alive and realize that working a job with manual labor is my kind of job.  

Also for anyone wanting an update from my last post... sadly my new friend found an opportunity in another part of the country and followed his heart and left the city I live in.

There is no question social media sites have some good; that is a lot of the reason most of us still have Facebook accounts or instagram accounts - to stay connected with our friends and family. However, it seems like these sites have gone far past their originally intended purpose.

It was really starting to run me down seeing people my age graduating or already in decent jobs. I held off for so long because I hadn't (and still really don't) know what I wanted to do after. It didnt help that the application process, and applying for aid and scholarships just looks so intimidating. Finally I've applied to a community college and for financial aid and it feels amazing!

I’ve had some recently that I’ve really enjoyed remembering but it’s 00:45am at the time I’m writing this and I just had one that scared myself awake. 

In these dreams I sometimes switch from one characters perspective to another and in the one just now the character I was in control of had a case of PTSD from when he was a child. I’ll go into as much detail as I can so this might be long and from my/the characters perspective .

‘When I was a child my home was broken into by a man in a mask who tortured and killed my parents. I thought I grew out of it but was out for some drinks with my friends for their 30th birthday and in the bar we’re in there was some rising tension between a few people. I helped escort one of them outside before a fight broke out and was having to push him back to their car and telling him to cool down. We got to his car and the man went round to the passenger side door, reached into his car and pulled something out. He wasn’t facing me but pulled a thin elastic strap over his head a turned around. I saw a flash of white from a mask, it was the same mask from my childhood. His cold black eyes looked at me as a wave of calmness washed over him. I let out a scream of genuine terror and fear as I collapsed to the ground’.

Next up? Spanish. Worked at first, but I still encountered numerous students that kind of understood me. Sucks, but very well.

My next thought was first to try something else other than answering in foreign languages. But then a friend texted me, who’s parents are both unable to hear and speak, therefore using sign language.

So almost like an imaginary lightbulb, it made “ding”! Let’s try it out.

Some YouTube videos later my first encounter happened, and I tried it out. Almost a second later, they waved me off. Awesome!

&lt;p&gt;My next thought was first to try something else other than answering in foreign languages. But then a friend texted me, who’s parents are both unable to hear and speak, therefore using sign language.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So almost like an imaginary lightbulb, it made “ding”! Let’s try it out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some YouTube videos later my first encounter happened, and I tried it out. Almost a second later, they waved me off. Awesome!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well, fast forward a month later, I enrolled a sign language class teaching my country’s equivalent to ASL. I am full on trying to learn it as another foreign language. Don’t care how often I will use it, I wanna learn it and maybe master it!&lt;/p&gt;

I separated from ex-wife last year and divorced earlier this one. We were together 10 years. It was one of the hardest points of my life.

I struggled a lot with feeling I was unlovable or broken or a bad partner. I’ve spent a ton of time working with my therapist to grow and deal with these feelings. Today, I’m a generally pretty happy and confident person.

But I still struggle a bit with physical contact. I can have a great date, but as soon it is nearing the end I stutter and stumble over my words. 

I’ve been talking to this one girl for three months. It’s been moving really slowly because of COVID. We are both careful. Today was our third date. It went really well. At the end, I was awkward as expected and she still wanted to kiss me. It was great. First time I’ve kissed someone in a year. And she’s a great person.

&lt;p&gt;Am I regretting that I introduced the game? Definitely not. But am I craving for snuggles? It’s a yes for me. The baby’s been kicking a lot too (me preggo) and I want him to feel it too so I hope he wins soon :)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So how about you guys? Anything you’re waiting for?&lt;/p&gt;

,CasualConversation,"So tonight it happened again! (2nd time so far since I joined Reddit). I've been called fishy &amp; a catfish simply because some people find it hard to believe that I don't look 31 yo from the picture I sent them. They then asked me to do verification photos or video call verification right off the bat, literally from the first ever conversation we had with each other. Although I explained myself pretty clear saying I would be up for video calls in the future when we get to know each other better, that didn't seem to help unfortunately. Their reason is the bigger deal I make of it, makes me so suspicious?!? I'm not making it a big deal, I just simply want to find someone who wants to be my friend and be around me for who I am as a person, not how I look like. Is that too much to ask for?  

YES appearances do matter! But only when it comes to romance, like if I'm looking to date you, yes we must be physically attracted to each other as well. But if all I want is friendship &amp; nothing more, would a verification picture be worth more than losing someone genuinely want to get to know you? 

The funny thing was I never even once asked them to send me a photo of themselves because they have a small photo on their profiles. That wouldn't have been necessary anyway. I believe in putting a face to the name but when it comes to your motive &amp; morals being questioned, I feel really uncomfortable. I'm very stubborn &amp; the more they want me to do it, the higher chance that will never happen. 

I am  a 31 yo asian who happens to have a bit of a good gene so I don't age naturally but I am old in so many ways. I usually use the excuse ""I'm old"" in a lot of things, I also am an old soul because I love handwritten letters &amp; notes. I still keep all the letters I exchanged with people I met from the internet over 15 years ago. I take good care of myself &amp; I have a very comfortable life with no stress from work or family drama. I have my own place, am financially independent. I have a life, a somewhat good one you know? I have much better things to spend time on than catfishing some random strangers on reddit. 

That being said, I have only had one Reddit account for 3 years. I have met a few people in the past that I had multiple video calls with, even met up with some irl. There was one person whom I used to consider a very good friend of mine &amp; we used to fall alseep together or spent countless hours on a video call.

Has any of you experienced something similar? That you just find someone interesting from their posts &amp; want to get to know them better but then they turn out to be super paranoid that you end up losing all interest &amp; even a bit of faith in humanity?",t2_43udk8c,False,,0,False,"When your intentions are pure, you didn't lose anyone, they lost you!",[],r/CasualConversation,,False,6,,0,,False,t3_igfzyk,False,dark,1.0,,public,5,0,{},,False,[],,False,False,,{},,False,5,,False,,,False,,[],{},,True,,1598403101.0,text,6,,,text,self.CasualConversation,True,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;So tonight it happened again! (2nd time so far since I joined Reddit). I&amp;#39;ve been called fishy &amp;amp; a catfish simply because some people find it hard to believe that I don&amp;#39;t look 31 yo from the picture I sent them. They then asked me to do verification photos or video call verification right off the bat, literally from the first ever conversation we had with each other. Although I explained myself pretty clear saying I would be up for video calls in the future when we get to know each other better, that didn&amp;#39;t seem to help unfortunately. Their reason is the bigger deal I make of it, makes me so suspicious?!? I&amp;#39;m not making it a big deal, I just simply want to find someone who wants to be my friend and be around me for who I am as a person, not how I look like. Is that too much to ask for?  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;YES appearances do matter! But only when it comes to romance, like if I&amp;#39;m looking to date you, yes we must be physically attracted to each other as well. But if all I want is friendship &amp;amp; nothing more, would a verification picture be worth more than losing someone genuinely want to get to know you? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The funny thing was I never even once asked them to send me a photo of themselves because they have a small photo on their profiles. That wouldn&amp;#39;t have been necessary anyway. I believe in putting a face to the name but when it comes to your motive &amp;amp; morals being questioned, I feel really uncomfortable. I&amp;#39;m very stubborn &amp;amp; the more they want me to do it, the higher chance that will never happen. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am  a 31 yo asian who happens to have a bit of a good gene so I don&amp;#39;t age naturally but I am old in so many ways. I usually use the excuse &amp;quot;I&amp;#39;m old&amp;quot; in a lot of things, I also am an old soul because I love handwritten letters &amp;amp; notes. I still keep all the letters I exchanged with people I met from the internet over 15 years ago. I take good care of myself &amp;amp; I have a very comfortable life with no stress from work or family drama. I have my own place, am financially independent. I have a life, a somewhat good one you know? I have much better things to spend time on than catfishing some random strangers on reddit. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That being said, I have only had one Reddit account for 3 years. I have met a few people in the past that I had multiple video calls with, even met up with some irl. There was one person whom I used to consider a very good friend of mine &amp;amp; we used to fall alseep together or spent countless hours on a video call. If I was a catfish, would I still be active on this account? And no I didn&amp;#39;t block him, I actually still follow him on here. &lt;/p&gt;

Kindly let me know all there is to know about it, considering that I&amp;#39;m a foreigner. The pros and cons, the requirements, cutoffs, pays, culture etc., could be points to focus on.
Arigato :)&lt;/p&gt;

Weirdly had an extremely realistic dream, where I'm pretty sure I could feel, not only emotion but physical assets aswell.
In this dream I was my self, but hopping forward in time, like watching only highlights of my (dream's) life.
I moved to a bigger apartment, enjoying life, met a girl, fell in love, met her family, we moved in together, held a healthy and romantic relationship.
The dream jumped to a ""today"" kind of scene, where time was running normally. Nothing special just happy, holding each other, watching a movie or what not, when an abrupt noise that I thought was from the movie was really a truck outside my window and woke me up.
My first instinct was to not make a lot of noise so I wouldn't wake up this girl aswell (oh yeah I never knew her name) to which I noticed that I was alone in my single bed hahah. But still I thought about texting/calling her and found weird that I didn't know what number to dial or what name to write on the search bar.

&lt;p&gt;Also, if you made it this far, thank you for reading! I guess I just wanted to get that out of my chest.&lt;/p&gt;

,CasualConversation,"Today I came across this Facebook post on my local community page, it was from this guy who had been living in a tent under a bridge. He's just a traveller, not living in poverty.

 In the post he was explaining how bridge painters and a few people working for the town had seen him there and told him to enjoy his stay, and there are no signs saying he cannot camp there.

 However this one local man came around with his dogs and threatened him that his tent will be burned down next time he came around. So now he's left with this terrifying feeling that if he left his tent before packing up, he'd come back to burned up home. 

At the end of the post he explained how he was reaching out to anyone who can help him do a bit of shopping and take it too him so that he didn't have to leave. So I offered. He wasn't asking for much, just 5 cans of soup and some Oreos, he was fed up of eating chicken and rice everyday.

Long story short-ish. - he was super greatfull and we ended up chatting for a couple hours, he was lovely. And it made me feel good just helping random people out. It also got me wondering how many people would have seen it, had spear time and a vehicle to help him but just didn't, I think there's probably more than we'd expect.

,CasualConversation,"What I mean by “early college” is exactly that. I am a junior in high school but I get to take classes at my local community college. They aren’t AP classes or anything like that, I’m going to college early. My classes aren’t just kids also doing the program but actual full time college students. 

I love my classes so much. I’m doing prerequisites for another program I want to transfer into so I’m taking a business class and a medical terminology class. In October I start another class to use as both a college credit and the high school credit I will need to graduate. But it’s only my second week of classes and I’ve already learned more than I have in my 3 years of high school.

,CasualConversation,"I think spiders are super interesting creatures, but I have like an extreme phobia of them. Like, I want to look up a wikipedia article or a journal and just read about some spiders, but I literally can't because  there's always 100% a picture of the spider. I cannot scroll on the page if there is a spider. If I'm on my phone, I of course jump because I'm scared, turn my phone off, open it with the phone or camera shortcut so I don't see the picture of the spider, then blindly close all apps. This isn't a problem with things like reddit, because the page refreshes when you close the app, but it also means I am stuck and need someone else's assistance if it's on a google tab because the google chrome app saves your last tabs, and I don't want to change those settings. In that case, I need to ask my family or friends to close out the tab. Literally, I don't know if you know about that picture of the lemurs in a circle, but that looks like a spider at first glance, and it scares the shit out of me. I jump at first, but upon realizing it's not a real spider, my brain says ""oh okay, it's not a spider, I'm fine"" and I can look at the image again. Same with things that look similar to spiders, like crabs. I am afraid of scorpions, but not as much. I can scroll with them, I just have to scroll very slowly and carefully or else I will literally jumpscare myself. I also lift my feet up next to my body when I encounter a spider or scorpion image.

Like, literally my fear of spiders is so bad that we went to Dairy Queen one time, and there was a giant ball of like black trashbags on the ceiling, with longer ones spread out to be like spider legs. I could literally not go into the Dairy Queen. My mom had to order without me by her side because I wouldn't go in. Halloween sucks so bad because I can't go near houses with spider props. Strangely, I'm not scared of those small spider rings that they tend to put on those fake cobwebs, possibly because I see they have the ring part on them? But even then, I'm not scared of the smaller spider props. Also, I'm not scared of those super duper tiny real spiders, like the ones that are literally half a centimeter. Once I'm able to see their details better I get scared. Like I guess the fact that they look 2D makes me not scared? But once they get a bit bigger, like jumping spiders, they become more 3D and then I'm scared of them. Daddy long legs are also considered 3D to me. I used to be scared of 2D drawings of like a circle and 8 lines coming out of it, but I'm not anymore. I just like really wish I could look more into them, because they are very interesting creatures and I hear a lot of cool facts every once in a while, but I wish I wasn't so scared of pictures of them.

Edit: forgot to mention, this is somewhat a cry for help lol. If someone could send me some cool spider facts I'd greatly appreciate it &lt;3

Before she went to bed we made a decision to read something interesting about the world, space, the oceans, whatever we feel each night so she can go to sleep thinking about it. A proud dad moment for me, and I'm smiling while I write this

Edit: even better, I have another one I can teach this sort of thing to once she's older. Happy days!!!!

Edit 2: there have been a few messages saying I'm a great father. I'm not, I will freely admit to half-assing a lot of things. Kids are endlessly annoying, as most parents will eventually admit, and sometimes you just want to stick them in their tablet to watch Teen Titans Go. With that said, I want my daughters to have a better life than I did, and to use their intelligence for something useful and life affirming. I'm an intelligent man who essentially wasted my talents, and I do not want the same for them. I don't want them to look back at 40 and think ""What If?"", and potentially perpetuate that to their children.

Edit 3: My goodness! Didn't expect this sort of response from a bit of a throwaway post. Thank you. I'm doing my best for my girls, and will continue to do so. They're my legacy, and the best thing I will ever do with my life, so I owe it to them to make sure they have the best opportunities available.

&lt;p&gt;Before she went to bed we made a decision to read something interesting about the world, space, the oceans, whatever we feel each night so she can go to sleep thinking about it. A proud dad moment for me, and I&amp;#39;m smiling while I write this&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Edit: even better, I have another one I can teach this sort of thing to once she&amp;#39;s older. Happy days!!!!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Edit 2: there have been a few messages saying I&amp;#39;m a great father. I&amp;#39;m not, I will freely admit to half-assing a lot of things. Kids are endlessly annoying, as most parents will eventually admit, and sometimes you just want to stick them in their tablet to watch Teen Titans Go. With that said, I want my daughters to have a better life than I did, and to use their intelligence for something useful and life affirming. I&amp;#39;m an intelligent man who essentially wasted my talents, and I do not want the same for them. I don&amp;#39;t want them to look back at 40 and think &amp;quot;What If?&amp;quot;, and potentially perpetuate that to their children.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Edit 3: My goodness! Didn&amp;#39;t expect this sort of response from a bit of a throwaway post. Thank you. I&amp;#39;m doing my best for my girls, and will continue to do so. They&amp;#39;re my legacy, and the best thing I will ever do with my life, so I owe it to them to make sure they have the best opportunities available. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For some of the other dads out there who want something to connect with their kids, check out Storybots on Netflix. We&amp;#39;ll sit and watch, laugh, and learn. It&amp;#39;s quality programming, and we&amp;#39;ve both learnt a lot.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He&amp;#39;s a little confused by the premise but is enjoying it so far! He doesn&amp;#39;t have a favorite pilot as of right now but keeps asking me spoiler related questions and I&amp;#39;m trying REALLY HARD not to spoil it for him. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We might watch a gundam series after this, but Im happy that a partner of mine is trying to learn about my interests!&lt;/p&gt;

Some back story. We got her almost 2 months ago, and she was around 7 months old. She used to be an outdoor cat and wasn't socialised to humans all that well.

My aunt and cousin told me it would be very hard, but I hadn't seen her in so long (family drama which estranged me from them as a child) I wanted to do it once before I lost the chance

It took me a while to recognize her even though my cousin showed me a picture from the last time I'd seen her

Her hair's all white now, and it seems that she lost an eye

She has Alzheimer so she probably didn't remember me, but when I asked, she said she did, I didn't really believe her, but then a few minutes later she said I wasn't from around here, and it's true, I'm not, and I never was

She couldn't really speak much, and when she did she didn't make much sense, but there's a few things I did understand

The clearest thing she said, and she looked like she really knew who I was when she said it was : ""You have no idea how beautiful you are""

At some point, I think she asked me if I was ready to let her go, I wasn't sure I'd heard her right, but I said ""No"" regardless. She told me that's just how life goes. That's the only moment I cried a little.

She was looking at things that weren't there.

I hugged her, kissed her, told her I loved her.

There were a couple of times she said the first two (out of three) syllables of my first name. No word starts with these.

Maybe there were moments she really could tell who I was. 

She looked happiest when I showed her the pictures of my nephew, her great-grandson, but she looked upset when I tried showing her pictures of things she'd lived through, so I gave that up

Before leaving, I crouched next to her wheelchair and I leabed lightly against her arm, she brought it up to scratch and pet my hair. 

It felt nice.

She doesn't have much longer, and it's sad but also... I'm weirdly okay with that. She's 83. I'm not even sure I'll ever be that old, but she was once as old as I was.

I once was a baby, like my nephew is.

I once was a child, like my cousins' children are.

Right now I'm an adult, and maybe I'll never be as old as her, but it doesn't really matter, I have my own life to live, she's had hers, now I have mine, we all grow and go through the same stages.

I'm not as saddened by the ignorance of the children playing, unknowing of the sadness and the pain that awaits them in the world.

,CasualConversation,"Earlier this year, right as the pandemic was starting to heat up, I found myself on the opposite coast of the US from my home state and needed to purchase a car to get myself back across the country. I found an affordable, used, newer-model vehicle at a dealership.

Today, I received a strange hand-written letter from the dealership, along with a business card. They explained that they had a customer who was looking for the exact make, model, year, and color as my car, and they were willing to offer me up to $2000 above the trade-in value to buy the car back from me, if I still had it. There is nothing outwardly interesting about this vehicle, that would explain why someone was so intent about finding this exact model. In fact, with a carfax search I found dozens of the exact same vehicle within a few hundred miles of where I purchased it, at close to the same price I purchased it at.

I puzzled over the letter for a minute. I could use the money more than I could use the car right now, so it's an appealing offer. But my mind quickly went to the wonderful Sherlock Holmes short story ""The Blue Carbuncle,"" in which a Christmas goose with a stolen gemstone in its stomach is accidentally sold to an unknowing customer, leading to the thief's desperate efforts to track down the hapless buyer.

Is there a bunch of drugs or cash or diamonds stashed in my car somewhere? The person who sent this letter evidently knows the vehicle is thousands of miles away from them, as they reached me at my home address. What could explain their desire to reclaim this specific car, from thousands of miles away, at the extra cost of transportation and a much higher trade-in value?

Some other details that may or may not be relevant:

&amp;#x200B;

\-The previous owner of the vehicle was a rental car company(in a state with a reputation for higher-than-average criminal activity.)

\-The letter has no return address written on it, although it does contain a business card for and is signed by someone I personally dealt with at the dealership

\-The dealership was in full-on Covid-mode(skeleton crew,) when I made the purchase, so I dealt with someone who was not actually a salesman but was instead the financing guy, who was clearly not super familiar with the inventory.

\-Although both cars were listed online, the car that I was originally interested in was nowhere to be found on the lot, and no one knew where it was, so I went for the one that that was the same year, make, almost the same model, but a different color

\-There seems to be a discrepancy between the actual color of the vehicle and what is listed on the title. (neither matches the color of the other vehicle I was looking to buy, at all) Have they made some huge dealership fuckup that they are trying to quietly rectify?

\-Last night between 1am and 6:30am three unlocked cars in my apartment driveway were accessed and rifled though, which has never happened before, not in the driveway, although this isn't a particularly good neighborhood. My car was locked, or at least, had been locked by this morning, and showed no sign of break-in. 

&amp;#x200B;

Anyway, I thought this was kind of a fun turn of events for me, and others might have insight or enjoy puzzling over it.

&lt;p&gt;Today, I received a strange hand-written letter from the dealership, along with a business card. They explained that they had a customer who was looking for the exact make, model, year, and color as my car, and they were willing to offer me up to $2000 above the trade-in value to buy the car back from me, if I still had it. There is nothing outwardly interesting about this vehicle, that would explain why someone was so intent about finding this exact model. In fact, with a carfax search I found dozens of the exact same vehicle within a few hundred miles of where I purchased it, at close to the same price I purchased it at.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I puzzled over the letter for a minute. I could use the money more than I could use the car right now, so it&amp;#39;s an appealing offer. But my mind quickly went to the wonderful Sherlock Holmes short story &amp;quot;The Blue Carbuncle,&amp;quot; in which a Christmas goose with a stolen gemstone in its stomach is accidentally sold to an unknowing customer, leading to the thief&amp;#39;s desperate efforts to track down the hapless buyer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Is there a bunch of drugs or cash or diamonds stashed in my car somewhere? The person who sent this letter evidently knows the vehicle is thousands of miles away from them, as they reached me at my home address. What could explain their desire to reclaim this specific car, from thousands of miles away, at the extra cost of transportation and a much higher trade-in value?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some other details that may or may not be relevant:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;-The previous owner of the vehicle was a rental car company(in a state with a reputation for higher-than-average criminal activity.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;-The letter has no return address written on it, although it does contain a business card for and is signed by someone I personally dealt with at the dealership&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;-The dealership was in full-on Covid-mode(skeleton crew,) when I made the purchase, so I dealt with someone who was not actually a salesman but was instead the financing guy, who was clearly not super familiar with the inventory.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;-Although both cars were listed online, the car that I was originally interested in was nowhere to be found on the lot, and no one knew where it was, so I went for the one that that was the same year, make, almost the same model, but a different color&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;-There seems to be a discrepancy between the actual color of the vehicle and what is listed on the title. (neither matches the color of the other vehicle I was looking to buy, at all) Have they made some huge dealership fuckup that they are trying to quietly rectify?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;-Last night between 1am and 6:30am three unlocked cars in my apartment driveway were accessed and rifled though, which has never happened before, not in the driveway, although this isn&amp;#39;t a particularly good neighborhood. My car was locked, or at least, had been locked by this morning, and showed no sign of break-in. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyway, I thought this was kind of a fun turn of events for me, and others might have insight or enjoy puzzling over it. I&amp;#39;m open to ideas on how to safely take advantage of the situation for personal gain, since I&amp;#39;m not particularly interested in fighting crime just for the sake of it, as long as no one is getting hurt.&lt;/p&gt;

,CasualConversation,"I have broken it down in simple steps for you:

1. If Pinocchio says, ""My nose grows."" completely out of the blue, he is lying, because his nose is not growing. Because he is lying, his nose has to grow. We will come back to this later. 

2. As soon as Pinocchio's nose starts growing because of his lie, it stops growing immediately, for it is not a lie anymore. 

3. In conclusion, Pinocchios nose does grow, but only for an infinitely small amount of time and distance.

If you did not understand, look below.

A) Pinocchio: *my nose grows*
B)1) nose was not growing, so what he said was a lie
B)2) nose grows because he lied
C) it isn't a lie anymore, because his nose is now growing

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;If Pinocchio says, &amp;quot;My nose grows.&amp;quot; completely out of the blue, he is lying, because his nose is not growing. Because he is lying, his nose has to grow. We will come back to this later. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;As soon as Pinocchio&amp;#39;s nose starts growing because of his lie, it stops growing immediately, for it is not a lie anymore. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;In conclusion, Pinocchios nose does grow, but only for an infinitely small amount of time and distance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you did not understand, look below.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A) Pinocchio: &lt;em&gt;my nose grows&lt;/em&gt;
B)1) nose was not growing, so what he said was a lie
B)2) nose grows because he lied
C) it isn&amp;#39;t a lie anymore, because his nose is now growing
D) nose stops growing as soon as it starts, because he was not lying (see C)
E, concl.) Nose grows for an infinitely small amount, because as soon as his nose started growing, it stoped, since he wasn&amp;#39;t lying&lt;/p&gt;

Some background to my story: 3 years ago I had a friend group consisting of me, D, S, M and L. we were all friends since school and had moved to another city for university. but soon we faced some trouble since D and L weren't getting along anymore because of various reasons (including mental health and jealously). So they had a major fight and broke off contact completely. that was followed by S not talking to L. Because D, S and I spent so much time together when it happened, me and L kinda had a fall out even though nothing particular happened between us. M and L stayed friends though.
Since then our friend group doesn't exist anymore. D and I had a major disagreement last year which resulted in D and S cutting me and M off. 

Cue to a few weeks ago. it was Ms birthday and she wanted to celebrate it with her 3 closest friends, me, L and one of her childhood friends. we decided to grab dinner and have a board game night. Note that L and I haven't spoken since then.
I was so nervous about meeting her again and it being awkward or she being mad at me for never reaching out or anything.
So yesterday we four met up and it was great! me and L reconnected immediately and fell into an easy banter as if nothing happened. we even found out that we don't live far from each other and she even proposed meeting up next week, just the two of us to catch up.

When I got home from the get-together I felt so happy I literally cried happy tears! I have been so worried and for absolutely no reason.
But today I was thinking about the old times and how I never tried getting in contact with her again and I felt so guilty because she must've felt so alone, losing 3 friends at once, when things fell apart. I'm contemplating whether I should apologize for my behavior or not and what timing would be best. I also don't want to make her uncomfortable in case she just wants to forget what happened...

I knew I wanted to do something sweet for her and I also wanted a nice quiet date with her while watching anime or something. So, I suggested that we watch an anime that night on this app called Rave. The app was a huge pain in the ass but somehow I managed to get it to work and we watched My Neighbour Totoro. At 11:55, about 6 or 7 of her close friends joined the Rave and we all surprised her ( or at least, tried to. Let's be honest. She's super smart).

If I may, I would like to tell you what we would have done if we had been in the same place. I've been fantasising about this for the better part of a week.

Our day would start out with waking up late (around 9-ish), a lovely homemade breakfast that she loves, some cuddling and cake, lunch (either outside or I would have made something special at home), a nap and some reading in the afternoon. Come evening, have coffee (for me) and tea (for her), then we'd have gone for a walk either in a quiet park or the beach.

Because of the quarantine, we&amp;#39;re stranded in two different cities about 500 km away from each other.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I knew I wanted to do something sweet for her and I also wanted a nice quiet date with her while watching anime or something. So, I suggested that we watch an anime that night on this app called Rave. The app was a huge pain in the ass but somehow I managed to get it to work and we watched My Neighbour Totoro. At 11:55, about 6 or 7 of her close friends joined the Rave and we all surprised her ( or at least, tried to. Let&amp;#39;s be honest. She&amp;#39;s super smart).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If I may, I would like to tell you what we would have done if we had been in the same place. I&amp;#39;ve been fantasising about this for the better part of a week.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our day would start out with waking up late (around 9-ish), a lovely homemade breakfast that she loves, some cuddling and cake, lunch (either outside or I would have made something special at home), a nap and some reading in the afternoon. Come evening, have coffee (for me) and tea (for her), then we&amp;#39;d have gone for a walk either in a quiet park or the beach. After that, dinner with our friends, then come back home, watch anime and sleep off in each other&amp;#39;s arms.&lt;/p&gt;

,CasualConversation,So I was hanging out with a friend and we stopped at a gas station to get snacks and drinks. I grabbed some gummy worms which are key to the story. When we left the gas station we pulled out to a red light and were waiting so I opened the gummy worms and started eating. I offered some to my friend which in the process I looked over and wasn’t paying attention to the light. Anyways it turned green as I looked away so my reaction to take off was slightly delayed. What’s crazy is at that moment a big truck came barreling through the red light probably 20mph over the limit. If I hadn’t bought the gummy worms which had distracted me and took my eyes off the light my friend and I could have been t-boned and possibly killed.
