poem,"She laid her head on the pillow beside me,
Flyaway curls spread across the downy lint,
Her eyes closed, her spine convex,
Slim hands reachingf or someone
In the empty space, though my warmth
Emanated, and my eyes breathed in
Every perfect lash, line and mark on
Her canvas that she did not paint and which
She could not see, and every little piece of
Beauty she thought she could never be.

I knew those hands
Would never reach me.",0,

poem,"I snuck a lighter from the kitchen
When I was fifteeni not to smoke: to smell.
I lit incense stick after incense stick,
And inhaled sandalwood smoldering,
As the drunkards climbed the stairs,
Swallowing tar and solute methane,
But really, what is the difference?
We escape our minds with our senses:
Chemical compounds to rid
Us of our demons.
They laughed the night away,
And I heard their chortles echo
As they strolled the empty streets
To rid themselves of the pain
Of guilt and all the trials
Life so unpityingly hands us,
And to endorse the transience
Of which we make
By a swig, a drag, or a cut,
A smell, a kiss, or
A word.",0,
poem,"Winter Mind - It's a shadow that sweeps over you.
Grey skies. Charcoal streets coated with grime
And glistening wetness under rusted lampposts.
Rain-splattered glass,the drops slidingd own car windows like tears.
The eternal, slow, steady rain falling, on cold days through fog.
Tangled, windswept hair. Stale black coffee.
Dust building on the spines of unopened books.
The color draining from floral-patterned sheets and curios
In bedrooms like tea-dregs giving way to crumpled black clothes
And silence.
Splinters of dark aluminum sunrays refracting
Through the gaps in drawn curtains.
Time passing in a colorless blur between day and night.
The weeks stretching into an endless winter,:
Kept inside to rot like a dying plant. Eyes opening only to wish,
To cling on to the only thing you know; that death will come to you.
Sad songs become a daily commodity.
Not even talking can expunge this melancholy,
There will soon be nothing left to extract.
Silence.
The time has passed for brutal honesty,
For there is no energy left to bellow out the troubles of your world.
You want to be alone, but you crave company.
But in your heart you know that no one wants to be dragged
Into your toxic,m orose-riddend omain.
It's an emptiness that food cannot fill.
A detachment that paralyzes your neurotransmitters.
Cold numbness.
Wait for the high, it'll come some time.
For now, there is nothing but your thoughts,
And silence.",0,
poem,"Cavity -  She is empty.
